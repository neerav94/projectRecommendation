I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud Computing [7] has become the essential requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Industry is growing 
at a very good pace, and providing essential services i.e. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), network as a service 
(NaaS), platform as a service   (PaaS),   software   as   a   service   (SaaS).   Due   to significant cost saving many 
smaller and medium sized organizations  are  also  looking  forward  for  using  cloud services. The emerging 
demand for cloud services is driven by continuing globalization, consumer acceptance of technology, economic   
downturn   and   the   growth   of   the   extended enterprise. Cloud Computing [8] enables many organizations 
to  limit  the  large  capital  investment  that  is  associated  with  costly  data  centers  and  for  the  applications  and 
transforming these costs into operating expenses paying for cloud resources only as required. Moreover, using 
the cloud services enables the end users to speed up tome to market since it uses pre-existing virtual technology 
and infrastructure that can be delivered and used globally. 

 
So  basically  cloud    computing  is  combination    of  very    well-known  and  existing  technologies  that  were 
available is the early 1990s i.e. grid computing, utility computing and virtualization. Each of these technologies 
form the  essential  component in the  layers  of  cloud  computing,  which allows  the  end  users  to  pay  only  what 
resources they have used. 

  
In today market many cloud providers are available, choosing an optimal cloud provider has always  been a 
challenge for an organization  which  is  looking  for  implementing  cloud   or using its services. Organization 
should understand on what factors a specific cloud provider should be opted. Understanding requirements first

need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  for  selecting  the  appropriate  solution.  The  intent  of  this  chapter  to  give 
overview  of  good  cloud  providers  available  in  market.  A  cloud  service  provider  offers  customers  storage  or 
software services available via a private (private cloud)  or  public  network  (cloud).  Usually, it  means  the 
storage  and  software  is  available  for  access  via  the  Internet.  So,  in  this  chapter  we  will  briefly  discuss  about 
some cloud providers.

According  to  the  documentation  “OpenStack  Compute  is  the  internal    fabric    of    the    cloud    creating    and  
managing    large  groups  of  virtual  private  servers”  and  “OpenStack  Object  Storage  is  software  for  creating 
Redundant,      scalable      object      storage      using      clusters      of  commodity  servers  to  store  Terabytes  or  even 
petabytes of data. 

 

 
OpenStack main characteristics [10] are that is: 

 
•  Open:  The  entire  code  of  OpenStack  is  open  and  therefore    can    be    updated    or    modified    as    per  
requirement. There are certain validations process that must be processed for the adoption  and development of 
new standards. 

 
•  Compatible  and  Flexible:  OpenStack  is  very  flexible  and  supports  most  virtualization  solutions  of  the 

market: ESX, Hyper-V, KVM, QEMU, UML, Xen and XenServer. 

  
• Scalable: OpenStack is very much scalable and is already deployed in companies in which data volumes is 

measured in petabytes and is scalable upto 1 million physical machines. 

 

C.   Eucalyptus 

Eucalyptus is an open source + commercial IaaS service provider. Eucalyptus is the short form for „Elastic 
Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs to useful Systems‟. Each and every Eucalyptus cloud will 
be  having  one  or  many  Node  Controllers  per  Cluster  Controller  which  controls  VM  activities-  launching, 
termination,  inspection,  clean-up  of  instances.    The    Cluster    Controller    manages    a    collection    of  Node 
Controllers,  manages  access  to  public  and  modular  and  extensible    architecture;    thus,    it    is    very    easy    to  
implement  third-party  tool  integration.  Private  networks,  controls  execution  of  virtual  machines  and  manages 
virtual  networking.  Every  Eucalyptus  cloud  have  multiple  Cluster  Controllers.  A  Cloud  Controller  manages 
virtualized resources; each  Eucalyptus  cloud  will  have  a single CLC.

According  to  the  documentation  “OpenStack  Compute  is  the  internal    fabric    of    the    cloud    creating    and  
managing    large  groups  of  virtual  private  servers”  and  “OpenStack  Object  Storage  is  software  for  creating 
Redundant,      scalable      object      storage      using      clusters      of  commodity  servers  to  store  Terabytes  or  even 
petabytes of data. 

 

 
OpenStack main characteristics [10] are that is: 

 
•  Open:  The  entire  code  of  OpenStack  is  open  and  therefore    can    be    updated    or    modified    as    per  
requirement. There are certain validations process that must be processed for the adoption  and development of 
new standards. 

 
•  Compatible  and  Flexible:  OpenStack  is  very  flexible  and  supports  most  virtualization  solutions  of  the 

market: ESX, Hyper-V, KVM, QEMU, UML, Xen and XenServer. 

  
• Scalable: OpenStack is very much scalable and is already deployed in companies in which data volumes is 

measured in petabytes and is scalable upto 1 million physical machines. 

 

C.   Eucalyptus 

Eucalyptus is an open source + commercial IaaS service provider. Eucalyptus is the short form for „Elastic 
Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs to useful Systems‟. Each and every Eucalyptus cloud will 
be  having  one  or  many  Node  Controllers  per  Cluster  Controller  which  controls  VM  activities-  launching, 
termination,  inspection,  clean-up  of  instances.    The    Cluster    Controller    manages    a    collection    of  Node 
Controllers,  manages  access  to  public  and  modular  and  extensible    architecture;    thus,    it    is    very    easy    to  
implement  third-party  tool  integration.  Private  networks,  controls  execution  of  virtual  machines  and  manages 
virtual  networking.  Every  Eucalyptus  cloud  have  multiple  Cluster  Controllers.  A  Cloud  Controller  manages 
virtualized resources; each  Eucalyptus  cloud  will  have  a single CLC.

Abstract— IT world is changing. Evolution of cloud computing in recent past has brought drastic change in 
era of IT field. Major advantage of cloud computing is that the hardware need not to be upgraded as Cloud 
Services  provides  everything  of  demand  basis.  Consuming  electricity  is  the  best  example  by  which  cloud 
computing can be explained, just pay for whatever you used.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of 
leading cloud providers such as Amazon Cloud Services, Rackspace powered   by   OpenStack   and   other   
open   source   Cloud providers.   Further discussing about how to implement OpenStack or just trying out by 
Devstack  and  Trystack  just  for  testing  purpose  and  at  last  covering  releases  and  recent  work  going  on  in 
OpenStack. The  aim  of  this  paper  is to  show  importance of  OpenStack  as  a  Cloud  provider and  how  to get 
started with OpenStack.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud Computing [7] has become the essential requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Industry is growing 
at a very good pace, and providing essential services i.e. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), network as a service 
(NaaS), platform as a service   (PaaS),   software   as   a   service   (SaaS).   Due   to significant cost saving many 
smaller and medium sized organizations  are  also  looking  forward  for  using  cloud services. The emerging 
demand for cloud services is driven by continuing globalization, consumer acceptance of technology, economic   
downturn   and   the   growth   of   the   extended enterprise. Cloud Computing [8] enables many organizations 
to  limit  the  large  capital  investment  that  is  associated  with  costly  data  centers  and  for  the  applications  and 
transforming these costs into operating expenses paying for cloud resources only as required. Moreover, using 
the cloud services enables the end users to speed up tome to market since it uses pre-existing virtual technology 
and infrastructure that can be delivered and used globally. 

 
So  basically  cloud    computing  is  combination    of  very    well-known  and  existing  technologies  that  were 
available is the early 1990s i.e. grid computing, utility computing and virtualization. Each of these technologies 
form the  essential  component in the  layers  of  cloud  computing,  which allows  the  end  users  to  pay  only  what 
resources they have used. 

  
In today market many cloud providers are available, choosing an optimal cloud provider has always  been a 
challenge for an organization  which  is  looking  for  implementing  cloud   or using its services. Organization 
should understand on what factors a specific cloud provider should be opted. Understanding requirements first

and  discussing  with  all  the  stakeholders  is  very  important  so  as  to  search  for  the  desired  cloud      provider.   
Leading   cloud   providers   available   are Amazon EMC2 [1], OpenStack [2], CloudStack [3] Open Nebula [4], 
Eucalyptus  [5]  etc.  In  this  paper  we  will  be  discussing  little  about  Rackspace  [6]  cloud  that  is  power  by 
OpenStack, Amazon Cloud Provider and some open source cloud providers like Open Nebula. 

 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2  brief  review  of    cloud    computing    and    different    cloud  
providers. Introduction to cloud computing and cloud service providers [12]. Next part gives brief introduction 
of OpenStack and how it  can  be  implemented.  Last part covers  the  current  work going on in OpenStack.. 

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  [5]  has  emerged  as  a  flashing  model  of  providing  IT  infrastructure  to  a  large  and  small 
companies both private and public. When it comes to organization to choosing a cloud provider several points 
need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  for  selecting  the  appropriate  solution.  The  intent  of  this  chapter  to  give 
overview  of  good  cloud  providers  available  in  market.  A  cloud  service  provider  offers  customers  storage  or 
software services available via a private (private cloud)  or  public  network  (cloud).  Usually, it  means  the 
storage  and  software  is  available  for  access  via  the  Internet.  So,  in  this  chapter  we  will  briefly  discuss  about 
some cloud providers.

B.  Comparing Rackspace (OpenStack with Amazon Cloud Services) 

There  has  been  always  a  competition  between  these  two  cloud  providers.  In  the  following  part  we  will  be 
comparing  the  both  cloud  providers  in  detail.  Rackspace  greatest  asset  is  OpenStack.  Rackspace  provides  a 
superb Support whereas Amazon is not very good known for its customer Support. Amazon always tries to keep 
power on but if the power goes off, the user is in dark until Amazon restores its services. Both the Amazon and 
Windows Azure don‟t have strong reputations in terms of customer support. It doesn‟t matter  how  small  or  
large  business  is,  Rackspace support phone picks up quickly. The operators of Rack Space route the customers 
to experts who easily understand and troubleshoot network, storage, computer, database and other cloud issues. 
Rackspace  also  has  an  advantage  over  others  that  the  users  using  Rackspace  with  OpenStack  can  easily 
implement   a   flexible,   scalable   and   reliable   solution. OpenStack  means  that  the  cloud  will  be  flexible  
and  will attract more and more customers to keep them away from AWS. 

 
Rackspace‟s  has  a  very  simple  interface  as  compared  with  one  of  AWS.  User‟s  request  for  server  like 
Ubuntu 12.10, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB disk will only take minutes to get ready which on other hand on EC2 is bit 
more  difficult.  But  EC2  offers  one  good  option  that  users  can  either  selects  a  classic  or  quick  wizard  for 
launching the instance. 

  

Both  Rackspace  and  AWS provide  a  browser-based  terminal  connection.  For  connecting to  Rackspace  server, 
user can user iTerm, or SSH compatible terminal. Then user has to ping his server and then it will connect to the 
server using username and password provided to user. It only takes about 15 minutes. But in case of EC2 server, 
it  seems  to  be  much  more  complex  For  EC2  user  has  to  download  a  keypair  for  SSH  and  after  that  maze  of 
options from Amazon, it connects to server. 

 

IV. INSTALLING OPENSTACK USING DEVSTACK AND TRYSTACK 

In this  section  we  will  explain  the  steps the installing  private  cloud  using  Devstack  [13].  If  you  are  lack  of 
resources and still want to learn cloud practically,   then   Devstack  is   the  best  option   available. Devstack 
can be installed on your laptop and you can easily experience cloud environment within some hours. Now I will 
be discussing all the steps required to install Devstack on your local machine. 

 
i.     Add a user to install Devstack. Adduser stack 
ii.    Give sudo privileges to this user stack. To do this, edit the sudoers.sh file and all the following command 
at last of sudoers.sh file 
stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 
iii.   From here on you should use the Stack user you created. 
iv.   Download Devstack 
sudo apt-get install git -y || yum install -y git

and  discussing  with  all  the  stakeholders  is  very  important  so  as  to  search  for  the  desired  cloud      provider.   
Leading   cloud   providers   available   are Amazon EMC2 [1], OpenStack [2], CloudStack [3] Open Nebula [4], 
Eucalyptus  [5]  etc.  In  this  paper  we  will  be  discussing  little  about  Rackspace  [6]  cloud  that  is  power  by 
OpenStack, Amazon Cloud Provider and some open source cloud providers like Open Nebula. 

 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2  brief  review  of    cloud    computing    and    different    cloud  
providers. Introduction to cloud computing and cloud service providers [12]. Next part gives brief introduction 
of OpenStack and how it  can  be  implemented.  Last part covers  the  current  work going on in OpenStack.. 

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  [5]  has  emerged  as  a  flashing  model  of  providing  IT  infrastructure  to  a  large  and  small 
companies both private and public. When it comes to organization to choosing a cloud provider several points 
need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  for  selecting  the  appropriate  solution.  The  intent  of  this  chapter  to  give 
overview  of  good  cloud  providers  available  in  market.  A  cloud  service  provider  offers  customers  storage  or 
software services available via a private (private cloud)  or  public  network  (cloud).  Usually, it  means  the 
storage  and  software  is  available  for  access  via  the  Internet.  So,  in  this  chapter  we  will  briefly  discuss  about 
some cloud providers. 

 

 

 

A.  Amazon Web 

Fig 1. General Architecture of Cloud 

AWS  is  defined  as  the  collection  on  remote  computing services that together helps in making up cloud 
computing  platform.  It  is  provided  by  Amazon.com.  Amazon  EC2  and  Amazon  S3  are  the  most  well-known 
services  offered  by  it.  It  provides  large  computing  capacity  and  faster  and  cheaper  than  that  of  building  a 
physical server. Companies using AWS are like 8K Miles, 99 Designs, Adobe Systems, Dextra, Engine Yard, 
Ericsson, Global Blue, Mahindra Systems, SAP, Site 24*7. 

 

B.   OpenStack 

OpenStack,  the  Linux of cloud  computing.  OpenStack  has become  the  world‟s leading  cloud  platform  
that    is    open.  OpenStack  is  the  worldwide  global  collaboration  of  all  developers  and  other  cloud  computing 
technologists that produce  the  ubiquitous  open  source  cloud  platforms  for private  and  public  clouds.  The  
OpenStack    project    aims    to  offer  solutions  for  all  cloud  to  being  simple  to  implement  and  which  can  be 
scalable  and  feature  rich.  More  than  190  companies  have  joined  the  OpenStack  project  that  includes:  Intel, 
NetApp,  Citrix,  Dell,  AMD,  Canonical,  HP,  Cisco,  Red  Hat,    AT&T    and    IBM,    Rackspace    [9],    IFCA,  
Sina.com, NASA, DreamHost.

Fig 2. OpenStack Architecture 

 

 

According  to  the  documentation  “OpenStack  Compute  is  the  internal    fabric    of    the    cloud    creating    and  
managing    large  groups  of  virtual  private  servers”  and  “OpenStack  Object  Storage  is  software  for  creating 
Redundant,      scalable      object      storage      using      clusters      of  commodity  servers  to  store  Terabytes  or  even 
petabytes of data. 

 

 
OpenStack main characteristics [10] are that is: 

 
•  Open:  The  entire  code  of  OpenStack  is  open  and  therefore    can    be    updated    or    modified    as    per  
requirement. There are certain validations process that must be processed for the adoption  and development of 
new standards. 

 
•  Compatible  and  Flexible:  OpenStack  is  very  flexible  and  supports  most  virtualization  solutions  of  the 

market: ESX, Hyper-V, KVM, QEMU, UML, Xen and XenServer. 

  
• Scalable: OpenStack is very much scalable and is already deployed in companies in which data volumes is 

measured in petabytes and is scalable upto 1 million physical machines. 

 

C.   Eucalyptus 

Eucalyptus is an open source + commercial IaaS service provider. Eucalyptus is the short form for „Elastic 
Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs to useful Systems‟. Each and every Eucalyptus cloud will 
be  having  one  or  many  Node  Controllers  per  Cluster  Controller  which  controls  VM  activities-  launching, 
termination,  inspection,  clean-up  of  instances.    The    Cluster    Controller    manages    a    collection    of  Node 
Controllers,  manages  access  to  public  and  modular  and  extensible    architecture;    thus,    it    is    very    easy    to  
implement  third-party  tool  integration.  Private  networks,  controls  execution  of  virtual  machines  and  manages 
virtual  networking.  Every  Eucalyptus  cloud  have  multiple  Cluster  Controllers.  A  Cloud  Controller  manages 
virtualized resources; each  Eucalyptus  cloud  will  have  a single CLC.

D.  Open Nebula 

Open Nebula manages virtual infrastructure to build public, private,  public  and  hybrid  as  Service  Clouds.  
It  manages virtualization,  storage,  network,  monitoring  and  security. Open   Nebula   allows   to   build   and   
manage   virtualized enterprise data centers and IaaS clouds with core values such as   openness,   cooperation   
and   innovation.   Open   Nebula provides AWS EC2 and EbS API, and self-service portal for cloud  consumers. 
It provides a  powerful CLI  which looks same  as  UNIX  commands.  Security  is  available  via  user, group 
and role management, as well as access control lists, auditing,  and  isolation  at  different  levels.  Open  Nebula 
adheres to a modular and extensible architecture; thus, it is very easy to implement third-party tool integration.

A.  Comparing of OpenStack with Eucalyptus and Open Nebula [11] 

There  are  also  comparative  studies  of  different  solutions.  It  is  essentially  an  overview  of  the  solutions 
Eucalyptus,  OpenNebula  and  a  presentation  of  their  different  characteristics.  In,  comparative  studies  of 
Eucalyptus and OpenNebula including architectures, features, characteristics, architectures and applications are 
done  in  order  to  provide  more  freedom  of  choice  for  the  users  of  the  cloud.  Different  solutions  exist  for  the 
deployment  of  open  source  clouds.  Among  these,  we  have  Eucalyptus,  OpenStack  and  OpenNebula.    We  
propose  a  comparative  study  of  the  last three solutions in order to select the most appropriate solution to our 
criteria. These include popularity, community use, modularity, openness, open source. Figures 2 and 3 show a 
comparison of the solutions using Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and OpenStack in all countries between April 2010 
and April 2012 and the interest of some countries to these solutions.

B.  Comparing Rackspace (OpenStack with Amazon Cloud Services) 

There  has  been  always  a  competition  between  these  two  cloud  providers.  In  the  following  part  we  will  be 
comparing  the  both  cloud  providers  in  detail.  Rackspace  greatest  asset  is  OpenStack.  Rackspace  provides  a 
superb Support whereas Amazon is not very good known for its customer Support. Amazon always tries to keep 
power on but if the power goes off, the user is in dark until Amazon restores its services. Both the Amazon and 
Windows Azure don‟t have strong reputations in terms of customer support. It doesn‟t matter  how  small  or  
large  business  is,  Rackspace support phone picks up quickly. The operators of Rack Space route the customers 
to experts who easily understand and troubleshoot network, storage, computer, database and other cloud issues. 
Rackspace  also  has  an  advantage  over  others  that  the  users  using  Rackspace  with  OpenStack  can  easily 
implement   a   flexible,   scalable   and   reliable   solution. OpenStack  means  that  the  cloud  will  be  flexible  
and  will attract more and more customers to keep them away from AWS. 

 
Rackspace‟s  has  a  very  simple  interface  as  compared  with  one  of  AWS.  User‟s  request  for  server  like 
Ubuntu 12.10, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB disk will only take minutes to get ready which on other hand on EC2 is bit 
more  difficult.  But  EC2  offers  one  good  option  that  users  can  either  selects  a  classic  or  quick  wizard  for 
launching the instance. 

  

Both  Rackspace  and  AWS provide  a  browser-based  terminal  connection.  For  connecting to  Rackspace  server, 
user can user iTerm, or SSH compatible terminal. Then user has to ping his server and then it will connect to the 
server using username and password provided to user. It only takes about 15 minutes. But in case of EC2 server, 
it  seems  to  be  much  more  complex  For  EC2  user  has  to  download  a  keypair  for  SSH  and  after  that  maze  of 
options from Amazon, it connects to server. 

 

IV. INSTALLING OPENSTACK USING DEVSTACK AND TRYSTACK 

In this  section  we  will  explain  the  steps the installing  private  cloud  using  Devstack  [13].  If  you  are  lack  of 
resources and still want to learn cloud practically,   then   Devstack  is   the  best  option   available. Devstack 
can be installed on your laptop and you can easily experience cloud environment within some hours. Now I will 
be discussing all the steps required to install Devstack on your local machine. 

 
i.     Add a user to install Devstack. Adduser stack 
ii.    Give sudo privileges to this user stack. To do this, edit the sudoers.sh file and all the following command 
at last of sudoers.sh file 
stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 
iii.   From here on you should use the Stack user you created. 
iv.   Download Devstack 
sudo apt-get install git -y || yum install -y git

Paramjot Singh et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.3, March- 2014, pg. 121-127 

git clone git://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git cd Devstack 
v.     Run Devstack 
Now to configure stack.sh. Devstack includes a sample in devstack/samples/localrc. Create localrc as shown 
below : 
FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.1.224/27 
FIXED_RANGE=10.11.12.0/24 
FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE=256 
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth0 
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret  
MYSQL_PASSWORD=iheartdatabase  
RABBIT_PASSWORD=flopsymopsy  
SERVICE_PASSWORD=iheartksl 
vi.   Run Devstack: 
./stack.sh 
At  this  point  Devstack  is  installed  on  your  machine.  Now  you  can  open  localhost  on  your  browser  and 
OpenStack  Dashboard  will  be  opened.  Just  login  with  the  credentials  of  username  “admin”  and  password 
“admin”.  
 
  

Fig 5. OpenStack Dashboard 

 

 
After this you can create the keypair, by clicking on access and security tab in the dashboard and download it. 
Devstack comes up with a default image of cirros operating system. Click on Image tab and launch the instance. 
Give the instance name and then click on launch. Once the instance is launched, run the image in console and 
Open your Ubuntu terminal. Add the keypair from terminal and then simply by using ssh command connect to 
the instance created via dashboard. Your ubuntu terminal will be connected to the cirros instance that is created 
by Devstack. 

 
Launch the instance with secure connection. 
 
Steps to SSH into an instance by  using the keypair that was recently downloaded. 
1. Download the MyKey.pem file from the OpenStack Dashboard. 
2. In a command line interface, modify the access to the .pem file: 
$ chmod 0600 MyKey.pem 
3. Use the ssh-add command to ensure that the keypair is known to SSH: 
$ ssh-add MyKey.pem 
4. Copy the IP address from the MyFirstInstance. 
5. Use the SSH command to make a secure connection to the instance: 
$ ssh -i MyKey.pem ubuntu@10.0.0.2 
You should see a prompt asking "Are you sure you want no)?" Type yes and you have successfully connected. 
Once you type yes, you will experience cloud IaaS that you created by OpenStack Dashboard. Now you can 
install  whatever  software  you  want  to  use  on  the  cloud  and  then  can  connect  the  cloud  machine  to  other 
machines  connected  on  the  network.  You  can  experience  services  of  cloud  like  software  as  a  service  by

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud Computing [7] has become the essential requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Industry is growing 
at a very good pace, and providing essential services i.e. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), network as a service 
(NaaS), platform as a service   (PaaS),   software   as   a   service   (SaaS).   Due   to significant cost saving many 
smaller and medium sized organizations  are  also  looking  forward  for  using  cloud services. The emerging 
demand for cloud services is driven by continuing globalization, consumer acceptance of technology, economic   
downturn   and   the   growth   of   the   extended enterprise. Cloud Computing [8] enables many organizations 
to  limit  the  large  capital  investment  that  is  associated  with  costly  data  centers  and  for  the  applications  and 
transforming these costs into operating expenses paying for cloud resources only as required. Moreover, using 
the cloud services enables the end users to speed up tome to market since it uses pre-existing virtual technology 
and infrastructure that can be delivered and used globally. 

 
So  basically  cloud    computing  is  combination    of  very    well-known  and  existing  technologies  that  were 
available is the early 1990s i.e. grid computing, utility computing and virtualization. Each of these technologies 
form the  essential  component in the  layers  of  cloud  computing,  which allows  the  end  users  to  pay  only  what 
resources they have used. 

  
In today market many cloud providers are available, choosing an optimal cloud provider has always  been a 
challenge for an organization  which  is  looking  for  implementing  cloud   or using its services. Organization 
should understand on what factors a specific cloud provider should be opted. Understanding requirements first

A.  Comparing of OpenStack with Eucalyptus and Open Nebula [11] 

There  are  also  comparative  studies  of  different  solutions.  It  is  essentially  an  overview  of  the  solutions 
Eucalyptus,  OpenNebula  and  a  presentation  of  their  different  characteristics.  In,  comparative  studies  of 
Eucalyptus and OpenNebula including architectures, features, characteristics, architectures and applications are 
done  in  order  to  provide  more  freedom  of  choice  for  the  users  of  the  cloud.  Different  solutions  exist  for  the 
deployment  of  open  source  clouds.  Among  these,  we  have  Eucalyptus,  OpenStack  and  OpenNebula.    We  
propose  a  comparative  study  of  the  last three solutions in order to select the most appropriate solution to our 
criteria. These include popularity, community use, modularity, openness, open source. Figures 2 and 3 show a 
comparison of the solutions using Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and OpenStack in all countries between April 2010 
and April 2012 and the interest of some countries to these solutions.

B.  Comparing Rackspace (OpenStack with Amazon Cloud Services) 

There  has  been  always  a  competition  between  these  two  cloud  providers.  In  the  following  part  we  will  be 
comparing  the  both  cloud  providers  in  detail.  Rackspace  greatest  asset  is  OpenStack.  Rackspace  provides  a 
superb Support whereas Amazon is not very good known for its customer Support. Amazon always tries to keep 
power on but if the power goes off, the user is in dark until Amazon restores its services. Both the Amazon and 
Windows Azure don‟t have strong reputations in terms of customer support. It doesn‟t matter  how  small  or  
large  business  is,  Rackspace support phone picks up quickly. The operators of Rack Space route the customers 
to experts who easily understand and troubleshoot network, storage, computer, database and other cloud issues. 
Rackspace  also  has  an  advantage  over  others  that  the  users  using  Rackspace  with  OpenStack  can  easily 
implement   a   flexible,   scalable   and   reliable   solution. OpenStack  means  that  the  cloud  will  be  flexible  
and  will attract more and more customers to keep them away from AWS. 

 
Rackspace‟s  has  a  very  simple  interface  as  compared  with  one  of  AWS.  User‟s  request  for  server  like 
Ubuntu 12.10, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB disk will only take minutes to get ready which on other hand on EC2 is bit 
more  difficult.  But  EC2  offers  one  good  option  that  users  can  either  selects  a  classic  or  quick  wizard  for 
launching the instance. 

  

Both  Rackspace  and  AWS provide  a  browser-based  terminal  connection.  For  connecting to  Rackspace  server, 
user can user iTerm, or SSH compatible terminal. Then user has to ping his server and then it will connect to the 
server using username and password provided to user. It only takes about 15 minutes. But in case of EC2 server, 
it  seems  to  be  much  more  complex  For  EC2  user  has  to  download  a  keypair  for  SSH  and  after  that  maze  of 
options from Amazon, it connects to server. 

 

IV. INSTALLING OPENSTACK USING DEVSTACK AND TRYSTACK 

In this  section  we  will  explain  the  steps the installing  private  cloud  using  Devstack  [13].  If  you  are  lack  of 
resources and still want to learn cloud practically,   then   Devstack  is   the  best  option   available. Devstack 
can be installed on your laptop and you can easily experience cloud environment within some hours. Now I will 
be discussing all the steps required to install Devstack on your local machine. 

 
i.     Add a user to install Devstack. Adduser stack 
ii.    Give sudo privileges to this user stack. To do this, edit the sudoers.sh file and all the following command 
at last of sudoers.sh file 
stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 
iii.   From here on you should use the Stack user you created. 
iv.   Download Devstack 
sudo apt-get install git -y || yum install -y git

git clone git://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git cd Devstack 
v.     Run Devstack 
Now to configure stack.sh. Devstack includes a sample in devstack/samples/localrc. Create localrc as shown 
below : 
FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.1.224/27 
FIXED_RANGE=10.11.12.0/24 
FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE=256 
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth0 
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret  
MYSQL_PASSWORD=iheartdatabase  
RABBIT_PASSWORD=flopsymopsy  
SERVICE_PASSWORD=iheartksl 
vi.   Run Devstack: 
./stack.sh 
At  this  point  Devstack  is  installed  on  your  machine.  Now  you  can  open  localhost  on  your  browser  and 
OpenStack  Dashboard  will  be  opened.  Just  login  with  the  credentials  of  username  “admin”  and  password 
“admin”.

After this you can create the keypair, by clicking on access and security tab in the dashboard and download it. 
Devstack comes up with a default image of cirros operating system. Click on Image tab and launch the instance. 
Give the instance name and then click on launch. Once the instance is launched, run the image in console and 
Open your Ubuntu terminal. Add the keypair from terminal and then simply by using ssh command connect to 
the instance created via dashboard. Your ubuntu terminal will be connected to the cirros instance that is created 
by Devstack. 

 
Launch the instance with secure connection. 
 
Steps to SSH into an instance by  using the keypair that was recently downloaded. 
1. Download the MyKey.pem file from the OpenStack Dashboard. 
2. In a command line interface, modify the access to the .pem file: 
$ chmod 0600 MyKey.pem 
3. Use the ssh-add command to ensure that the keypair is known to SSH: 
$ ssh-add MyKey.pem 
4. Copy the IP address from the MyFirstInstance. 
5. Use the SSH command to make a secure connection to the instance: 
$ ssh -i MyKey.pem ubuntu@10.0.0.2 
You should see a prompt asking "Are you sure you want no)?" Type yes and you have successfully connected. 
Once you type yes, you will experience cloud IaaS that you created by OpenStack Dashboard. Now you can 
install  whatever  software  you  want  to  use  on  the  cloud  and  then  can  connect  the  cloud  machine  to  other 
machines  connected  on  the  network.  You  can  experience  services  of  cloud  like  software  as  a  service  by

installing  software  on  cloud  instance  and  platform  as  a  service  also.  But  this  Devstack  is  just  for  trying  out 
OpenStack because every time you have to run ./stack.sh command which means all services will start again. 

 

Conclusions 

OpenStack  is  designed  to allow  researchers and  administrators  to deploy  IaaS  infrastructure and  provide  tools 
for  creating and managing  virtual machines  on top  of  existing resources.  This  work aims  to  illustrate  that the 
system OpenStack has filled  an  important  niche  in  the  design  space  of  cloud computing by providing an 
easy  to  deploy  over  the  existing  resources,  easy  to  use  in  experimentation  by  being  modular,  and      most  
importantly  forms   open   source  and   provides powerful features while following emerging open standards. 
Currently,  we  deployed  the  entire  system.  This  system  will  be  used  in  future  works  to  study  and  evaluate  its 
performances in dynamic reconfiguration in an IaaS Cloud Computing.
