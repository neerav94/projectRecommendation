Abstract 

Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this computing vision, of which the 
latest one is known as Cloud computing.  The term of cloud denotes the infrastructure as a 
“Cloud” from which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in 
the  world  on  demand.  Cloud  Computing  is  a  new  paradigm  for  the  provision  of  computing 
infrastructure,  and  provides  all  the  resources  including  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications, and services as a service. This paradigm shifts the location of this infrastructure 
to the network to reduce the costs associated with the management of hard-ware and software 
resources. This paper intends to provide comprehensive review on Cloud computing in terms 
standardization  in  de  jure  standardization  organizations  such  as  ITU-T  and  JTC1,  and  de 
facto standardization organizations.

The followings are the key characteristics of Cloud computing [14].  

  Agility  improves  with  users  able  to  rapidly  and  inexpensively  re-provision 
technological infrastructure resources. The cost of overall computing is unchanged, 
however, and the providers will merely absorb up-front costs and spread costs over a 
longer period.  

  Cost  is  claimed  to  be  greatly  reduced  and  capital  expenditure  is  converted  to 
operational expenditure. This ostensibly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is 
typically provided by a third-party and does not need to be purchased for one-time or 
infrequent  intensive  computing  tasks.  Pricing  on  a  utility  computing  basis  is  fine-
grained  with  usage-based  options  and  fewer  IT  skills  are  required  for 
implementation (in-house). Some would argue that given the low cost of computing 
resources,  that  the  IT  burden  merely  shifts  the  cost  from  in-house  to  outsourced 
providers.  Furthermore,  any  cost  reduction  benefit  must  be  weighed  against  a 
corresponding loss of control, access and security risks.  

  Device  and  location  independence  enable  users  to  access  systems  using  a  web 
browser regardless of their location or what device they are using (e.g., PC, mobile). 
As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the 
Internet, users can connect from anywhere.  

  Multi-tenancy  enables  sharing  of  resources  and  costs  across  a  large  pool  of  users 

thus allowing for:  

  Centralization  of  infrastructure  in  locations  with  lower  costs  (such  as  real 

estate, electricity, etc.)  

  Peak-load  capacity  increases  (users  need  not  engineer  for  highest  possible 

load-levels)  

  Utilization  and  efficiency  improvements  for  systems  that  are  often  only  10–

20% utilized.  

  Reliability improves through the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes cloud 
computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery. Nonetheless, many 
major  cloud  computing  services  have  suffered  outages,  and  IT  and  business 
managers can at times do little when they are affected.  

  Scalability via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, 
self-service  basis  near  real-time,  without  users  having  to  engineer  for  peak  loads. 
Performance  is  monitored  and  consistent  and  loosely-coupled  architectures  are 
constructed using web services as the system interface.  

  Security typically improves due to centralization of data, increased security-focused 
resources, etc.,  but  concerns  can  persist about loss  of  control  over certain sensitive 
data.  Security  is  often  as  good  as  or  better  than  under  traditional  systems,  in  part 
because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many 
customers  cannot  afford.  Providers  typically  log  accesses,  but  accessing  the  audit 
logs themselves can be difficult or impossible. Ownership, control and access to data 
controlled by "cloud" providers may be made more difficult, just as it is sometimes 
difficult  to  gain  access  to  "live"  support  with  current  utilities.  Under  the  cloud 
paradigm,  management  of  sensitive  data  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  cloud  providers 
and third parties.

ITU-T  Y.3501,  Cloud  Computing  Framework  and  high-level  requirements:  This 
Recommendation  provides  a  cloud  computing  framework  by  identifying  high-level 
requirements  for  cloud  computing.  The  Recommendation  addresses  the  general 
requirements and use cases for:  (i) cloud computing;, (ii) Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS),  Network  as  a  Service  (NaaS),  and  Desktop  as  a  Service  (DaaS)  cloud

 ITU-T  Y.3510,  Cloud  Computing 
Infrastructure  Requirements:  This 
Recommendation  identifies  requirements  for  cloud  infrastructure  capabilities  to 
support  cloud  services.  The  scope  of  this  Recommendation  includes:  overview  of 
cloud infrastructure, requirements for compute resources, requirements for network 
resources,  requirements  for  storage  resources,  and  requirements  for  resource 
abstraction  and  control.  Abstraction  and  control  of  physical  resources  are  essential 
means to achieve on-demand and elastic characteristics of cloud infrastructure.  

ITU-T  Y.3520, Cloud computing framework for end to end resource management: 
This  Recommendation  provides  a  framework  for  end-to-end  cloud  computing

delivery of cloud services. 

ITU-T Y.3511, Framework of inter-cloud computing for network and infrastructure: 
This  Recommendation  describes  the  framework  for  interactions  of  multiple  cloud 
service providers (CSPs) that is referred to as inter-cloud computing. Based on use 
cases  involving  several  CSPs  and  consideration  on  different  types  of  service 
offerings  (given  in  the  appendixes),  this  recommendation  describes  the  possible 
relationship  among  multiple  CSPs,  CSP  interactions,  and  relevant  functional 
requirements.  

ITU-T  X.1600,  Security  framework  for  cloud  computing:  This  Recommendation 
analyses  security  threats  and  challenges  in  the  cloud  computing  environment,  and 
describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and address security 
challenges.  A  framework  methodology  is  provided  for  determining  which  of  these 
security  capabilities  will  require  specification  for  mitigating  security  threats  and 
addressing security challenges for cloud computing.

1. Introduction 

With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
over the last half-century, and computing is being transformed to a model consisting of 
services that are commoditized and delivered in a manner. In such a model, users access 
services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or 
how  they  are  delivered.  Several  computing  paradigms  have  promised  to  deliver  this 
computing  vision,  of  which  the  latest  one  is  known  as  Cloud  computing.  The  term  of 
cloud denotes the infrastructure as a “Cloud” from which businesses and users are able 
to  access  applications  from  anywhere  in  the  world  on  demand.  Thus,  the  computing 
world is rapidly transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a 
service,  rather  than  to  run  on  their  individual  computers.  This  concept  is  known  as 
Cloud  computing,  and  it  represents  a  paradigm  shift  that  will  redefine  the  relationship 
between buyers and sellers of IT-related products and services. 

The  Cloud  is  drawing  the  attention  from  the  Information  and  Communication 
Technology  (ICT)  community,  thanks  to  the  appearance  of  a  set   of  services  with 
common characteristics, provided by important industry players. However, some of the 
existing  technologies  the  Cloud  concept  draws  on  (such  as  virtualization,   utility 
computing  or  distributed  computing)  are  not  new  [17].  The  term  cloud  is  used  as  a 
metaphor  for  the  Internet,  based  on  how  the  Internet  is  depicted  in  computer  network 
diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals [14].

The followings are the key characteristics of Cloud computing [14].  

  Agility  improves  with  users  able  to  rapidly  and  inexpensively  re-provision 
technological infrastructure resources. The cost of overall computing is unchanged, 
however, and the providers will merely absorb up-front costs and spread costs over a 
longer period.  

  Cost  is  claimed  to  be  greatly  reduced  and  capital  expenditure  is  converted  to 
operational expenditure. This ostensibly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is 
typically provided by a third-party and does not need to be purchased for one-time or 
infrequent  intensive  computing  tasks.  Pricing  on  a  utility  computing  basis  is  fine-
grained  with  usage-based  options  and  fewer  IT  skills  are  required  for 
implementation (in-house). Some would argue that given the low cost of computing 
resources,  that  the  IT  burden  merely  shifts  the  cost  from  in-house  to  outsourced 
providers.  Furthermore,  any  cost  reduction  benefit  must  be  weighed  against  a 
corresponding loss of control, access and security risks.  

  Device  and  location  independence  enable  users  to  access  systems  using  a  web 
browser regardless of their location or what device they are using (e.g., PC, mobile). 
As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the 
Internet, users can connect from anywhere.  

  Multi-tenancy  enables  sharing  of  resources  and  costs  across  a  large  pool  of  users 

thus allowing for:  

  Centralization  of  infrastructure  in  locations  with  lower  costs  (such  as  real 

estate, electricity, etc.)  

  Peak-load  capacity  increases  (users  need  not  engineer  for  highest  possible 

load-levels)  

  Utilization  and  efficiency  improvements  for  systems  that  are  often  only  10–

20% utilized.  

  Reliability improves through the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes cloud 
computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery. Nonetheless, many 
major  cloud  computing  services  have  suffered  outages,  and  IT  and  business 
managers can at times do little when they are affected.  

  Scalability via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, 
self-service  basis  near  real-time,  without  users  having  to  engineer  for  peak  loads. 
Performance  is  monitored  and  consistent  and  loosely-coupled  architectures  are 
constructed using web services as the system interface.  

  Security typically improves due to centralization of data, increased security-focused 
resources, etc.,  but  concerns  can  persist about loss  of  control  over certain sensitive 
data.  Security  is  often  as  good  as  or  better  than  under  traditional  systems,  in  part 
because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many 
customers  cannot  afford.  Providers  typically  log  accesses,  but  accessing  the  audit 
logs themselves can be difficult or impossible. Ownership, control and access to data 
controlled by "cloud" providers may be made more difficult, just as it is sometimes 
difficult  to  gain  access  to  "live"  support  with  current  utilities.  Under  the  cloud 
paradigm,  management  of  sensitive  data  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  cloud  providers 
and third parties.

6. De facto Standardization Organizations 
 
6.1. Open Grid Forum 

OGF is  an  open  community  committed  to  driving  the  rapid  evolution  and  adoption  of 
applied  distributed  computing,  and  the  purpose  of  this  group  is  the  creation  of  a  practical 
solution  to  interface  with  Cloud  infrastructures  exposed  as  a  service  (IaaS).  Applied 
Distributed Computing is critical to developing new, innovative and scalable applications and 
infrastructures  that  are  essential  to  productivity  in  the  enterprise  and  within  the  science 
community.  OGF  accomplishes  its  work  through  open  forums  that  build  the  community, 
explore trends, share best practices and consolidate these best practices into standards [12].  

The OGF is developing on an Open Cloud computing Interface (OCCI), which is an API 
for managing Cloud computing infrastructure. The purpose of  this group is the creation of a 
practical solution to interface with Cloud infrastructures exposed as a service (IaaS). They are 
focus  on  a  solution,  which  covers  the  provisioning,  monitoring  and  definition  of  Cloud 
Infrastructure  services.  The  group  should  create  this  API  in  an  agile  way  as  we  can  have 
advantages  over  other  groups  if  we  deliver  fast.  Overlapping  work  and  efforts  will  be 
contributed and synchronized with other groups.  
 
6.2. Cloud computing Interoperability Forum 

The Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF) [3] was formed in order to enable a 
global  cloud  computing  ecosystem  whereby  organizations  are  able  to  seamlessly  work 
together  for  the  purposes  for  wider  industry  adoption  of  cloud  computing  technology  and 
related  services.  A  key  focus  will  be  placed  on  the  creation  of  a  common  agreed  upon 
framework  /  ontology  that  enables  the  ability  of  two  or  more  cloud  platforms  to  exchange 
information in an unified manor.  

Unified  Cloud  Interfaces  and  API's  are  being  developed  by  the  CCIF  .  Unified  Cloud 
Computing is an attempt to create an open and standardized cloud interface for the unification 
of  various  cloud  API's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of  contact  that  can  encompass  the 
entire infrastructure stack as well as emerging cloud centric technologies all through a unified 
interface.  One of the key drivers of the unified cloud interface is to create an API about other 
api's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of contact  that  can  encompass  the entire infrastructure 
stack as well as emerging  cloud centric technologies all through a unified interface.   In this 
vision for a unified cloud interface the use of the resource description framework (RDF) is an 
ideal method to describe a semantic cloud data model (taxonomy & ontology). The benefit to 
an RDF based ontology languages is they act as general method for the conceptual description 
or modeling of information that is implemented by web resources. These web resources could 
just as easily be "cloud resources" or API's. This approach may also allow us to easily take an 
RDF  -based  cloud  data  model  and  use  it  within  other  ontology  languages  or  web  services 
making it both platform and vendor agnostic. Using this approach we're not so much defining 
how, but instead describing what. 
 
6.3. DMTF 

DMTF  [4]  is  also  working  on  virtualization  standards  in  the  Virtualization  Management 
Initiative  (VMAN).  In  a  press  release  the  Open  Virtualization  Format  standards  (OVF)  has 
been announced in March 2009.  “As part of the DMTF Virtualization Management Initiative 
(VMAN),  OVF  simplifies 
lifecycle 
management by describing an open, secure, portable, efficient and extensible format for the 
packaging  and  distribution  of  one  or  more  virtual  appliances  and  applications.  This  enables 

interoperability,  security  and  virtual  machine

The followings are the key characteristics of Cloud computing [14].  

  Agility  improves  with  users  able  to  rapidly  and  inexpensively  re-provision 
technological infrastructure resources. The cost of overall computing is unchanged, 
however, and the providers will merely absorb up-front costs and spread costs over a 
longer period.  

  Cost  is  claimed  to  be  greatly  reduced  and  capital  expenditure  is  converted  to 
operational expenditure. This ostensibly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is 
typically provided by a third-party and does not need to be purchased for one-time or 
infrequent  intensive  computing  tasks.  Pricing  on  a  utility  computing  basis  is  fine-
grained  with  usage-based  options  and  fewer  IT  skills  are  required  for 
implementation (in-house). Some would argue that given the low cost of computing 
resources,  that  the  IT  burden  merely  shifts  the  cost  from  in-house  to  outsourced 
providers.  Furthermore,  any  cost  reduction  benefit  must  be  weighed  against  a 
corresponding loss of control, access and security risks.  

  Device  and  location  independence  enable  users  to  access  systems  using  a  web 
browser regardless of their location or what device they are using (e.g., PC, mobile). 
As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the 
Internet, users can connect from anywhere.  

  Multi-tenancy  enables  sharing  of  resources  and  costs  across  a  large  pool  of  users 

thus allowing for:  

  Centralization  of  infrastructure  in  locations  with  lower  costs  (such  as  real 

estate, electricity, etc.)  

  Peak-load  capacity  increases  (users  need  not  engineer  for  highest  possible 

load-levels)  

  Utilization  and  efficiency  improvements  for  systems  that  are  often  only  10–

20% utilized.  

  Reliability improves through the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes cloud 
computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery. Nonetheless, many 
major  cloud  computing  services  have  suffered  outages,  and  IT  and  business 
managers can at times do little when they are affected.  

  Scalability via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, 
self-service  basis  near  real-time,  without  users  having  to  engineer  for  peak  loads. 
Performance  is  monitored  and  consistent  and  loosely-coupled  architectures  are 
constructed using web services as the system interface.  

  Security typically improves due to centralization of data, increased security-focused 
resources, etc.,  but  concerns  can  persist about loss  of  control  over certain sensitive 
data.  Security  is  often  as  good  as  or  better  than  under  traditional  systems,  in  part 
because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many 
customers  cannot  afford.  Providers  typically  log  accesses,  but  accessing  the  audit 
logs themselves can be difficult or impossible. Ownership, control and access to data 
controlled by "cloud" providers may be made more difficult, just as it is sometimes 
difficult  to  gain  access  to  "live"  support  with  current  utilities.  Under  the  cloud 
paradigm,  management  of  sensitive  data  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  cloud  providers 
and third parties.

ITU  (International  Telecommunication  Union)  is  the  United  Nations  specialized 
agency  for  information  and  communication  technologies  –  ICTs.  ITU-T  studied  on 
cloud  computing  from  the  FG  Cloud  (Focus  group  on  cloud  computing),  and  it  was 
decided  that  SG13  will  lead  the  cloud  computing  standardization  activity,  and  SG17 
will  cover  the  cloud  security.  The  following  ITU-T  Recommendations  are  developed, 
and it will be expanded for the cloud computing standards.

ITU-T  Y.3501,  Cloud  Computing  Framework  and  high-level  requirements:  This 
Recommendation  provides  a  cloud  computing  framework  by  identifying  high-level 
requirements  for  cloud  computing.  The  Recommendation  addresses  the  general 
requirements and use cases for:  (i) cloud computing;, (ii) Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS),  Network  as  a  Service  (NaaS),  and  Desktop  as  a  Service  (DaaS)  cloud 
services;,  amd  (iii)  inter-cloud,  end-to-end  resource  management,  and  cloud 
infrastructure.  

 ITU-T  Y.3510,  Cloud  Computing 
Infrastructure  Requirements:  This 
Recommendation  identifies  requirements  for  cloud  infrastructure  capabilities  to 
support  cloud  services.  The  scope  of  this  Recommendation  includes:  overview  of 
cloud infrastructure, requirements for compute resources, requirements for network 
resources,  requirements  for  storage  resources,  and  requirements  for  resource 
abstraction  and  control.  Abstraction  and  control  of  physical  resources  are  essential 
means to achieve on-demand and elastic characteristics of cloud infrastructure.  

ITU-T  Y.3520, Cloud computing framework for end to end resource management: 
This  Recommendation  provides  a  framework  for  end-to-end  cloud  computing 
resource management. This Recommendation includes (i) general concepts of end to 
end  cloud  computing  resource  management,  (ii)a  vision  for  adoption  of  cloud 
computing  resource  management  in  a  telecommunication  rich  environment,  and 
(iii)end-to-end  management  of  cloud  resource  and  services  across  multiple 
platforms,  i.e.  management  of  any  hardware  and  software  used  in  support  of  the 
delivery of cloud services. 

ITU-T Y.3511, Framework of inter-cloud computing for network and infrastructure: 
This  Recommendation  describes  the  framework  for  interactions  of  multiple  cloud 
service providers (CSPs) that is referred to as inter-cloud computing. Based on use 
cases  involving  several  CSPs  and  consideration  on  different  types  of  service 
offerings  (given  in  the  appendixes),  this  recommendation  describes  the  possible

4. Collaborative Teams between ITU-T SG13 and JTC 1 SC 38 

The  Collaborative  Teams  on  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and  Vocabulary  (CT-
CCVOCAB)  and  cloud  computing  reference  architecture  (CT-CCRA)  are  established  to 
collaboratively  develop  a  common  text  for  an  ITU-T  Recommendation 
|  ISO/IEC 
International  Standard  on  cloud  computing  overview  and  vocabulary,  and  cloud  computing 
reference architecture. The following items are main subject for this groups; 

 

 

ITU-T  Y.ccdef  |  ISO/IEC  17788,  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and  Vocabulary: 
This  Recommendation  |  International  Standard  provides  an  overview  of  cloud 
computing  along  with  a  set  of  terms,  definitions  and  concepts.  It  is  a  terminology 
foundation  for  the  cloud  computing  standardization  work.  This  Recommendation  | 
International  Standard  is  applicable  to  all  types  of  organization  (e.g.,  commercial 
enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations). 

ITU-T  Y.ccra  |  ISO/IEC  17789,  Cloud  Computing  Reference  Architecture:  This 
International  Standard|Recommendation  specifies  the  cloud  computing  reference

of  Cloud  Computing, 

characteristics 

 

5. JTC 1 SC 38 

Within  ISO  and  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC),  joint  technical 
committee  ISO/IEC  JTC  1,  Information  technology,  subcommittee  SC  38,  Distributed 
application platforms and services (DAPS), is active in this field, working on vocabulary and 
reference  architecture,  and  plans  further  standards  development  work  in  service  delivery, 
scenarios and use cases [1].  

After a study period, working group WG 3, Cloud computing, was formed within ISO/IEC 

JTC 1/SC 38, focusing on producing three deliverables: 

 

 

 

ISO/IEC  17788,  Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and 
Vocabulary: definitions of cloud terminology 

ISO/IEC  17789,  Cloud  Computing  Reference  Architecture:  an  architectural 
description of cloud computing’s major and general elements, actors and roles. 

Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  –  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA) 
Framework  and  Terminology  :  an  overview  of  SLAs  for  cloud  services, 
identification of the relationship between the master service agreement and the SLA, 
SLA  concepts  and  requirements  that  can  be  used  to  build  SLAs,  and  terms  and 
metrics commonly used in SLAs for cloud services. This standard is for the benefit 
and use for both provider and customer. This standard does not provide a standard 
structure  that  would  be  used  for  SLA  contracts.  Contracts  are  highly  customized 
items  between  providers  and  customers  so  this  standard  seeks  to  establish  a  set  of 
common SLA building blocks (concepts, terms, definitions, contexts) that can then 
be  used  to  create  SLAs  that  will  help  avoid  confusion  and  facilitate  common 
understanding  between  the  Cloud  Service  Providers  and  the  Cloud  Service 
Customers.  

These  three  deliverables  are  interrelated.  Many  of  the  terms  used  in  the  reference 

architecture and SLA refers to terms defined in the vocabulary.

6. De facto Standardization Organizations 
 
6.1. Open Grid Forum 

OGF is  an  open  community  committed  to  driving  the  rapid  evolution  and  adoption  of 
applied  distributed  computing,  and  the  purpose  of  this  group  is  the  creation  of  a  practical 
solution  to  interface  with  Cloud  infrastructures  exposed  as  a  service  (IaaS).  Applied 
Distributed Computing is critical to developing new, innovative and scalable applications and 
infrastructures  that  are  essential  to  productivity  in  the  enterprise  and  within  the  science 
community.  OGF  accomplishes  its  work  through  open  forums  that  build  the  community, 
explore trends, share best practices and consolidate these best practices into standards [12].  

The OGF is developing on an Open Cloud computing Interface (OCCI), which is an API 
for managing Cloud computing infrastructure. The purpose of  this group is the creation of a 
practical solution to interface with Cloud infrastructures exposed as a service (IaaS). They are 
focus  on  a  solution,  which  covers  the  provisioning,  monitoring  and  definition  of  Cloud 
Infrastructure  services.  The  group  should  create  this  API  in  an  agile  way  as  we  can  have 
advantages  over  other  groups  if  we  deliver  fast.  Overlapping  work  and  efforts  will  be 
contributed and synchronized with other groups.  
 
6.2. Cloud computing Interoperability Forum 

The Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF) [3] was formed in order to enable a 
global  cloud  computing  ecosystem  whereby  organizations  are  able  to  seamlessly  work 
together  for  the  purposes  for  wider  industry  adoption  of  cloud  computing  technology  and 
related  services.  A  key  focus  will  be  placed  on  the  creation  of  a  common  agreed  upon 
framework  /  ontology  that  enables  the  ability  of  two  or  more  cloud  platforms  to  exchange 
information in an unified manor.  

Unified  Cloud  Interfaces  and  API's  are  being  developed  by  the  CCIF  .  Unified  Cloud 
Computing is an attempt to create an open and standardized cloud interface for the unification 
of  various  cloud  API's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of  contact  that  can  encompass  the 
entire infrastructure stack as well as emerging cloud centric technologies all through a unified 
interface.  One of the key drivers of the unified cloud interface is to create an API about other 
api's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of contact  that  can  encompass  the entire infrastructure 
stack as well as emerging  cloud centric technologies all through a unified interface.   In this 
vision for a unified cloud interface the use of the resource description framework (RDF) is an 
ideal method to describe a semantic cloud data model (taxonomy & ontology). The benefit to 
an RDF based ontology languages is they act as general method for the conceptual description 
or modeling of information that is implemented by web resources. These web resources could 
just as easily be "cloud resources" or API's. This approach may also allow us to easily take an 
RDF  -based  cloud  data  model  and  use  it  within  other  ontology  languages  or  web  services 
making it both platform and vendor agnostic. Using this approach we're not so much defining 
how, but instead describing what. 
 
6.3. DMTF 

DMTF  [4]  is  also  working  on  virtualization  standards  in  the  Virtualization  Management 
Initiative  (VMAN).  In  a  press  release  the  Open  Virtualization  Format  standards  (OVF)  has 
been announced in March 2009.  “As part of the DMTF Virtualization Management Initiative 
(VMAN),  OVF  simplifies 
lifecycle 
management by describing an open, secure, portable, efficient and extensible format for the 
packaging  and  distribution  of  one  or  more  virtual  appliances  and  applications.  This  enables 

interoperability,  security  and  virtual  machine

software developers to ship pre-configured, ready-to-deploy solutions, allowing end-users to 
distribute  applications  into  their  environments  with  minimal  effort.  The  standard  can  also 
serve as a building block for Cloud computing.”   
 
6.4. Open Cloud Consortium 

The Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) [11] is a non-profit organization established and led 
by  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago  that  is  researching  the  creation  of  inter-cloud 
interfaces in the aim of developing compatibility standards. The goal of such standards is to 
allow  for  smooth  transitions  from  one  cloud  service  to  another.  The  OCC  is  continuing 
development with an eye to extensibility for the next generation of clouds, such as carrying 
out experiments with wide-area network clouds using not the widely employed TCP protocol 
for  communications,  but  rather  the  new  UDP-based  Data  Transfer  (UDT)  protocol  better 
suited to high-speed bulk data transfer. 
 
6.5. Cloud Security Alliance 

The Cloud Security Alliance [18] is a non-profit organization formed to promote the use of 
best  practices  for  providing  security  assurance  within  Cloud  computing,  and  provide 
education on the uses of Cloud computing to help secure all other forms of computing. 

The Cloud Security Alliance's objectives are to: 

  Promote a common level of understanding between the consumers and providers of 

cloud computing regarding the necessary security requirements and attestation of 
assurance. 

  Promote independent research into best practices for cloud computing security. 

  Launch awareness campaigns and educational programs on the appropriate uses of 

cloud computing and cloud security solutions. 

  Create consensus lists of issues and guidance for cloud security assurance. 

 
6.6. ETSI 

ETSI  [21]Technical  Committee  (TC)  GRID  is  updating  its  terms  of  reference  to  include 
the  emerging  commercial  trend  towards  Cloud  computing  which  places  particular  emphasis 
on ubiquitous network access to scalable computing and storage resources. Since TC GRID 
has  particular  interest  in  interoperable  solutions  in  situations  which  involve  contributions 
from  both the  IT  and  Telecom  industries, the emphasis is on the  Infrastructure as  a  Service 
(IaaS) delivery model. 
 
5. Conclusion 

Many  standardization  organizations  stepped  on  cloud  computing  with  their  own 
perspectives, and security and interoperability are the most mentione d cloud computing 
issues in each organization. In this paper, comprehensive review on Cloud computing in 
terms standardization in de jure standardization organizations such as ITU-T and JTC1, 
and de facto standardization organizations are provide. 

For  the  ultimate  interoperability  for  cloud  computing,  it  is  expected  that  more 
standards will be developed in each standardization organizations. Those activities will 
make rich environment for the information technology and computing infrastructure.

Abstract 

Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this computing vision, of which the 
latest one is known as Cloud computing.  The term of cloud denotes the infrastructure as a 
“Cloud” from which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in 
the  world  on  demand.  Cloud  Computing  is  a  new  paradigm  for  the  provision  of  computing 
infrastructure,  and  provides  all  the  resources  including  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications, and services as a service. This paradigm shifts the location of this infrastructure 
to the network to reduce the costs associated with the management of hard-ware and software 
resources. This paper intends to provide comprehensive review on Cloud computing in terms 
standardization  in  de  jure  standardization  organizations  such  as  ITU-T  and  JTC1,  and  de 
facto standardization organizations.

1. Introduction 

With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
over the last half-century, and computing is being transformed to a model consisting of 
services that are commoditized and delivered in a manner. In such a model, users access 
services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or 
how  they  are  delivered.  Several  computing  paradigms  have  promised  to  deliver  this 
computing  vision,  of  which  the  latest  one  is  known  as  Cloud  computing.  The  term  of 
cloud denotes the infrastructure as a “Cloud” from which businesses and users are able 
to  access  applications  from  anywhere  in  the  world  on  demand.  Thus,  the  computing 
world is rapidly transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a 
service,  rather  than  to  run  on  their  individual  computers.  This  concept  is  known  as 
Cloud  computing,  and  it  represents  a  paradigm  shift  that  will  redefine  the  relationship 
between buyers and sellers of IT-related products and services. 

The  Cloud  is  drawing  the  attention  from  the  Information  and  Communication 
Technology  (ICT)  community,  thanks  to  the  appearance  of  a  set   of  services  with 
common characteristics, provided by important industry players. However, some of the 
existing  technologies  the  Cloud  concept  draws  on  (such  as  virtualization,   utility 
computing  or  distributed  computing)  are  not  new  [17].  The  term  cloud  is  used  as  a 
metaphor  for  the  Internet,  based  on  how  the  Internet  is  depicted  in  computer  network 
diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals [14].

4. Collaborative Teams between ITU-T SG13 and JTC 1 SC 38 

The  Collaborative  Teams  on  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and  Vocabulary  (CT-
CCVOCAB)  and  cloud  computing  reference  architecture  (CT-CCRA)  are  established  to 
collaboratively  develop  a  common  text  for  an  ITU-T  Recommendation 
|  ISO/IEC 
International  Standard  on  cloud  computing  overview  and  vocabulary,  and  cloud  computing 
reference architecture. The following items are main subject for this groups; 

 

 

ITU-T  Y.ccdef  |  ISO/IEC  17788,  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and  Vocabulary: 
This  Recommendation  |  International  Standard  provides  an  overview  of  cloud 
computing  along  with  a  set  of  terms,  definitions  and  concepts.  It  is  a  terminology 
foundation  for  the  cloud  computing  standardization  work.  This  Recommendation  | 
International  Standard  is  applicable  to  all  types  of  organization  (e.g.,  commercial 
enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations). 

ITU-T  Y.ccra  |  ISO/IEC  17789,  Cloud  Computing  Reference  Architecture:  This 
International  Standard|Recommendation  specifies  the  cloud  computing  reference 
architecture. The reference architecture includes an overview of the general concepts 
and 
the  Cloud  Computing 
components|functions and roles and their capabilities and inter-relationships 

of  Cloud  Computing, 

characteristics 

 

5. JTC 1 SC 38 

Within  ISO  and  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC),  joint  technical 
committee  ISO/IEC  JTC  1,  Information  technology,  subcommittee  SC  38,  Distributed 
application platforms and services (DAPS), is active in this field, working on vocabulary and 
reference  architecture,  and  plans  further  standards  development  work  in  service  delivery, 
scenarios and use cases [1].  

After a study period, working group WG 3, Cloud computing, was formed within ISO/IEC 

JTC 1/SC 38, focusing on producing three deliverables: 

 

 

 

ISO/IEC  17788,  Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and 
Vocabulary: definitions of cloud terminology 

ISO/IEC  17789,  Cloud  Computing  Reference  Architecture:  an  architectural 
description of cloud computing’s major and general elements, actors and roles. 

Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  –  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA) 
Framework  and  Terminology  :  an  overview  of  SLAs  for  cloud  services, 
identification of the relationship between the master service agreement and the SLA, 
SLA  concepts  and  requirements  that  can  be  used  to  build  SLAs,  and  terms  and 
metrics commonly used in SLAs for cloud services. This standard is for the benefit 
and use for both provider and customer. This standard does not provide a standard 
structure  that  would  be  used  for  SLA  contracts.  Contracts  are  highly  customized 
items  between  providers  and  customers  so  this  standard  seeks  to  establish  a  set  of 
common SLA building blocks (concepts, terms, definitions, contexts) that can then 
be  used  to  create  SLAs  that  will  help  avoid  confusion  and  facilitate  common 
understanding  between  the  Cloud  Service  Providers  and  the  Cloud  Service 
Customers.  

These  three  deliverables  are  interrelated.  Many  of  the  terms  used  in  the  reference 

architecture and SLA refers to terms defined in the vocabulary.

6. De facto Standardization Organizations 
 
6.1. Open Grid Forum 

OGF is  an  open  community  committed  to  driving  the  rapid  evolution  and  adoption  of 
applied  distributed  computing,  and  the  purpose  of  this  group  is  the  creation  of  a  practical 
solution  to  interface  with  Cloud  infrastructures  exposed  as  a  service  (IaaS).  Applied 
Distributed Computing is critical to developing new, innovative and scalable applications and 
infrastructures  that  are  essential  to  productivity  in  the  enterprise  and  within  the  science 
community.  OGF  accomplishes  its  work  through  open  forums  that  build  the  community, 
explore trends, share best practices and consolidate these best practices into standards [12].  

The OGF is developing on an Open Cloud computing Interface (OCCI), which is an API 
for managing Cloud computing infrastructure. The purpose of  this group is the creation of a 
practical solution to interface with Cloud infrastructures exposed as a service (IaaS). They are 
focus  on  a  solution,  which  covers  the  provisioning,  monitoring  and  definition  of  Cloud 
Infrastructure  services.  The  group  should  create  this  API  in  an  agile  way  as  we  can  have 
advantages  over  other  groups  if  we  deliver  fast.  Overlapping  work  and  efforts  will  be 
contributed and synchronized with other groups.  
 
6.2. Cloud computing Interoperability Forum 

The Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF) [3] was formed in order to enable a 
global  cloud  computing  ecosystem  whereby  organizations  are  able  to  seamlessly  work 
together  for  the  purposes  for  wider  industry  adoption  of  cloud  computing  technology  and 
related  services.  A  key  focus  will  be  placed  on  the  creation  of  a  common  agreed  upon 
framework  /  ontology  that  enables  the  ability  of  two  or  more  cloud  platforms  to  exchange 
information in an unified manor.  

Unified  Cloud  Interfaces  and  API's  are  being  developed  by  the  CCIF  .  Unified  Cloud 
Computing is an attempt to create an open and standardized cloud interface for the unification 
of  various  cloud  API's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of  contact  that  can  encompass  the 
entire infrastructure stack as well as emerging cloud centric technologies all through a unified 
interface.  One of the key drivers of the unified cloud interface is to create an API about other 
api's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of contact  that  can  encompass  the entire infrastructure 
stack as well as emerging  cloud centric technologies all through a unified interface.   In this 
vision for a unified cloud interface the use of the resource description framework (RDF) is an 
ideal method to describe a semantic cloud data model (taxonomy & ontology). The benefit to 
an RDF based ontology languages is they act as general method for the conceptual description 
or modeling of information that is implemented by web resources. These web resources could 
just as easily be "cloud resources" or API's. This approach may also allow us to easily take an 
RDF  -based  cloud  data  model  and  use  it  within  other  ontology  languages  or  web  services 
making it both platform and vendor agnostic. Using this approach we're not so much defining 
how, but instead describing what. 
 
6.3. DMTF 

DMTF  [4]  is  also  working  on  virtualization  standards  in  the  Virtualization  Management 
Initiative  (VMAN).  In  a  press  release  the  Open  Virtualization  Format  standards  (OVF)  has 
been announced in March 2009.  “As part of the DMTF Virtualization Management Initiative 
(VMAN),  OVF  simplifies 
lifecycle 
management by describing an open, secure, portable, efficient and extensible format for the 
packaging  and  distribution  of  one  or  more  virtual  appliances  and  applications.  This  enables 

interoperability,  security  and  virtual  machine

software developers to ship pre-configured, ready-to-deploy solutions, allowing end-users to 
distribute  applications  into  their  environments  with  minimal  effort.  The  standard  can  also 
serve as a building block for Cloud computing.”   
 
6.4. Open Cloud Consortium 

The Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) [11] is a non-profit organization established and led 
by  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago  that  is  researching  the  creation  of  inter-cloud 
interfaces in the aim of developing compatibility standards. The goal of such standards is to 
allow  for  smooth  transitions  from  one  cloud  service  to  another.  The  OCC  is  continuing 
development with an eye to extensibility for the next generation of clouds, such as carrying 
out experiments with wide-area network clouds using not the widely employed TCP protocol 
for  communications,  but  rather  the  new  UDP-based  Data  Transfer  (UDT)  protocol  better 
suited to high-speed bulk data transfer. 
 
6.5. Cloud Security Alliance 

The Cloud Security Alliance [18] is a non-profit organization formed to promote the use of 
best  practices  for  providing  security  assurance  within  Cloud  computing,  and  provide 
education on the uses of Cloud computing to help secure all other forms of computing. 

The Cloud Security Alliance's objectives are to: 

  Promote a common level of understanding between the consumers and providers of 

cloud computing regarding the necessary security requirements and attestation of 
assurance. 

  Promote independent research into best practices for cloud computing security. 

  Launch awareness campaigns and educational programs on the appropriate uses of 

cloud computing and cloud security solutions. 

  Create consensus lists of issues and guidance for cloud security assurance. 

 
6.6. ETSI 

ETSI  [21]Technical  Committee  (TC)  GRID  is  updating  its  terms  of  reference  to  include 
the  emerging  commercial  trend  towards  Cloud  computing  which  places  particular  emphasis 
on ubiquitous network access to scalable computing and storage resources. Since TC GRID 
has  particular  interest  in  interoperable  solutions  in  situations  which  involve  contributions 
from  both the  IT  and  Telecom  industries, the emphasis is on the  Infrastructure as  a  Service 
(IaaS) delivery model. 
 
5. Conclusion 

Many  standardization  organizations  stepped  on  cloud  computing  with  their  own 
perspectives, and security and interoperability are the most mentione d cloud computing 
issues in each organization. In this paper, comprehensive review on Cloud computing in 
terms standardization in de jure standardization organizations such as ITU-T and JTC1, 
and de facto standardization organizations are provide. 

For  the  ultimate  interoperability  for  cloud  computing,  it  is  expected  that  more 
standards will be developed in each standardization organizations. Those activities will 
make rich environment for the information technology and computing infrastructure.

Abstract 

Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this computing vision, of which the 
latest one is known as Cloud computing.  The term of cloud denotes the infrastructure as a 
“Cloud” from which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in 
the  world  on  demand.  Cloud  Computing  is  a  new  paradigm  for  the  provision  of  computing 
infrastructure,  and  provides  all  the  resources  including  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications, and services as a service. This paradigm shifts the location of this infrastructure 
to the network to reduce the costs associated with the management of hard-ware and software 
resources. This paper intends to provide comprehensive review on Cloud computing in terms 
standardization  in  de  jure  standardization  organizations  such  as  ITU-T  and  JTC1,  and  de 
facto standardization organizations.

1. Introduction 

With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
over the last half-century, and computing is being transformed to a model consisting of 
services that are commoditized and delivered in a manner. In such a model, users access 
services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or 
how  they  are  delivered.  Several  computing  paradigms  have  promised  to  deliver  this 
computing  vision,  of  which  the  latest  one  is  known  as  Cloud  computing.  The  term  of 
cloud denotes the infrastructure as a “Cloud” from which businesses and users are able 
to  access  applications  from  anywhere  in  the  world  on  demand.  Thus,  the  computing 
world is rapidly transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a 
service,  rather  than  to  run  on  their  individual  computers.  This  concept  is  known  as 
Cloud  computing,  and  it  represents  a  paradigm  shift  that  will  redefine  the  relationship 
between buyers and sellers of IT-related products and services. 

The  Cloud  is  drawing  the  attention  from  the  Information  and  Communication 
Technology  (ICT)  community,  thanks  to  the  appearance  of  a  set   of  services  with 
common characteristics, provided by important industry players. However, some of the 
existing  technologies  the  Cloud  concept  draws  on  (such  as  virtualization,   utility 
computing  or  distributed  computing)  are  not  new  [17].  The  term  cloud  is  used  as  a 
metaphor  for  the  Internet,  based  on  how  the  Internet  is  depicted  in  computer  network 
diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals [14].

The followings are the key characteristics of Cloud computing [14].  

  Agility  improves  with  users  able  to  rapidly  and  inexpensively  re-provision 
technological infrastructure resources. The cost of overall computing is unchanged, 
however, and the providers will merely absorb up-front costs and spread costs over a 
longer period.  

  Cost  is  claimed  to  be  greatly  reduced  and  capital  expenditure  is  converted  to 
operational expenditure. This ostensibly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is 
typically provided by a third-party and does not need to be purchased for one-time or 
infrequent  intensive  computing  tasks.  Pricing  on  a  utility  computing  basis  is  fine-
grained  with  usage-based  options  and  fewer  IT  skills  are  required  for 
implementation (in-house). Some would argue that given the low cost of computing 
resources,  that  the  IT  burden  merely  shifts  the  cost  from  in-house  to  outsourced 
providers.  Furthermore,  any  cost  reduction  benefit  must  be  weighed  against  a 
corresponding loss of control, access and security risks.  

  Device  and  location  independence  enable  users  to  access  systems  using  a  web 
browser regardless of their location or what device they are using (e.g., PC, mobile). 
As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the 
Internet, users can connect from anywhere.  

  Multi-tenancy  enables  sharing  of  resources  and  costs  across  a  large  pool  of  users 

thus allowing for:  

  Centralization  of  infrastructure  in  locations  with  lower  costs  (such  as  real 

estate, electricity, etc.)  

  Peak-load  capacity  increases  (users  need  not  engineer  for  highest  possible 

load-levels)  

  Utilization  and  efficiency  improvements  for  systems  that  are  often  only  10–

20% utilized.  

  Reliability improves through the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes cloud 
computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery. Nonetheless, many 
major  cloud  computing  services  have  suffered  outages,  and  IT  and  business 
managers can at times do little when they are affected.  

  Scalability via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, 
self-service  basis  near  real-time,  without  users  having  to  engineer  for  peak  loads. 
Performance  is  monitored  and  consistent  and  loosely-coupled  architectures  are 
constructed using web services as the system interface.  

  Security typically improves due to centralization of data, increased security-focused 
resources, etc.,  but  concerns  can  persist about loss  of  control  over certain sensitive 
data.  Security  is  often  as  good  as  or  better  than  under  traditional  systems,  in  part 
because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many 
customers  cannot  afford.  Providers  typically  log  accesses,  but  accessing  the  audit 
logs themselves can be difficult or impossible. Ownership, control and access to data 
controlled by "cloud" providers may be made more difficult, just as it is sometimes 
difficult  to  gain  access  to  "live"  support  with  current  utilities.  Under  the  cloud 
paradigm,  management  of  sensitive  data  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  cloud  providers 
and third parties.

3. ITU-T SG13 and SG17 

in 

ITU  (International  Telecommunication  Union)  is  the  United  Nations  specialized 
agency  for  information  and  communication  technologies  –  ICTs.  ITU-T  studied  on 
cloud  computing  from  the  FG  Cloud  (Focus  group  on  cloud  computing),  and  it  was 
decided  that  SG13  will  lead  the  cloud  computing  standardization  activity,  and  SG17 
will  cover  the  cloud  security.  The  following  ITU-T  Recommendations  are  developed, 
and it will be expanded for the cloud computing standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

ITU-T  Y.3501,  Cloud  Computing  Framework  and  high-level  requirements:  This 
Recommendation  provides  a  cloud  computing  framework  by  identifying  high-level 
requirements  for  cloud  computing.  The  Recommendation  addresses  the  general 
requirements and use cases for:  (i) cloud computing;, (ii) Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS),  Network  as  a  Service  (NaaS),  and  Desktop  as  a  Service  (DaaS)  cloud 
services;,  amd  (iii)  inter-cloud,  end-to-end  resource  management,  and  cloud 
infrastructure.  

 ITU-T  Y.3510,  Cloud  Computing 
Infrastructure  Requirements:  This 
Recommendation  identifies  requirements  for  cloud  infrastructure  capabilities  to 
support  cloud  services.  The  scope  of  this  Recommendation  includes:  overview  of 
cloud infrastructure, requirements for compute resources, requirements for network 
resources,  requirements  for  storage  resources,  and  requirements  for  resource 
abstraction  and  control.  Abstraction  and  control  of  physical  resources  are  essential 
means to achieve on-demand and elastic characteristics of cloud infrastructure.  

ITU-T  Y.3520, Cloud computing framework for end to end resource management: 
This  Recommendation  provides  a  framework  for  end-to-end  cloud  computing 
resource management. This Recommendation includes (i) general concepts of end to 
end  cloud  computing  resource  management,  (ii)a  vision  for  adoption  of  cloud 
computing  resource  management  in  a  telecommunication  rich  environment,  and 
(iii)end-to-end  management  of  cloud  resource  and  services  across  multiple 
platforms,  i.e.  management  of  any  hardware  and  software  used  in  support  of  the 
delivery of cloud services. 

ITU-T Y.3511, Framework of inter-cloud computing for network and infrastructure: 
This  Recommendation  describes  the  framework  for  interactions  of  multiple  cloud 
service providers (CSPs) that is referred to as inter-cloud computing. Based on use 
cases  involving  several  CSPs  and  consideration  on  different  types  of  service 
offerings  (given  in  the  appendixes),  this  recommendation  describes  the  possible 
relationship  among  multiple  CSPs,  CSP  interactions,  and  relevant  functional 
requirements.  

ITU-T  X.1600,  Security  framework  for  cloud  computing:  This  Recommendation 
analyses  security  threats  and  challenges  in  the  cloud  computing  environment,  and 
describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and address security 
challenges.  A  framework  methodology  is  provided  for  determining  which  of  these 
security  capabilities  will  require  specification  for  mitigating  security  threats  and 
addressing security challenges for cloud computing.

The  Collaborative  Teams  on  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and  Vocabulary  (CT-
CCVOCAB)  and  cloud  computing  reference  architecture  (CT-CCRA)  are  established  to 
collaboratively  develop  a  common  text  for  an  ITU-T  Recommendation 
|  ISO/IEC 
International  Standard  on  cloud  computing  overview  and  vocabulary,  and  cloud  computing 
reference architecture. The following items are main subject for this groups;

5. JTC 1 SC 38 

Within  ISO  and  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC),  joint  technical 
committee  ISO/IEC  JTC  1,  Information  technology,  subcommittee  SC  38,  Distributed 
application platforms and services (DAPS), is active in this field, working on vocabulary and 
reference  architecture,  and  plans  further  standards  development  work  in  service  delivery, 
scenarios and use cases [1].  

After a study period, working group WG 3, Cloud computing, was formed within ISO/IEC 

JTC 1/SC 38, focusing on producing three deliverables: 

 

 

 

ISO/IEC  17788,  Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  Overview  and 
Vocabulary: definitions of cloud terminology 

ISO/IEC  17789,  Cloud  Computing  Reference  Architecture:  an  architectural 
description of cloud computing’s major and general elements, actors and roles. 

Information  Technology  -  Cloud  Computing  –  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA) 
Framework  and  Terminology  :  an  overview  of  SLAs  for  cloud  services, 
identification of the relationship between the master service agreement and the SLA, 
SLA  concepts  and  requirements  that  can  be  used  to  build  SLAs,  and  terms  and 
metrics commonly used in SLAs for cloud services. This standard is for the benefit 
and use for both provider and customer. This standard does not provide a standard 
structure  that  would  be  used  for  SLA  contracts.  Contracts  are  highly  customized 
items  between  providers  and  customers  so  this  standard  seeks  to  establish  a  set  of 
common SLA building blocks (concepts, terms, definitions, contexts) that can then 
be  used  to  create  SLAs  that  will  help  avoid  confusion  and  facilitate  common 
understanding  between  the  Cloud  Service  Providers  and  the  Cloud  Service 
Customers.  

These  three  deliverables  are  interrelated.  Many  of  the  terms  used  in  the  reference 

architecture and SLA refers to terms defined in the vocabulary.

6. De facto Standardization Organizations 
 
6.1. Open Grid Forum 

OGF is  an  open  community  committed  to  driving  the  rapid  evolution  and  adoption  of 
applied  distributed  computing,  and  the  purpose  of  this  group  is  the  creation  of  a  practical 
solution  to  interface  with  Cloud  infrastructures  exposed  as  a  service  (IaaS).  Applied 
Distributed Computing is critical to developing new, innovative and scalable applications and 
infrastructures  that  are  essential  to  productivity  in  the  enterprise  and  within  the  science 
community.  OGF  accomplishes  its  work  through  open  forums  that  build  the  community, 
explore trends, share best practices and consolidate these best practices into standards [12].  

The OGF is developing on an Open Cloud computing Interface (OCCI), which is an API 
for managing Cloud computing infrastructure. The purpose of  this group is the creation of a 
practical solution to interface with Cloud infrastructures exposed as a service (IaaS). They are 
focus  on  a  solution,  which  covers  the  provisioning,  monitoring  and  definition  of  Cloud 
Infrastructure  services.  The  group  should  create  this  API  in  an  agile  way  as  we  can  have 
advantages  over  other  groups  if  we  deliver  fast.  Overlapping  work  and  efforts  will  be 
contributed and synchronized with other groups.  
 
6.2. Cloud computing Interoperability Forum 

The Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF) [3] was formed in order to enable a 
global  cloud  computing  ecosystem  whereby  organizations  are  able  to  seamlessly  work 
together  for  the  purposes  for  wider  industry  adoption  of  cloud  computing  technology  and 
related  services.  A  key  focus  will  be  placed  on  the  creation  of  a  common  agreed  upon 
framework  /  ontology  that  enables  the  ability  of  two  or  more  cloud  platforms  to  exchange 
information in an unified manor.  

Unified  Cloud  Interfaces  and  API's  are  being  developed  by  the  CCIF  .  Unified  Cloud 
Computing is an attempt to create an open and standardized cloud interface for the unification 
of  various  cloud  API's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of  contact  that  can  encompass  the 
entire infrastructure stack as well as emerging cloud centric technologies all through a unified 
interface.  One of the key drivers of the unified cloud interface is to create an API about other 
api's.  A  singular  programmatic  point  of contact  that  can  encompass  the entire infrastructure 
stack as well as emerging  cloud centric technologies all through a unified interface.   In this 
vision for a unified cloud interface the use of the resource description framework (RDF) is an 
ideal method to describe a semantic cloud data model (taxonomy & ontology). The benefit to 
an RDF based ontology languages is they act as general method for the conceptual description 
or modeling of information that is implemented by web resources. These web resources could 
just as easily be "cloud resources" or API's. This approach may also allow us to easily take an 
RDF  -based  cloud  data  model  and  use  it  within  other  ontology  languages  or  web  services 
making it both platform and vendor agnostic. Using this approach we're not so much defining 
how, but instead describing what. 
 
6.3. DMTF 

DMTF  [4]  is  also  working  on  virtualization  standards  in  the  Virtualization  Management 
Initiative  (VMAN).  In  a  press  release  the  Open  Virtualization  Format  standards  (OVF)  has 
been announced in March 2009.  “As part of the DMTF Virtualization Management Initiative 
(VMAN),  OVF  simplifies 
lifecycle 
management by describing an open, secure, portable, efficient and extensible format for the 
packaging  and  distribution  of  one  or  more  virtual  appliances  and  applications.  This  enables 

interoperability,  security  and  virtual  machine

software developers to ship pre-configured, ready-to-deploy solutions, allowing end-users to 
distribute  applications  into  their  environments  with  minimal  effort.  The  standard  can  also 
serve as a building block for Cloud computing.”   
 
6.4. Open Cloud Consortium 

The Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) [11] is a non-profit organization established and led 
by  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago  that  is  researching  the  creation  of  inter-cloud 
interfaces in the aim of developing compatibility standards. The goal of such standards is to 
allow  for  smooth  transitions  from  one  cloud  service  to  another.  The  OCC  is  continuing 
development with an eye to extensibility for the next generation of clouds, such as carrying 
out experiments with wide-area network clouds using not the widely employed TCP protocol 
for  communications,  but  rather  the  new  UDP-based  Data  Transfer  (UDT)  protocol  better 
suited to high-speed bulk data transfer. 
 
6.5. Cloud Security Alliance 

The Cloud Security Alliance [18] is a non-profit organization formed to promote the use of 
best  practices  for  providing  security  assurance  within  Cloud  computing,  and  provide 
education on the uses of Cloud computing to help secure all other forms of computing. 

The Cloud Security Alliance's objectives are to: 

  Promote a common level of understanding between the consumers and providers of 

cloud computing regarding the necessary security requirements and attestation of 
assurance. 

  Promote independent research into best practices for cloud computing security. 

  Launch awareness campaigns and educational programs on the appropriate uses of 

cloud computing and cloud security solutions. 

  Create consensus lists of issues and guidance for cloud security assurance. 

 
6.6. ETSI 

ETSI  [21]Technical  Committee  (TC)  GRID  is  updating  its  terms  of  reference  to  include 
the  emerging  commercial  trend  towards  Cloud  computing  which  places  particular  emphasis 
on ubiquitous network access to scalable computing and storage resources. Since TC GRID 
has  particular  interest  in  interoperable  solutions  in  situations  which  involve  contributions 
from  both the  IT  and  Telecom  industries, the emphasis is on the  Infrastructure as  a  Service 
(IaaS) delivery model. 
 
5. Conclusion 

Many  standardization  organizations  stepped  on  cloud  computing  with  their  own 
perspectives, and security and interoperability are the most mentione d cloud computing 
issues in each organization. In this paper, comprehensive review on Cloud computing in 
terms standardization in de jure standardization organizations such as ITU-T and JTC1, 
and de facto standardization organizations are provide. 

For  the  ultimate  interoperability  for  cloud  computing,  it  is  expected  that  more 
standards will be developed in each standardization organizations. Those activities will 
make rich environment for the information technology and computing infrastructure.
