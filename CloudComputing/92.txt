 Data Storage in Cloud 
In  cloud  storage  system,  companies  stores  their 
data  in  the  remotely  located  data  server.  Storage 
as  a  Service 
is  generally  seen  as  a  good 
alternative  for a small or  mid-sized business  that 
lacks 
technical 
personnel  to  implement  and  maintain  their  own 
storage  infrastructure.    Accordingly,  correctness 
of  the  data  is  assured.  Even  though  sometimes 
unauthorized  person  may  modify  or  delete  the 
data  which  leads  to  server  compromise  and/or 
random Byzantine  failures. Because  it can be the 
first  step  for  fast  recovery  of  the  storage  errors. 
SaaS  is  also  being  promoted  as  a  way  for  all 
businesses  to  mitigate  risks  in  disaster  recovery, 
provide 
long-term  retention  for  records  and 
enhance both business continuity and availability. 
The  cloud  storage  systems  propose  an  effective 
and  flexible  distributed  scheme  with  explicit 
dynamic  data  support  for  file  distribution  across 
cloud  servers.  The  benefits  of  cloud  computing 
are  significant—economies  of  scale,  potential 
cost 
fast  deployment  and  easy 
scalability.  Data  storage  in  a  cloud  is  a  process 
where a user stores  his data through a CSP into a 
set  of  cloud  servers,  which  are 
running 
in  distributed 
concurrently,  cooperated  and 
manner.  Data  redundancy  can  be  employed  with 
technique  of  erasure-correcting  code  to  further 
tolerate faults or server crash as user’s data grows 
in 
for 
application  purposes,  the  user  interacts  with  the 
cloud  servers  via  CSP  to  access  or  retrieve  his 
data.  .  In  some  cases,  the  user  may  need  to 
perform  block  level  operations  on  his  data.  The 
most  general  forms  of  these  operations  we  are 
considering  are  block  revise,  erase,  insert  and 
affix.  
As users  no  longer possess their data  locally,  it  is 
of  critical  importance  to  assure  users  that  their 
data  are  being  correctly  stored  and  maintained. 
That  is,  users  should  be  prepared  with  security 
means  so 
they  can  make  continuous 
correctness  assurance  of  their  data  stored  in 

importance.  Thereafter,

CLOUD COMPUTING MODEL 

 

1. Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) :   
Software  as  a  Service  provides  software  or 
application  which  can  be  used  over  the  internet 
and  user  does  not  have  not  aware  of  any 
information regarding operating  system, physical 
hardware.  
 This  type  of  application  can  be  access  via 

internet and through browser at user side.  

2. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) :   
Platform as a Service provide the setup of client’s 
software  packages  and  other  tools  which  set  up 
on service providers’ physical  hardware over the 
internet. So whole establishment  is take place on 
service  providers’  environment  and  user  can 
access  that  software  after  authentication  process 
passes  successfully.  This  user  can  free  from  the 
hardware 
this 
service.  
 
3. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) :   
In this type of cloud, user can  have whole  virtual 
server  and  user  can  access  it  as  he  can  access  it 
local like start, stop, and access and configure the 
server.  In this type of service,  user pays only  for 
the capacity and model he needs them.

application.  It  can  produce  various  applications 
supported  by  cloud,  and  one  cloud  can  support 
different applications running it at the same time. 
5. High extendibility 
The  scale  of  cloud  can  extend  dynamically  to 
meet the increasingly requirement. 
6. On demand service 
Cloud  is  a  large  resource  pool  that  you  can  buy 
according to  your  need; cloud  is just  like running 
water, electric, and gas that can be charged by the 
amount that you used. 
7. Extremely inexpensive 
Because the cloud’s special fault tolerance can be 
built  by  very  inexpensive  nodes,  the  centered 
management  of  cloud  make 
the  enterprise 
needn’t  undertake  the  management  cost  of  data 
center  that  increase  very  fast. The  versatility can 
increase  the  utilization  rate  of  the  available 
resources  compared  with  traditional  system,  so 
users can fully enjoy the low cost advantage. You 
can  spend  only  a  few  hundred  dollars  and  a  few 
days  to  accomplish  a  task  that  you  must  do  it 
spending thousands of dollars and several months 
before. 
 
 Cloud Computing Attacks 
As  more  companies  move  to  cloud  computing, 
look  for  hackers to  follow. Some of the potential 
attack vectors criminals may attempt include: 
a.  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  attacks:  Some 
security professionals  have argued that the cloud 
is  more  vulnerable  to  DoS  attacks,  because  it  is 
shared by  many  users, which  makes  DoS attacks 
much more damaging. 
b.  Side  Channel  attacks:  An  attacker  could 
attempt  to  compromise  the  cloud  by  placing  a 
malicious  virtual  machine  in close proximity  to a 
target  cloud  server  and  then  launching  a  side 
channel attack. 
c.  Authentication  attacks:  Authentication  is  a 
weak  point  in  hosted  and  virtual  services  and  is 
frequently 
targeted.  There  are  many  different  ways  to 
authenticate  users;  for example, based on what a 

peer-to-peer 

communication 

 
 
Cloud Servers even without the existence of local 
copies.  In  case  those  users  do  not  necessarily 
have  the  time,  feasibility or  resources to  monitor 
their  data,  they  can  delegate  the  tasks  to  an 
optional  trusted  Third  Party  Auditor  of  their 
respective choices. In our  model, we assume  that 
channels 
the 
between  each  cloud  server  and  the  user 
is 
authenticated and reliable, which can be achieved 
in  practice  with  little  overhead.  Companies  still 
think  long  and  hard  about  moving  applications 
and data to the cloud from traditional, on-premise 
computing  models,  and  many  are  hesitating  to 
move applications containing  sensitive data.  The 
benefits  of  cloud  computing  are  significant—
economies  of  scale,  potential  cost  savings,  fast 
deployment and easy scalability. 
 
 The characters of cloud computing 
1  Ultra  large-scale  The  scale  of  cloud  is  large. 
The  cloud  of  Google  has  owned  more  than  one 
million 
IBM, 
Microsoft, Yahoo, they  have  more than  hundreds 
of  thousands  servers.  There  are  hundreds  of 
servers  in an enterprise. Cloud enlarge the  user’s 
computing power. 
2. Virtualization 
Cloud  computing  makes  user  get  service 
anywhere,  through  any  kind  of  terminal.  The 
resources  it required come  from cloud  instead of 
visible  entity.  You  can  complete  all  you  want 
through  net  service  using  a  notebook  pc  or  a  
mobile phone.  Users can attain or share  it safely 
through  an  easy  way,  anytime,  anywhere.  Users 
can complete a  task  that can’t be  completed  in a 
single computer. 
3 High reliability 
Cloud uses data multi-transcript fault tolerant, the 
computation  node 
isomorphism  exchangeable 
and  so  on  to  ensure  the  high  reliability  of  the 
service.  Using  cloud  computing  is  more  reliable 
than local computer.  
4 Versatility 
Cloud computing doesn’t aim at certain special 

servers.  Even

 Data Storage in Cloud 
In  cloud  storage  system,  companies  stores  their 
data  in  the  remotely  located  data  server.  Storage 
as  a  Service 
is  generally  seen  as  a  good 
alternative  for a small or  mid-sized business  that 
lacks 
technical 
personnel  to  implement  and  maintain  their  own 
storage  infrastructure.    Accordingly,  correctness 
of  the  data  is  assured.  Even  though  sometimes 
unauthorized  person  may  modify  or  delete  the 
data  which  leads  to  server  compromise  and/or 
random Byzantine  failures. Because  it can be the 
first  step  for  fast  recovery  of  the  storage  errors. 
SaaS  is  also  being  promoted  as  a  way  for  all 
businesses  to  mitigate  risks  in  disaster  recovery, 
provide 
long-term  retention  for  records  and 
enhance both business continuity and availability. 
The  cloud  storage  systems  propose  an  effective 
and  flexible  distributed  scheme  with  explicit 
dynamic  data  support  for  file  distribution  across 
cloud  servers.  The  benefits  of  cloud  computing 
are  significant—economies  of  scale,  potential

where a user stores  his data through a CSP into a

perform  block  level  operations  on  his  data.  The 
most  general  forms  of  these  operations  we  are

As users  no  longer possess their data  locally,  it  is 
of  critical  importance  to  assure  users  that  their 
data  are  being  correctly  stored  and  maintained.

CLOUD COMPUTING MODEL 

 

1. Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) :   
Software  as  a  Service  provides  software  or 
application  which  can  be  used  over  the  internet 
and  user  does  not  have  not  aware  of  any 
information regarding operating  system, physical 
hardware.  
 This  type  of  application  can  be  access  via 

internet and through browser at user side.  

2. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) :   
Platform as a Service provide the setup of client’s 
software  packages  and  other  tools  which  set  up 
on service providers’ physical  hardware over the 
internet. So whole establishment  is take place on 
service  providers’  environment  and  user  can 
access  that  software  after  authentication  process 
passes  successfully.  This  user  can  free  from  the 
hardware 
this 
service.  
 
3. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) :   
In this type of cloud, user can  have whole  virtual 
server  and  user  can  access  it  as  he  can  access  it 
local like start, stop, and access and configure the 
server.  In this type of service,  user pays only  for 
the capacity and model he needs them.

application.  It  can  produce  various  applications 
supported  by  cloud,  and  one  cloud  can  support 
different applications running it at the same time. 
5. High extendibility 
The  scale  of  cloud  can  extend  dynamically  to 
meet the increasingly requirement. 
6. On demand service 
Cloud  is  a  large  resource  pool  that  you  can  buy 
according to  your  need; cloud  is just  like running 
water, electric, and gas that can be charged by the 
amount that you used. 
7. Extremely inexpensive 
Because the cloud’s special fault tolerance can be 
built  by  very  inexpensive  nodes,  the  centered 
management  of  cloud  make 
the  enterprise 
needn’t  undertake  the  management  cost  of  data 
center  that  increase  very  fast. The  versatility can 
increase  the  utilization  rate  of  the  available 
resources  compared  with  traditional  system,  so 
users can fully enjoy the low cost advantage. You 
can  spend  only  a  few  hundred  dollars  and  a  few 
days  to  accomplish  a  task  that  you  must  do  it 
spending thousands of dollars and several months 
before. 
 
 Cloud Computing Attacks 
As  more  companies  move  to  cloud  computing, 
look  for  hackers to  follow. Some of the potential 
attack vectors criminals may attempt include: 
a.  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  attacks:  Some 
security professionals  have argued that the cloud 
is  more  vulnerable  to  DoS  attacks,  because  it  is 
shared by  many  users, which  makes  DoS attacks 
much more damaging. 
b.  Side  Channel  attacks:  An  attacker  could 
attempt  to  compromise  the  cloud  by  placing  a 
malicious  virtual  machine  in close proximity  to a 
target  cloud  server  and  then  launching  a  side 
channel attack. 
c.  Authentication  attacks:  Authentication  is  a 
weak  point  in  hosted  and  virtual  services  and  is 
frequently 
targeted.  There  are  many  different  ways  to 
authenticate  users;  for example, based on what a 

peer-to-peer 

communication 

 
 
Cloud Servers even without the existence of local 
copies.  In  case  those  users  do  not  necessarily 
have  the  time,  feasibility or  resources to  monitor 
their  data,  they  can  delegate  the  tasks  to  an 
optional  trusted  Third  Party  Auditor  of  their 
respective choices. In our  model, we assume  that 
channels 
the 
between  each  cloud  server  and  the  user 
is 
authenticated and reliable, which can be achieved 
in  practice  with  little  overhead.  Companies  still 
think  long  and  hard  about  moving  applications 
and data to the cloud from traditional, on-premise 
computing  models,  and  many  are  hesitating  to 
move applications containing  sensitive data.  The 
benefits  of  cloud  computing  are  significant—
economies  of  scale,  potential  cost  savings,  fast 
deployment and easy scalability. 
 
 The characters of cloud computing 
1  Ultra  large-scale  The  scale  of  cloud  is  large. 
The  cloud  of  Google  has  owned  more  than  one 
million 
IBM, 
Microsoft, Yahoo, they  have  more than  hundreds 
of  thousands  servers.  There  are  hundreds  of 
servers  in an enterprise. Cloud enlarge the  user’s 
computing power. 
2. Virtualization 
Cloud  computing  makes  user  get  service 
anywhere,  through  any  kind  of  terminal.  The 
resources  it required come  from cloud  instead of 
visible  entity.  You  can  complete  all  you  want 
through  net  service  using  a  notebook  pc  or  a  
mobile phone.  Users can attain or share  it safely 
through  an  easy  way,  anytime,  anywhere.  Users 
can complete a  task  that can’t be  completed  in a 
single computer. 
3 High reliability 
Cloud uses data multi-transcript fault tolerant, the 
computation  node 
isomorphism  exchangeable 
and  so  on  to  ensure  the  high  reliability  of  the 
service.  Using  cloud  computing  is  more  reliable 
than local computer.  
4 Versatility 
Cloud computing doesn’t aim at certain special 

servers.  Even

identity 

is  when 

Authentication  is  the  process  of  verifying  a  user 
or other entity’s identity. This is typically done to 
permit  someone  or  something  to  perform  a  task. 
There  is  variety  of  authentication  system,  some 
are  stronger  than  others.  A  strong  authentication 
system  ensures 
the  authenticators  and 
messages of the actual authentication protocol are 
not  exchanged  in  a  manner  that  makes  them 
vulnerable  to  being  hijacked  by  an  intermediate 
malicious  node  or  person.  That 
the 
information  used  to  generate  a  proof  of  identity 
should  not  be  exposed  to  anyone  other  than  the 
person or machine it is intended for. 
Authorization: 
Authorization 
the  system  decides 
whether  or  not  a  certain  entity  be  allowed  to 
perform  a  requested  task.  This  decision  is  made 
after  authenticating 
in  question. 
When considering an authentication system  for a 
particular  application,  it  is  crucial  to  understand 
the type of identifier required to provide a certain 
level of authorization. 
Confidentiality: 
Confidentiality  is  needed  when  the  message sent 
contains  sensitive  material  that  should  not  be 
read by others and therefore must not be sent in a 
comprehensible  format.  A  loss  of  confidentiality 
is  the  unauthorized  disclosure  of  information. 
Confidentiality,  as  it  relates  to  security  and 
encryption 
techniques  can  be  obtained  by 
encrypting  messages  such  that  only  intended 
recipient are able to read them. 
Integrity: 
Integrity  is  ensuring  that  the  data  presented  are 
true  and  valid  master  source  of  the  data  and 
includes  guarding  against  improper  information 
modification or destruction to ensure  information 
non-repudiation  and  authenticity.  A 
loss  of 
integrity 
the  unauthorized  modification, 
insertion, or destruction of information. 
One way of ensuring of data  integrity  is by  using 
simple  checksums  which  prevent  an  attacker 
from forging or replaying messages. Checksum is 
usually  implemented  when  the  channel  between

person  knows,  has,  or  is.  The  mechanisms  used 
to  secure  the  authentication  process  and  the 
methods used are a frequent target of attackers. 
d.  Man-in-the-middle  cryptographic  attacks: 
This attack  is carried out when an attacker places 
himself  between  two  users.  Anytime  attackers 
can  place  themselves  in  the  communication’s 
path,  there

they  can

person, employee or staffs who  is knowledgeable 
of how the system runs, from client to server then 
he  can

everything in the cloud system. 
 
Security 
It  is  clear  that  the  security  issue  has  played  the 
most 
in  hindering  Cloud 
computing.  Without  doubt,putting  your  data, 
running  your  software  at  someone  else's  hard  
disk  using someone else's CPU appears daunting 
to many. 
Well-known  security  issues  such  as  data  loss, 
phishing,  botnet

collection  of  machines)  pose  serious  threats  to 
organization's  data  and 
software  Security 
measures  assumed  in  the  cloud  must  be  made 
available  to  the  customers  to  gain  their  trust. 
There  is  always  a  possibility  that  the  cloud 
infrastructure  is  secured  with  respect  to  some 
requirements and the customers are  looking  for a 
different  set  of  security.  In  order  to  have  a 
secured  Cloud  computing  deployment,  we  must 
consider 
the  cloud 
computing  architecture,  Governance,  portability 
and  interoperability, traditional security, business 
continuity  and  disaster  recovery,  data  center 
operations,  incident  response,  notification  and 
remediation,  Application  Security,  Encryption

of  thousands  servers.  There  are  hundreds  of 
servers  in an enterprise. Cloud enlarge the  user’s 
computing power. 
2. Virtualization 
Cloud  computing  makes  user  get  service 
anywhere,  through  any  kind  of  terminal.  The 
resources  it required come  from cloud  instead of 
visible  entity.  You  can  complete  all  you  want 
through  net  service  using  a  notebook  pc  or  a  
mobile phone.  Users can attain or share  it safely 
through  an  easy  way,  anytime,  anywhere.  Users 
can complete a  task  that can’t be  completed  in a 
single computer. 
3 High reliability 
Cloud uses data multi-transcript fault tolerant, the 
computation  node 
isomorphism  exchangeable 
and  so  on  to  ensure  the  high  reliability  of  the 
service.  Using  cloud  computing  is  more  reliable 
than local computer.  
4 Versatility 
Cloud computing doesn’t aim at certain special 

servers.  Even 

in  Amazon,

identity 

is  when 

Authentication  is  the  process  of  verifying  a  user 
or other entity’s identity. This is typically done to 
permit  someone  or  something  to  perform  a  task. 
There  is  variety  of  authentication  system,  some 
are  stronger  than  others.  A  strong  authentication 
system  ensures 
the  authenticators  and 
messages of the actual authentication protocol are 
not  exchanged  in  a  manner  that  makes  them 
vulnerable  to  being  hijacked  by  an  intermediate 
malicious  node  or  person.  That 
the 
information  used  to  generate  a  proof  of  identity 
should  not  be  exposed  to  anyone  other  than  the 
person or machine it is intended for. 
Authorization: 
Authorization 
the  system  decides 
whether  or  not  a  certain  entity  be  allowed  to 
perform  a  requested  task.  This  decision  is  made 
after  authenticating 
in  question. 
When considering an authentication system  for a 
particular  application,  it  is  crucial  to  understand 
the type of identifier required to provide a certain 
level of authorization. 
Confidentiality: 
Confidentiality  is  needed  when  the  message sent 
contains  sensitive  material  that  should  not  be 
read by others and therefore must not be sent in a 
comprehensible  format.  A  loss  of  confidentiality 
is  the  unauthorized  disclosure  of  information. 
Confidentiality,  as  it  relates  to  security  and 
encryption 
techniques  can  be  obtained  by 
encrypting  messages  such  that  only  intended 
recipient are able to read them. 
Integrity: 
Integrity  is  ensuring  that  the  data  presented  are 
true  and  valid  master  source  of  the  data  and 
includes  guarding  against  improper  information 
modification or destruction to ensure  information 
non-repudiation  and  authenticity.  A 
loss  of 
integrity 
the  unauthorized  modification, 
insertion, or destruction of information. 
One way of ensuring of data  integrity  is by  using 
simple  checksums  which  prevent  an  attacker 
from forging or replaying messages. Checksum is 
usually  implemented  when  the  channel  between

is  the  possibility

person  knows,  has,  or  is.  The  mechanisms  used 
to  secure  the  authentication  process  and  the 
methods used are a frequent target of attackers. 
d.  Man-in-the-middle  cryptographic  attacks: 
This attack  is carried out when an attacker places 
himself  between  two  users.  Anytime  attackers 
can  place  themselves  in  the  communication’s 
path,  there 
that 
they  can 
intercept and modify communications.  
e.  Inside-job:  This  kind  of  attack  is  when  the 
person, employee or staffs who  is knowledgeable 
of how the system runs, from client to server then 
he  can 
to  destroy 
everything in the cloud system. 
 
Security 
It  is  clear  that  the  security  issue  has  played  the 
most 
in  hindering  Cloud 
computing.  Without  doubt,putting  your  data, 
running  your  software  at  someone  else's  hard  
disk  using someone else's CPU appears daunting 
to many. 
Well-known  security  issues  such  as  data  loss, 
phishing,  botnet 
remotely  on  a 
collection  of  machines)  pose  serious  threats  to 
organization's  data  and 
software  Security 
measures  assumed  in  the  cloud  must  be  made 
available  to  the  customers  to  gain  their  trust. 
There  is  always  a  possibility  that  the  cloud 
infrastructure  is  secured  with  respect  to  some 
requirements and the customers are  looking  for a 
different  set  of  security.  In  order  to  have  a 
secured  Cloud  computing  deployment,  we  must 
consider 
the  cloud 
computing  architecture,  Governance,  portability 
and  interoperability, traditional security, business 
continuity  and  disaster  recovery,  data  center 
operations,  incident  response,  notification  and 
remediation,  Application  Security,  Encryption 
and  Key  management, 
identity  and  access 
management. 
In  order 
following aspect must be considered:

Conclusion 
Understanding  a  technical  area  as  complex  as 
cloud  computing 
is  not  easy  and  requires 
identifying  its  fundamental  characteristics.  Clear 
concepts  and  terminology  into  cloud  computing 
help but do not entirely solve the problem of how 
to  design,  develop  and  adopt  a  cloud  computing 
system. 
One  of  the  core  services  pro vided  by  cloud 
computing 
is  data  storage.  This  poses  new 
challenges  in  creating  secure  and  reliable  data 
storage  and  access  facilities  over  remote  service 
providers  in  the  cloud.  The  security  of  data 
storage  is  one  of  the  necessary  tasks  to  be 
addressed  before 
for  cloud 
computing is accepted. In this paper we discussed 
the  security  requirements  of  cloud  computing 
data  storage  security  and  the  solutions  for  the 
security problems. 
 As  a  part  of  the  future  work,  first,  we’d  like  to 
get  detail  of  each  characteristic  especially  the 
inner  technologies  .Second,  we  have  more  than 
ten  years  experience  in  HPC  area  and  wish  to 
syncretize  the HPC  into cloud computing.  Third,  
the  evaluation  of  cloud  services  is  an  interesting 
and valuable 
research subject.
