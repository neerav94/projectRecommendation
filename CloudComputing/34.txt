ABSTRACT: 
Cloud  Computing  has  become  a  scalable  services  consumption  and  delivery  platform  in  the  field  of 
Services  Computing.  The  technical  foundations  of  Cloud  Computing 
include  Service-Oriented 
Architecture  (SOA)  and  Virtualizations  of  hardware  and  software.  The  goal  of  Cloud  Computing  is  to 
share resources among the cloud service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value 
chain.  The  resource  sharing  at  various  levels  results  in  various  cloud  offerings  such  as  infrastructure 
cloud (e.g. hardware, IT infrastructure management), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware 
as  a  service,  or  traditional  CRM  as  a  service),  application  cloud  (e.g.  Application  as  a  Service,  UML 
modeling  tools  as  a  service,  social  network  as  a  service),  and  business  cloud  (e.g.  business  process  as  a 
service).  
  
Cloud  computing  is  a  highly  scalable  and  cost-effective  infrastructure  for  running  HPC, 
enterprise and Web applications. However, the growing demand of Cloud infrastructure has drastically 
increased  the  energy  consumption  of  data  centers,  which  has  become  a  critical  issue.  High  energy 
consumption  not  only  translates  to  high  operational  cost,  which  reduces  the  profit  margin  of  Cloud 
providers, but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-
efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order 
to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. In this 
research  paper  I  have  focused  on  the  needs  of  developing  applications  that  will  help  to  make  load 
balances so as to facilitate effective applications design and alogorithmic approach. The efficiency of an 
algorithm has an impact on the resources required for a computing function and at times one may need to 
do  trade-offs  while  writing  programs.  Cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  paradigm  which  is  enabling 
outsourcing of all IT needs such as storage, computation and software such as office and ERP, through 
large  Internet.  The  shift  toward  such  service-oriented  computing  is  driven  primarily  by  ease  of 
management  and  administration  process  involving  software  upgrades  and  bug  fixes.  It  also  allows  fast 
application  development  and  testing  for  small  IT  companies  that  cannot  afford  large  investments  on 
infrastructure.  Most  important  advantage  offered  by  Clouds  is  in  terms  of  economics  of  scale;  that  is, 
when  thousands  of  users  share  same  facility,  cost  per  user  and  the  server  utilization.  To  enable  such 
facilities,  Cloud  computing  encompasses  many  technologies  and  concepts  such  as  virtualization,  utility 
computing, pay as you go, no capital investment, elasticity, scalability, provisioning on demand, and IT 
outsourcing.

a service provider, of large pools of high performance computing resources and high-capacity storage devices 
that  are  shared  among  end  users  as  required.  There  are  many  cloud  service  models,  but  generally,  end  users 
subscribing  to  the  service  have  their  data  hosted  by  the  service,  and  have  computing  resources  allocated  on 
demand from the pool. The service provider’s offering may also extend to the software applications required by 
the  end  user.  To  be  successful,  the  cloud  service  model  also  requires  a  high-speed  network  to  provide 
connection between the end user and the service provider’s infrastructure. Cloud computing potentially offers an 
overall  financial  benefit,  in  that  end  users  share  a  large,  centrally  managed  pool  of  storage  and  computing 
resources, rather than owning and  managing their own systems . Often  using existing data centers as a basis, 
cloud service providers invest in the necessary infrastructure and management. 

2.  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 

Network-based cloud computing is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. 
As  cloud  computing  becomes  more  widespread,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  network  and  computing 
resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being 
paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology 
(ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention 
paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to 
the cloud. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching 
and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient 
use  of  computing  power,  especially  when  the  computing  tasks  are  of  low  intensity  or  infrequent.  However, 
under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each 
user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC). 
According to IDC (International Data Corporation) report, the global IT Cloud services spending is estimated to 
increase from $16 billion in 2008 to $42 billion in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 27%. Attracted by this growth prospects, Web-based companies (Amazon, eBay, Salesforce.com), hardware 
vendors  (HP,  IBM,  Cisco),  telecom  providers  (AT&T,  Verizon),  software  firms  (EMC/VMware,  Oracle/Sun, 
Microsoft) and others are all investing huge amount of capital in establishing Cloud datacenters. According to 
Google‟s earnings reports, the company has spent $US1.9 billion on datacenters in 2006, and $US2.4 billion in 
2007

Gartner estimated that SaaS market in India was US$27 million in 2007. According to a study by Springboard 
Research, the Indian SaaS  market  would  experience a  CAGR (compound annual  growth rate) of 77% during 
2006-2010  and  will  reach  US$165  million  in  2010  (IANS  2008).  According  to  a  study  by  India’s  National 
Association  of  Software  and  Services  Companies  (NASSCOM)  and  Mckinsey,  remote  infrastructure 
management will be a US$15 billion industry in India by 2013. In September 2008, IBM opened a cloud center 
in  Bangalore,  which  targets  mid-market  vendors,  universities,  government  bodies  and  microfinance  and 
telecommunications companies (Channelworld 2008). Indian universities are banking on the cloud to develop 
innovative  research  and  education  activities.  The  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  (IIT),  Kanpur  and  other 
academic institutions use the cloud (MacMillan 2009; Raghu 2008).  
In November 2009, Microsoft India announced commercial availability of cloud

services  such  as  e-mail,  collaboration,  conferencing  and  productivity  starting  US$2  per  user  per  month  (HT 
2009). These services are mainly targeted to SMEs. India also has a number of local cloud providers (Table 2). 
In  July  2009,  VMware  opened  a  cloud  center  in  Pune  (eeherald.com  2009).  Likewise,  the  U.S.  Company, 
Parallels  announced  a  plan  to  establish  cloud  operations  in  India  (Desai  2009).  The  SaaS  vendor, 
Salesforce.com,  which  started  its  operations  in  2005,  is  focusing  on  cities  such  as  Bangalore,  Gurgaon  and 
Mumbai and is taking measures to create cloud awareness. Salesforce.com’s clients include big companies such 
as  Bharti  AXA  General  Insurance,  eBay  India,  Sify  Technologies,  Polaris  Software  Labs,  Lodha  Group, 
Servion,  Maytas  Properties,  HCL,  Sasken  Communication  Technologies,  Ocimum  Biosolutions,  and  state 
owned National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) (Srikanth 2009). The Indian offshoring industry is 
probably the prime example of an industry that is likely to feel the impact of cloud computing. The demand for 
cloud related services is especially high in the offshoring industry and technology hubs such as Bangalore and 
Delhi  (Economic  Times  2009).  In  summary,  Cloud  computing,  being  an  emerging  technology  also  raises 
significant 
sustainability. 
While financial benefits of Cloud computing have been analyzed widely in the literature, the energy efficiency 
of Cloud computing as a whole has not been analyzed. Through the use of large shared virtualized datacenters 
Cloud computing can offer large energy savings. However, Cloud services can also further increase the internet 
traffic  and  its  growing  information  database  which  could  decrease  such  energy  savings.  Thus,  this  chapter 
explores  the  environmental  sustainability  of  Cloud  computing  by  analyzing  various  technologies  and 
mechanism that support this goal. Our analysis is important for users and organization that are looking at Cloud 
computing as a solution for their administrative, infrastructural and management problems. 
Cloud Computing and Energy Usage Model: A Typical Example  
In  this  section,  through  a  typical  Cloud  usage  scenario  we  will  analyze  various  elements  of  Clouds  and  their 
energy  efficiency.  Figure  5  shows  an  end  user  accessing  Cloud  services  such  as  SaaS,  PaaS,  or  IaaS  over 
Internet.  User  data  pass  from  his  own  device  through  an  Internet  service  provider‟s  router,  which  in  turn 
connects  to  a  Gateway  router  within  a  Cloud  datacenter.  Within  datacenters,  data  goes  through  a  local  area 
network and are processed on virtual machines, hosting Cloud services, which may access storage servers. Each 
of  these  computing  and  network  devices  that  are  directly  accessed  to  serve  Cloud  users  contribute  to  energy 
consumption. In addition, within a Cloud datacenter, there are many other devices, such as cooling and electrical 
devicies, that consume power. These devices even though do not directly  
help in providing Cloud service, are the major contributors to the power consumption of a Cloud datacenter. In 
the following section, we discuss in detail the energy consumption of these devices and applications.

Features of Clouds enabling Green computing  
Even though there is a great concern in the community that Cloud computing can result in higher energy usage 
by  the  datacenters,  the  Cloud  computing  has  a  green  lining.  There  are  several  technologies  and  concepts 
employed by Cloud providers to achieve better utilization and efficiency than traditional computing. Therefore, 
comparatively  lower  carbon  emission  is  expected  in  Cloud  computing  due  to  highly  energy  efficient 
infrastructure  and  reduction  in  the  IT  infrastructure  itself  by  multi-tenancy.  The  key  driver  technology  for 
energy efficient Clouds is “Virtualization,” which allows significant improvement in energy efficiency of Cloud 
providers by leveraging the economies of scale associated with large number of organizations sharing the same 
infrastructure. Virtualization is the process of presenting a logical grouping or subset of computing resources so 
that  they  can  be  accessed  in  ways  that  give  benefits  over  the  original  configuration  .  By  consolidation  of 
underutilized servers in the form of multiple virtual machines sharing same physical server at higher utilization, 
companies can gain high savings in the form of space, management, and energy. According to Accenture Report 
, there are following four key factors that have enabled the Cloud computing to lower energy usage and carbon 
emissions from ICT. Due to these Cloud features, organizations can reduce carbon emissions by atleast 30% per 
user by moving their applications to the Cloud. These savings are driven by the high efficiency of large scale 
Cloud data centers 
 
Towards Energy Efficiency of Cloud computing: State-of-the-Art  
1- Applications  
SaaS model has changed the way applications and software are distributed and used. More and more companies 
are  switching  to  SaaS  Clouds  to  minimize  their  IT  cost.  Thus,  it  has  become  very  important  to  address  the 
energy efficiency at application level itself. However, this layer has received very little attraction since  many 
applications are already on use and most of the new applications are mostly upgraded version of or developed 
using previously implemented tools

increased  the  energy  consumption  of  data  centers,  which  has  become  a  critical  issue.  High  energy 
consumption  not  only  translates  to  high  operational  cost,  which  reduces  the  profit  margin  of  Cloud 
providers, but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-
efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order 
to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. In this 
research  paper  I  have  focused  on  the  needs  of  developing  applications  that  will  help  to  make  load 
balances so as to facilitate effective applications design and alogorithmic approach. The efficiency of an 
algorithm has an impact on the resources required for a computing function and at times one may need to 
do  trade-offs  while  writing  programs.  Cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  paradigm  which  is  enabling 
outsourcing of all IT needs such as storage, computation and software such as office and ERP, through 
large  Internet.  The  shift  toward  such  service-oriented  computing  is  driven  primarily  by  ease  of 
management  and  administration  process  involving  software  upgrades  and  bug  fixes.  It  also  allows  fast 
application  development  and  testing  for  small  IT  companies  that  cannot  afford  large  investments  on 
infrastructure.  Most  important  advantage  offered  by  Clouds  is  in  terms  of  economics  of  scale;  that  is, 
when  thousands  of  users  share  same  facility,  cost  per  user  and  the  server  utilization.  To  enable  such 
facilities,  Cloud  computing  encompasses  many  technologies  and  concepts  such  as  virtualization,  utility 
computing, pay as you go, no capital investment, elasticity, scalability, provisioning on demand, and IT 
outsourcing.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  the  Science  Conclave  2013  of  Indian  Institute  of  Information  Technology  Allahabad,Nobel  Laurete  in 
Geography “Professor Walter J kohan”,says on 10th December 2013,that “ the biggest challenge for the Young 
Generation is Crisis Of Energy and Environmental Issues.” A study by environmental campaign group Global 
Action Plan  into Green Cloud Computing found that IT infrastructure accounts for 10% of the UK's annual 
energy consumption. This results in the same amount of CO2 emissions given off by airplanes. We should be 
committed to reducing  CO2 footprint and by innovating the organisations with Green Cloud Computing we can 
play a considerable role in lessening the impact of your computing on the environment. 

The increasing availability of high-speed Internet and corporate IP connections is enabling the delivery of new 
network-based  services  .  While  Internet-based  mail  services  have  been  operating  for  many  years,  service 
offerings have recently expanded to include network-based storage and network-based computing. These new 
services  are  being  offered  both  to  corporate  and  individual  end  users  .  Services  of  this  type  have  been 
generically called Bcloud computing[ services ]. The cloud computing service model involves the provision, by

a service provider, of large pools of high performance computing resources and high-capacity storage devices 
that  are  shared  among  end  users  as  required.  There  are  many  cloud  service  models,  but  generally,  end  users 
subscribing  to  the  service  have  their  data  hosted  by  the  service,  and  have  computing  resources  allocated  on 
demand from the pool. The service provider’s offering may also extend to the software applications required by 
the  end  user.  To  be  successful,  the  cloud  service  model  also  requires  a  high-speed  network  to  provide 
connection between the end user and the service provider’s infrastructure. Cloud computing potentially offers an 
overall  financial  benefit,  in  that  end  users  share  a  large,  centrally  managed  pool  of  storage  and  computing 
resources, rather than owning and  managing their own systems . Often  using existing data centers as a basis, 
cloud service providers invest in the necessary infrastructure and management. 

2.  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 

Network-based cloud computing is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. 
As  cloud  computing  becomes  more  widespread,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  network  and  computing 
resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being 
paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology 
(ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention 
paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to 
the cloud. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching 
and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient 
use  of  computing  power,  especially  when  the  computing  tasks  are  of  low  intensity  or  infrequent.  However, 
under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each 
user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC). 
According to IDC (International Data Corporation) report, the global IT Cloud services spending is estimated to 
increase from $16 billion in 2008 to $42 billion in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 27%. Attracted by this growth prospects, Web-based companies (Amazon, eBay, Salesforce.com), hardware 
vendors  (HP,  IBM,  Cisco),  telecom  providers  (AT&T,  Verizon),  software  firms  (EMC/VMware,  Oracle/Sun, 
Microsoft) and others are all investing huge amount of capital in establishing Cloud datacenters. According to 
Google‟s earnings reports, the company has spent $US1.9 billion on datacenters in 2006, and $US2.4 billion in 
2007 

 

 

3.  CLOUD COMPUTING IN INDIA 

Gartner estimated that SaaS market in India was US$27 million in 2007. According to a study by Springboard 
Research, the Indian SaaS  market  would  experience a  CAGR (compound annual  growth rate) of 77% during 
2006-2010  and  will  reach  US$165  million  in  2010  (IANS  2008).  According  to  a  study  by  India’s  National 
Association  of  Software  and  Services  Companies  (NASSCOM)  and  Mckinsey,  remote  infrastructure 
management will be a US$15 billion industry in India by 2013. In September 2008, IBM opened a cloud center 
in  Bangalore,  which  targets  mid-market  vendors,  universities,  government  bodies  and  microfinance  and 
telecommunications companies (Channelworld 2008). Indian universities are banking on the cloud to develop 
innovative  research  and  education  activities.  The  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  (IIT),  Kanpur  and  other 
academic institutions use the cloud (MacMillan 2009; Raghu 2008).  
In November 2009, Microsoft India announced commercial availability of cloud

services  such  as  e-mail,  collaboration,  conferencing  and  productivity  starting  US$2  per  user  per  month  (HT 
2009). These services are mainly targeted to SMEs. India also has a number of local cloud providers (Table 2). 
In  July  2009,  VMware  opened  a  cloud  center  in  Pune  (eeherald.com  2009).  Likewise,  the  U.S.  Company, 
Parallels  announced  a  plan  to  establish  cloud  operations  in  India  (Desai  2009).  The  SaaS  vendor, 
Salesforce.com,  which  started  its  operations  in  2005,  is  focusing  on  cities  such  as  Bangalore,  Gurgaon  and 
Mumbai and is taking measures to create cloud awareness. Salesforce.com’s clients include big companies such 
as  Bharti  AXA  General  Insurance,  eBay  India,  Sify  Technologies,  Polaris  Software  Labs,  Lodha  Group, 
Servion,  Maytas  Properties,  HCL,  Sasken  Communication  Technologies,  Ocimum  Biosolutions,  and  state 
owned National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) (Srikanth 2009). The Indian offshoring industry is 
probably the prime example of an industry that is likely to feel the impact of cloud computing. The demand for 
cloud related services is especially high in the offshoring industry and technology hubs such as Bangalore and 
Delhi  (Economic  Times  2009).  In  summary,  Cloud  computing,  being  an  emerging  technology  also  raises 
significant 
sustainability. 
While financial benefits of Cloud computing have been analyzed widely in the literature, the energy efficiency 
of Cloud computing as a whole has not been analyzed. Through the use of large shared virtualized datacenters 
Cloud computing can offer large energy savings. However, Cloud services can also further increase the internet 
traffic  and  its  growing  information  database  which  could  decrease  such  energy  savings.  Thus,  this  chapter 
explores  the  environmental  sustainability  of  Cloud  computing  by  analyzing  various  technologies  and 
mechanism that support this goal. Our analysis is important for users and organization that are looking at Cloud 
computing as a solution for their administrative, infrastructural and management problems. 
Cloud Computing and Energy Usage Model: A Typical Example  
In  this  section,  through  a  typical  Cloud  usage  scenario  we  will  analyze  various  elements  of  Clouds  and  their 
energy  efficiency.  Figure  5  shows  an  end  user  accessing  Cloud  services  such  as  SaaS,  PaaS,  or  IaaS  over 
Internet.  User  data  pass  from  his  own  device  through  an  Internet  service  provider‟s  router,  which  in  turn 
connects  to  a  Gateway  router  within  a  Cloud  datacenter.  Within  datacenters,  data  goes  through  a  local  area 
network and are processed on virtual machines, hosting Cloud services, which may access storage servers. Each 
of  these  computing  and  network  devices  that  are  directly  accessed  to  serve  Cloud  users  contribute  to  energy 
consumption. In addition, within a Cloud datacenter, there are many other devices, such as cooling and electrical 
devicies, that consume power. These devices even though do not directly  
help in providing Cloud service, are the major contributors to the power consumption of a Cloud datacenter. In 
the following section, we discuss in detail the energy consumption of these devices and applications.

Features of Clouds enabling Green computing  
Even though there is a great concern in the community that Cloud computing can result in higher energy usage 
by  the  datacenters,  the  Cloud  computing  has  a  green  lining.  There  are  several  technologies  and  concepts 
employed by Cloud providers to achieve better utilization and efficiency than traditional computing. Therefore, 
comparatively  lower  carbon  emission  is  expected  in  Cloud  computing  due  to  highly  energy  efficient 
infrastructure  and  reduction  in  the  IT  infrastructure  itself  by  multi-tenancy.  The  key  driver  technology  for 
energy efficient Clouds is “Virtualization,” which allows significant improvement in energy efficiency of Cloud 
providers by leveraging the economies of scale associated with large number of organizations sharing the same 
infrastructure. Virtualization is the process of presenting a logical grouping or subset of computing resources so 
that  they  can  be  accessed  in  ways  that  give  benefits  over  the  original  configuration  .  By  consolidation  of 
underutilized servers in the form of multiple virtual machines sharing same physical server at higher utilization, 
companies can gain high savings in the form of space, management, and energy. According to Accenture Report 
, there are following four key factors that have enabled the Cloud computing to lower energy usage and carbon 
emissions from ICT. Due to these Cloud features, organizations can reduce carbon emissions by atleast 30% per 
user by moving their applications to the Cloud. These savings are driven by the high efficiency of large scale 
Cloud data centers

1- Applications  
SaaS model has changed the way applications and software are distributed and used. More and more companies 
are  switching  to  SaaS  Clouds  to  minimize  their  IT  cost.  Thus,  it  has  become  very  important  to  address  the 
energy efficiency at application level itself. However, this layer has received very little attraction since  many 
applications are already on use and most of the new applications are mostly upgraded version of or developed 
using previously implemented tools

2 -Cloud Software Stack: Virtualization and Provisioning  
In the Cloud stack, most works in the literature address the challenges at the IaaS provider level where research 
focus is on scheduling and resource management to reduce the amount of active 

resources executing the workload of user applications. The consolidation of VMs, VM migration, scheduling, 
demand  projection,  heat  management  and  temperature-aware  allocation,  and  load  balancing  are  used  as  basic 
techniques for minimizing power consumption. 

3- Datacenter level: Cooling, Hardware, Network, and Storage  
The rising energy costs, cost savings and a desire to get more out of existing investments are making today’s 
Cloud  providers  to  adopt  best  practices  to  make  datacenters  operation  green.  To  build  energy  efficient 
datacenter,  several  best  practices  has  been  proposed  to  improve  efficiency  of  each  device  from  electrical 
systems to processor level. 

4 -Monitoring/Metering  
 It is said that you cannot improve what you do not measure. It is essential to construct power models that allow 
the system to know the energy consumed  by a particular device, and  how it can be reduced. To measure the 
unified  efficiency  of  a  datacenter  and  improve  its'  performance  per-watt,  the  Green  Grid  has  proposed  two 
specific  metrics  known  as  the  Power  Usage  Effectiveness  (PUE)  and  Datacenter  Infrastructure  Efficiency 
(DciE) .  

•  PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power  
•  DciE = 1/PUE = IT Equipment Power/Total Facility Power x 100%  

 
5- Network Infrastructure  
At network level, the energy efficiency is achieved either at the node level (i.e. network interface card) or at the 
infrastructure level (i.e. switches and routers). The energy efficiency issues in networking is usually referred to 
as “green networking”, which relates to embedding energy-awareness in the design, in the devices and in the 
protocols of networks. 

4.  GREEN CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 

 
From the above study of current efforts in making Cloud computing energy efficient, it shows that even though 
researchers have made various components of Cloud efficient in terms of power and performance, still they lack 
a unified picture. Most of efforts for sustainability of Cloud computing have missed the network contribution. If 
the file sizes are quite large, network  will become a major contributor to energy consumption; thus it  will be 
greener to run application locally than in Clouds. Furthermore, many work focused on just particular component 
of  Cloud  computing  while  neglecting  effect  of  other,  which  may  not  result  in  overall  energy  efficiency.  For 
example, VM consolidation may reduce number of active servers but it will put excessive load on few servers 
where heat distribution can become a major issue. Some other works just focus on redistribution of workload to 
support energy efficient cooling  without considering the effect of virtualization. In addition, Cloud providers, 
being  profit  oriented,  are  looking  for  solutions  which  can  reduce  the  power  consumption  and  thus,  carbon 
emission  without  hurting  their  market.  Therefore,  we  provide  a  unified  solution  to  enable  Green  Cloud 
computing.  We  propose  a  Green  Cloud  framework,  which  takes  into  account  these  goals  of  provider  while 
curbing  the  energy  consumption  of  Clouds.  The  high  level  view  of  the  green  Cloud  architecture  is  given  in 
Figure . The goal of this architecture is to make Cloud green from both user and provider’s perspective.

ABSTRACT: 
Cloud  Computing  has  become  a  scalable  services  consumption  and  delivery  platform  in  the  field  of 
Services  Computing.  The  technical  foundations  of  Cloud  Computing 
include  Service-Oriented 
Architecture  (SOA)  and  Virtualizations  of  hardware  and  software.  The  goal  of  Cloud  Computing  is  to 
share resources among the cloud service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value 
chain.  The  resource  sharing  at  various  levels  results  in  various  cloud  offerings  such  as  infrastructure 
cloud (e.g. hardware, IT infrastructure management), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware 
as  a  service,  or  traditional  CRM  as  a  service),  application  cloud  (e.g.  Application  as  a  Service,  UML 
modeling  tools  as  a  service,  social  network  as  a  service),  and  business  cloud  (e.g.  business  process  as  a 
service).  
  
Cloud  computing  is  a  highly  scalable  and  cost-effective  infrastructure  for  running  HPC, 
enterprise and Web applications. However, the growing demand of Cloud infrastructure has drastically 
increased  the  energy  consumption  of  data  centers,  which  has  become  a  critical  issue.  High  energy 
consumption  not  only  translates  to  high  operational  cost,  which  reduces  the  profit  margin  of  Cloud 
providers, but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-
efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order 
to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. In this 
research  paper  I  have  focused  on  the  needs  of  developing  applications  that  will  help  to  make  load 
balances so as to facilitate effective applications design and alogorithmic approach. The efficiency of an 
algorithm has an impact on the resources required for a computing function and at times one may need to 
do  trade-offs  while  writing  programs.  Cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  paradigm  which  is  enabling 
outsourcing of all IT needs such as storage, computation and software such as office and ERP, through

when  thousands  of  users  share  same  facility,  cost  per  user  and  the  server  utilization.  To  enable  such 
facilities,  Cloud  computing  encompasses  many  technologies  and  concepts  such  as  virtualization,  utility

2.  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 

Network-based cloud computing is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. 
As  cloud  computing  becomes  more  widespread,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  network  and  computing 
resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being 
paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology 
(ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention 
paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to

and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient 
use  of  computing  power,  especially  when  the  computing  tasks  are  of  low  intensity  or  infrequent.  However, 
under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each 
user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC). 
According to IDC (International Data Corporation) report, the global IT Cloud services spending is estimated to 
increase from $16 billion in 2008 to $42 billion in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 27%. Attracted by this growth prospects, Web-based companies (Amazon, eBay, Salesforce.com), hardware

Google‟s earnings reports, the company has spent $US1.9 billion on datacenters in 2006, and $US2.4 billion in 
2007

infrastructure  and  reduction  in  the  IT  infrastructure  itself  by  multi-tenancy.  The  key  driver  technology  for 
energy efficient Clouds is “Virtualization,” which allows significant improvement in energy efficiency of Cloud 
providers by leveraging the economies of scale associated with large number of organizations sharing the same 
infrastructure. Virtualization is the process of presenting a logical grouping or subset of computing resources so 
that  they  can  be  accessed  in  ways  that  give  benefits  over  the  original  configuration  .  By  consolidation  of 
underutilized servers in the form of multiple virtual machines sharing same physical server at higher utilization, 
companies can gain high savings in the form of space, management, and energy. According to Accenture Report 
, there are following four key factors that have enabled the Cloud computing to lower energy usage and carbon 
emissions from ICT. Due to these Cloud features, organizations can reduce carbon emissions by atleast 30% per 
user by moving their applications to the Cloud. These savings are driven by the high efficiency of large scale 
Cloud data centers 
 
Towards Energy Efficiency of Cloud computing: State-of-the-Art  
1- Applications  
SaaS model has changed the way applications and software are distributed and used. More and more companies 
are  switching  to  SaaS  Clouds  to  minimize  their  IT  cost.  Thus,  it  has  become  very  important  to  address  the 
energy efficiency at application level itself. However, this layer has received very little attraction since  many 
applications are already on use and most of the new applications are mostly upgraded version of or developed 
using previously implemented tools

2 -Cloud Software Stack: Virtualization and Provisioning  
In the Cloud stack, most works in the literature address the challenges at the IaaS provider level where research 
focus is on scheduling and resource management to reduce the amount of active 

resources executing the workload of user applications. The consolidation of VMs, VM migration, scheduling, 
demand  projection,  heat  management  and  temperature-aware  allocation,  and  load  balancing  are  used  as  basic 
techniques for minimizing power consumption. 

3- Datacenter level: Cooling, Hardware, Network, and Storage  
The rising energy costs, cost savings and a desire to get more out of existing investments are making today’s 
Cloud  providers  to  adopt  best  practices  to  make  datacenters  operation  green.  To  build  energy  efficient 
datacenter,  several  best  practices  has  been  proposed  to  improve  efficiency  of  each  device  from  electrical 
systems to processor level. 

4 -Monitoring/Metering  
 It is said that you cannot improve what you do not measure. It is essential to construct power models that allow 
the system to know the energy consumed  by a particular device, and  how it can be reduced. To measure the 
unified  efficiency  of  a  datacenter  and  improve  its'  performance  per-watt,  the  Green  Grid  has  proposed  two 
specific  metrics  known  as  the  Power  Usage  Effectiveness  (PUE)  and  Datacenter  Infrastructure  Efficiency 
(DciE) .  

•  PUE = Total Facility Power/IT Equipment Power  
•  DciE = 1/PUE = IT Equipment Power/Total Facility Power x 100%  

 
5- Network Infrastructure  
At network level, the energy efficiency is achieved either at the node level (i.e. network interface card) or at the 
infrastructure level (i.e. switches and routers). The energy efficiency issues in networking is usually referred to 
as “green networking”, which relates to embedding energy-awareness in the design, in the devices and in the 
protocols of networks. 

4.  GREEN CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 

 
From the above study of current efforts in making Cloud computing energy efficient, it shows that even though 
researchers have made various components of Cloud efficient in terms of power and performance, still they lack 
a unified picture. Most of efforts for sustainability of Cloud computing have missed the network contribution. If 
the file sizes are quite large, network  will become a major contributor to energy consumption; thus it  will be 
greener to run application locally than in Clouds. Furthermore, many work focused on just particular component 
of  Cloud  computing  while  neglecting  effect  of  other,  which  may  not  result  in  overall  energy  efficiency.  For 
example, VM consolidation may reduce number of active servers but it will put excessive load on few servers 
where heat distribution can become a major issue. Some other works just focus on redistribution of workload to 
support energy efficient cooling  without considering the effect of virtualization. In addition, Cloud providers, 
being  profit  oriented,  are  looking  for  solutions  which  can  reduce  the  power  consumption  and  thus,  carbon 
emission  without  hurting  their  market.  Therefore,  we  provide  a  unified  solution  to  enable  Green  Cloud 
computing.  We  propose  a  Green  Cloud  framework,  which  takes  into  account  these  goals  of  provider  while 
curbing  the  energy  consumption  of  Clouds.  The  high  level  view  of  the  green  Cloud  architecture  is  given  in 
Figure . The goal of this architecture is to make Cloud green from both user and provider’s perspective.

Need to Develop optimized Algorithms 
Use efficient algorithms. For example, use fast search algorithms such as hashed or indexed search algorithms 
instead of slow linear search algorithms. Cost optimization can be achieved by using algorithms to route the data 
to data center where electricity is cheaper. In case data center is facing warm weather, traffic could be routed 
away to cut energy usage, allowing the servers to shut down and avoid using the air conditioning.   We have 
seen  above  how  different  measures  such  as  cloud  data  center  design,  increasing  resource  longevity,  resource 
consolidation and optimization help achieve green computing in the cloud context.  There is scope for further 
reducing the carbon footprint in the Cloud. Research is being done in areas such as optimization of data center 
hardware and software, improving power supply chain and data center cooling technologies.   
 

5.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

 
Cloud computing business potential and contribution to already aggravating carbon emission from ICT, has lead 
to  a  series  of  discussion  whether  Cloud  computing  is  really  green.  It  is  forecasted  that  the  environmental 
footprint from data centers will triple between 2002 and 2020, which is currently 7.8 billion tons of  CO2 per 
year.  There  are  reports  on  Green  IT  analysis  of  Clouds  and  datacenters  that  show  that  Cloud  computing  is 
“Green”, while others show that it will lead to alarming increase in Carbon emission. Thus, we should analyze 
the  benefits  offered  by  Cloud  computing  by  studying  its  fundamental  definitions  and  benefits,  the  services  it 
offers  to  end  users,  and  its  deployment  model.  Then,  we  should  focus  our  discussion  to  the  components  of 
Clouds that contribute to carbon emission and the features of Clouds that make it “Green”. We also discussed 
several research efforts and technologies that increase the energy efficiency of various aspects of Clouds. For 
this study, we identified several unexplored areas that can help in maximizing the energy efficiency of Clouds 
from a holistic perspective. After analyzing the shortcoming of previous solutions, we proposed a Green Cloud 
Framework  and  presented  some  results  for  its  validation.  Even  though  our  Green  Cloud  framework  embeds 
various features to make Cloud computing much more Green, there are still many technological solutions are 
required to make it a reality: 

•  First  efforts  are  required  in  designing  software  at  various  levels  (OS,  compiler,  algorithm  and 

application) that facilitates system wide energy efficiency.  

•  To enable the green Cloud datacenters, the Cloud providers need to understand and measure existing 
datacenter power and cooling designs, power consumptions of servers and their cooling requirements, 
and equipment resource utilization to achieve maximum efficiency.  

•  For designing the holistic solutions in the scheduling and resource provisioning of applications within 

the datacenter, all the factors such as cooling, network, memory, and CPU should be considered.

GREEN CLOUD COMPUTING 

“The NEED of the hour”

ABSTRACT: 
Cloud  Computing  has  become  a  scalable  services  consumption  and  delivery  platform  in  the  field  of 
Services  Computing.  The  technical  foundations  of  Cloud  Computing 
include  Service-Oriented 
Architecture  (SOA)  and  Virtualizations  of  hardware  and  software.  The  goal  of  Cloud  Computing  is  to 
share resources among the cloud service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value 
chain.  The  resource  sharing  at  various  levels  results  in  various  cloud  offerings  such  as  infrastructure 
cloud (e.g. hardware, IT infrastructure management), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware 
as  a  service,  or  traditional  CRM  as  a  service),  application  cloud  (e.g.  Application  as  a  Service,  UML 
modeling  tools  as  a  service,  social  network  as  a  service),  and  business  cloud  (e.g.  business  process  as  a 
service).  
  
Cloud  computing  is  a  highly  scalable  and  cost-effective  infrastructure  for  running  HPC, 
enterprise and Web applications. However, the growing demand of Cloud infrastructure has drastically 
increased  the  energy  consumption  of  data  centers,  which  has  become  a  critical  issue.  High  energy 
consumption  not  only  translates  to  high  operational  cost,  which  reduces  the  profit  margin  of  Cloud 
providers, but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-
efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order 
to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. In this 
research  paper  I  have  focused  on  the  needs  of  developing  applications  that  will  help  to  make  load 
balances so as to facilitate effective applications design and alogorithmic approach. The efficiency of an 
algorithm has an impact on the resources required for a computing function and at times one may need to 
do  trade-offs  while  writing  programs.  Cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  paradigm  which  is  enabling 
outsourcing of all IT needs such as storage, computation and software such as office and ERP, through 
large  Internet.  The  shift  toward  such  service-oriented  computing  is  driven  primarily  by  ease  of 
management  and  administration  process  involving  software  upgrades  and  bug  fixes.  It  also  allows  fast 
application  development  and  testing  for  small  IT  companies  that  cannot  afford  large  investments  on 
infrastructure.  Most  important  advantage  offered  by  Clouds  is  in  terms  of  economics  of  scale;  that  is, 
when  thousands  of  users  share  same  facility,  cost  per  user  and  the  server  utilization.  To  enable  such 
facilities,  Cloud  computing  encompasses  many  technologies  and  concepts  such  as  virtualization,  utility 
computing, pay as you go, no capital investment, elasticity, scalability, provisioning on demand, and IT 
outsourcing.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  the  Science  Conclave  2013  of  Indian  Institute  of  Information  Technology  Allahabad,Nobel  Laurete  in 
Geography “Professor Walter J kohan”,says on 10th December 2013,that “ the biggest challenge for the Young 
Generation is Crisis Of Energy and Environmental Issues.” A study by environmental campaign group Global 
Action Plan  into Green Cloud Computing found that IT infrastructure accounts for 10% of the UK's annual 
energy consumption. This results in the same amount of CO2 emissions given off by airplanes. We should be 
committed to reducing  CO2 footprint and by innovating the organisations with Green Cloud Computing we can 
play a considerable role in lessening the impact of your computing on the environment. 

The increasing availability of high-speed Internet and corporate IP connections is enabling the delivery of new 
network-based  services  .  While  Internet-based  mail  services  have  been  operating  for  many  years,  service 
offerings have recently expanded to include network-based storage and network-based computing. These new 
services  are  being  offered  both  to  corporate  and  individual  end  users  .  Services  of  this  type  have  been 
generically called Bcloud computing[ services ]. The cloud computing service model involves the provision, by

a service provider, of large pools of high performance computing resources and high-capacity storage devices 
that  are  shared  among  end  users  as  required.  There  are  many  cloud  service  models,  but  generally,  end  users 
subscribing  to  the  service  have  their  data  hosted  by  the  service,  and  have  computing  resources  allocated  on 
demand from the pool. The service provider’s offering may also extend to the software applications required by 
the  end  user.  To  be  successful,  the  cloud  service  model  also  requires  a  high-speed  network  to  provide 
connection between the end user and the service provider’s infrastructure. Cloud computing potentially offers an 
overall  financial  benefit,  in  that  end  users  share  a  large,  centrally  managed  pool  of  storage  and  computing 
resources, rather than owning and  managing their own systems . Often  using existing data centers as a basis, 
cloud service providers invest in the necessary infrastructure and management. 

2.  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 

Network-based cloud computing is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. 
As  cloud  computing  becomes  more  widespread,  the  energy  consumption  of  the  network  and  computing 
resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being 
paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology 
(ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention 
paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to 
the cloud. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching 
and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient 
use  of  computing  power,  especially  when  the  computing  tasks  are  of  low  intensity  or  infrequent.  However, 
under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each 
user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC). 
According to IDC (International Data Corporation) report, the global IT Cloud services spending is estimated to 
increase from $16 billion in 2008 to $42 billion in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 27%. Attracted by this growth prospects, Web-based companies (Amazon, eBay, Salesforce.com), hardware 
vendors  (HP,  IBM,  Cisco),  telecom  providers  (AT&T,  Verizon),  software  firms  (EMC/VMware,  Oracle/Sun, 
Microsoft) and others are all investing huge amount of capital in establishing Cloud datacenters. According to 
Google‟s earnings reports, the company has spent $US1.9 billion on datacenters in 2006, and $US2.4 billion in 
2007 

 

 

3.  CLOUD COMPUTING IN INDIA 

Gartner estimated that SaaS market in India was US$27 million in 2007. According to a study by Springboard 
Research, the Indian SaaS  market  would  experience a  CAGR (compound annual  growth rate) of 77% during 
2006-2010  and  will  reach  US$165  million  in  2010  (IANS  2008).  According  to  a  study  by  India’s  National 
Association  of  Software  and  Services  Companies  (NASSCOM)  and  Mckinsey,  remote  infrastructure 
management will be a US$15 billion industry in India by 2013. In September 2008, IBM opened a cloud center 
in  Bangalore,  which  targets  mid-market  vendors,  universities,  government  bodies  and  microfinance  and 
telecommunications companies (Channelworld 2008). Indian universities are banking on the cloud to develop 
innovative  research  and  education  activities.  The  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  (IIT),  Kanpur  and  other 
academic institutions use the cloud (MacMillan 2009; Raghu 2008).  
In November 2009, Microsoft India announced commercial availability of cloud

services  such  as  e-mail,  collaboration,  conferencing  and  productivity  starting  US$2  per  user  per  month  (HT 
2009). These services are mainly targeted to SMEs. India also has a number of local cloud providers (Table 2). 
In  July  2009,  VMware  opened  a  cloud  center  in  Pune  (eeherald.com  2009).  Likewise,  the  U.S.  Company, 
Parallels  announced  a  plan  to  establish  cloud  operations  in  India  (Desai  2009).  The  SaaS  vendor, 
Salesforce.com,  which  started  its  operations  in  2005,  is  focusing  on  cities  such  as  Bangalore,  Gurgaon  and 
Mumbai and is taking measures to create cloud awareness. Salesforce.com’s clients include big companies such 
as  Bharti  AXA  General  Insurance,  eBay  India,  Sify  Technologies,  Polaris  Software  Labs,  Lodha  Group, 
Servion,  Maytas  Properties,  HCL,  Sasken  Communication  Technologies,  Ocimum  Biosolutions,  and  state 
owned National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) (Srikanth 2009). The Indian offshoring industry is 
probably the prime example of an industry that is likely to feel the impact of cloud computing. The demand for 
cloud related services is especially high in the offshoring industry and technology hubs such as Bangalore and 
Delhi  (Economic  Times  2009).  In  summary,  Cloud  computing,  being  an  emerging  technology  also  raises 
significant 
sustainability. 
While financial benefits of Cloud computing have been analyzed widely in the literature, the energy efficiency 
of Cloud computing as a whole has not been analyzed. Through the use of large shared virtualized datacenters 
Cloud computing can offer large energy savings. However, Cloud services can also further increase the internet 
traffic  and  its  growing  information  database  which  could  decrease  such  energy  savings.  Thus,  this  chapter 
explores  the  environmental  sustainability  of  Cloud  computing  by  analyzing  various  technologies  and 
mechanism that support this goal. Our analysis is important for users and organization that are looking at Cloud 
computing as a solution for their administrative, infrastructural and management problems. 
Cloud Computing and Energy Usage Model: A Typical Example  
In  this  section,  through  a  typical  Cloud  usage  scenario  we  will  analyze  various  elements  of  Clouds  and  their 
energy  efficiency.  Figure  5  shows  an  end  user  accessing  Cloud  services  such  as  SaaS,  PaaS,  or  IaaS  over 
Internet.  User  data  pass  from  his  own  device  through  an  Internet  service  provider‟s  router,  which  in  turn 
connects  to  a  Gateway  router  within  a  Cloud  datacenter.  Within  datacenters,  data  goes  through  a  local  area 
network and are processed on virtual machines, hosting Cloud services, which may access storage servers. Each 
of  these  computing  and  network  devices  that  are  directly  accessed  to  serve  Cloud  users  contribute  to  energy 
consumption. In addition, within a Cloud datacenter, there are many other devices, such as cooling and electrical 
devicies, that consume power. These devices even though do not directly  
help in providing Cloud service, are the major contributors to the power consumption of a Cloud datacenter. In 
the following section, we discuss in detail the energy consumption of these devices and applications.

Features of Clouds enabling Green computing  
Even though there is a great concern in the community that Cloud computing can result in higher energy usage 
by  the  datacenters,  the  Cloud  computing  has  a  green  lining.  There  are  several  technologies  and  concepts 
employed by Cloud providers to achieve better utilization and efficiency than traditional computing. Therefore, 
comparatively  lower  carbon  emission  is  expected  in  Cloud  computing  due  to  highly  energy  efficient

•  Last but not the least, the responsibility also goes to both providers and customers to make sure that 
emerging technologies do not bring irreversible changes which can bring threat to the health of human 
society.  
 

 

CONCLUSION 
In  conclusion,  by  simply  improving  the  efficiency  of  equipment,  Cloud  computing  cannot  be  claimed  to  be 
Green. What is important is to make its usage more carbon efficient both from user and provider‟s perspective. 
Cloud Providers need to reduce the electricity demand of Clouds and take major steps in using renewable energy 
sources rather than just looking for cost minimization. 

Our broad conclusion is that the energy consumption of cloud computing needs to be considered as an integrated 
supply chain logistics problem, in  which processing,  storage, and transport are all considered together. Using 
this approach, we have shown that cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient use of computing power, 
especially  when  the  users’  predominant  computing  tasks  are  of  low  intensity  or  infrequent.  However,  under 
some circumstances, cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each user 
performs all computing on their own PC. Even with energy-saving techniques such as server virtualization and 
advanced cooling systems, cloud computing is not always the greenest computing technology.
