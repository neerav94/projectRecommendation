Definitions of cloud computing 

Cloud computing is internet-based computing and latest trend in information technology (IT) 
world.  The  internet  is  frequently  represented  as  a  cloud  and  the  term  “cloud  computing” 
arises  from  that  analogy.  In  brief,  cloud  computing  is  the  dynamic  provisioning  of  IT 
capabilities (hardware, software, or services) from third parties over a network.  
              Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as 
hardware,  development  platforms  and/or  services)  [5].These  property  can  be  energetically 
reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  variable  load  (scale)  allowing  also  for  best  possible  resource 
utilization. This group of resources is typically demoralized by a pay-per-use model in which 
guarantees  are  offered  by  the  Infrastructure  Provider  by  means  of  customized  service  level 
agreements. 

CLOUD SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

Security:  Concerns  the  confidentiality,  ease  of  use  and  reliability  of  data  or  information. 
Security may also include  validation and non-repudiation. 
Privacy: Concerns the expression of or devotion to various  legal and non- legal norms  regarding 
the  right  to  private  life.  It  would  be  there  highly  complex  to  map  cloud  issues  onto  the  full 
panoply  of  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  authoritarian  architectures,  the  internationally 
received  privacy principles  give a useful frame: consent,  purpose restriction,  legitimacy, simplicity, 
data security and data subject participation. 
Vulnerability:  According  to  the  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]”Vulnerability  is  the 
possibility  that  a  quality  will  be  unable  to  resist the  actions  of  a  threat  agent.  Vulnerability 
exists  when  there  is  a  differentiation  between  the  energy  being  applied  by  the  threat  agent, 
and  an  object’s  capability  to  oppose  that  strength  so,  vulnerability  should  all  the  time  be 
described in terms of conflict to a certain type of attack”. 
   

II.  CLOUD CHARACTERISTIC VULNERABILITIES 

Unauthorized  access  to  management  interface: The cloud feature on-demand self-service 
requires a management interface that’s nearby to cloud service users. Unconstitutional access 
to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant  vulnerability  for  cloud 
systems [4]. The probability that unauthorized access could come about is much higher than 
for  time-honoured  systems  where  the  management  functionality  is  reachable  only  to  a  few 
administrator. 
Internet  protocol  vulnerabilities:  The  cloud  characteristic  ever-present  network  access 
means that  cloud services are accessed via  network using standard protocols. In  most  cases, 
this  system  is  the  internet.  Internet  procedure  vulnerabilities  such  as  man-in-the-middle 
attacks are relevant for cloud computing. 
Data recovery vulnerability: The cloud individuality of pooling and flexibility involve that 
resources allocated to one user will be reallocated to a different user at a later time. Memory 
or storage property might be possible to recover data written by a previous user. 
Metering  and  billing  evasion:  The  cloud  feature  to  precise  services  means  that  any  cloud 
service  has  a  capability  at  a  generalization  level  appropriate  to  the  service  type  (such  as 
storage,  processing,  and  active  user  accounts).  Metering  data  used  to  optimize  examine

delivery with bill. Applicable vulnerabilities contain metering and billing data treatment and 
billing elusion. 
 

III.  Cloud Vulnerabilities 

Securely transferring data: Our data can be vulnerable to prying eyes as we hand on it and 
from  the  cloud.  Therefore  we  should  not  shift  important  or  confidential  data  in  an  open 
wireless  network,  in  a  random  public  Wi-Fi  network.  It  is  better to  use  our  home  network, 
and  to  make  sure  encrypting  our  data.  We  must  make  sure  that  our  wireless  router  is 
password-protected.  We  should  ensure  that  the  Web  addresses  of  sites  we  are  visiting  are 
HTTPS rather than simply HTTP. HTTPS sites are encrypted to transfer information safely. 

 

Accessing data: There is nothing worse than trying to recover our information and judgment 
is not presented. Customer wants to know that their data is available when they need.  

Before delegate a cloud provider with our records, we have to assess what sort of undertaking 
they have about uptime when our data is available and consider their track record. Generally 
superior off sticking with honest, big-name providers. 

Data  backup:  Our  data  isn’t  floating  around  in  the  clouds;  it’s  stored on  a  physical  server 
somewhere. So what  happens when there  is a hurricane or a flood or a power failure? Take 
the  time  to  evaluate  our  cloud  provider’s  disaster  recovery  plan  when  we  use  the  cloud  to 
store critical data then have our own backup too. In the privacy globe, they  talk concerning 
organizations  life  form custodian of data and that’s a good way to glance  at it. We  must be 
careful  as  we  are  handing  significant  information  over  to  an  important  person  else.  Ensure 
that our data exist elsewhere whether on an exterior hard drive, on our laptop’s hard drive or 
on a USB drive will give us peace of mind. 

Password  use:  Multiple  instance  of  hacks  and  data  breach  has  exposed  the  passwords  of 
users  of  well-known  websites  and  companies.  These  attacks  also  lean-to  light  on  what  a 
miserable job most of us do in using strong, unique passwords. We should try not to use the 
identical  password  for  all  our  activities  in  the  cloud.  If  we  use  the  similar  password  for  a 
gaming site as we do for our bank account, we place our assets at danger, if that making a bet 
password is cooperation. It is fine carry out to use a password administrator such as Last Pass. 

Privacy: Privacy is important consideration about the information we distribute. For example, 
why provide a phone number to sign up for an email news letter? Take the time to irregularly 
review which  mobile applications and third party services have access to  key accounts such 
as  Facebook  and  Twitter.  Reviewing  the  admission  grants  will  remind  us  to  sever  that 
connection, eliminate any option of utilization or mistreatment. 

Effective cloud securities are:  

 

(a)  BYOD  
(b) Data control  
(c)  Potential data loss  
(d) Enforcing security policies  
(e)  Visibility across all infrastructure resources,  
(f)  Traditional and cloud  
(g) Real-time analysis of log data  
(h) Compliance reporting

arises  from  that  analogy.  In  brief,  cloud  computing  is  the  dynamic  provisioning  of  IT 
capabilities (hardware, software, or services) from third parties over a network.  
              Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as 
hardware,  development  platforms  and/or  services)  [5].These  property  can  be  energetically 
reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  variable  load  (scale)  allowing  also  for  best  possible  resource 
utilization. This group of resources is typically demoralized by a pay-per-use model in which 
guarantees  are  offered  by  the  Infrastructure  Provider  by  means  of  customized  service  level 
agreements. 

CLOUD SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

Security:  Concerns  the  confidentiality,  ease  of  use  and  reliability  of  data  or  information. 
Security may also include  validation and non-repudiation. 
Privacy: Concerns the expression of or devotion to various  legal and non- legal norms  regarding 
the  right  to  private  life.  It  would  be  there  highly  complex  to  map  cloud  issues  onto  the  full 
panoply  of  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  authoritarian  architectures,  the  internationally 
received  privacy principles  give a useful frame: consent,  purpose restriction,  legitimacy, simplicity, 
data security and data subject participation. 
Vulnerability:  According  to  the  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]”Vulnerability  is  the 
possibility  that  a  quality  will  be  unable  to  resist the  actions  of  a  threat  agent.  Vulnerability 
exists  when  there  is  a  differentiation  between  the  energy  being  applied  by  the  threat  agent, 
and  an  object’s  capability  to  oppose  that  strength  so,  vulnerability  should  all  the  time  be 
described in terms of conflict to a certain type of attack”. 
   

II.  CLOUD CHARACTERISTIC VULNERABILITIES 

Unauthorized  access  to  management  interface: The cloud feature on-demand self-service 
requires a management interface that’s nearby to cloud service users. Unconstitutional access 
to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant  vulnerability  for  cloud 
systems [4]. The probability that unauthorized access could come about is much higher than 
for  time-honoured  systems  where  the  management  functionality  is  reachable  only  to  a  few 
administrator. 
Internet  protocol  vulnerabilities:  The  cloud  characteristic  ever-present  network  access 
means that  cloud services are accessed via  network using standard protocols. In  most  cases, 
this  system  is  the  internet.  Internet  procedure  vulnerabilities  such  as  man-in-the-middle 
attacks are relevant for cloud computing. 
Data recovery vulnerability: The cloud individuality of pooling and flexibility involve that 
resources allocated to one user will be reallocated to a different user at a later time. Memory 
or storage property might be possible to recover data written by a previous user. 
Metering  and  billing  evasion:  The  cloud  feature  to  precise  services  means  that  any  cloud 
service  has  a  capability  at  a  generalization  level  appropriate  to  the  service  type  (such  as 
storage,  processing,  and  active  user  accounts).  Metering  data  used  to  optimize  examine

billing elusion. 
 

III.  Cloud Vulnerabilities 

Securely transferring data: Our data can be vulnerable to prying eyes as we hand on it and 
from  the  cloud.  Therefore  we  should  not  shift  important  or  confidential  data  in  an  open 
wireless  network,  in  a  random  public  Wi-Fi  network.  It  is  better to  use  our  home  network, 
and  to  make  sure  encrypting  our  data.  We  must  make  sure  that  our  wireless  router  is 
password-protected.  We  should  ensure  that  the  Web  addresses  of  sites  we  are  visiting  are 
HTTPS rather than simply HTTP. HTTPS sites are encrypted to transfer information safely. 

 

Accessing data: There is nothing worse than trying to recover our information and judgment 
is not presented. Customer wants to know that their data is available when they need.  

Before delegate a cloud provider with our records, we have to assess what sort of undertaking 
they have about uptime when our data is available and consider their track record. Generally 
superior off sticking with honest, big-name providers. 

Data  backup:  Our  data  isn’t  floating  around  in  the  clouds;  it’s  stored on  a  physical  server 
somewhere. So what  happens when there  is a hurricane or a flood or a power failure? Take 
the  time  to  evaluate  our  cloud  provider’s  disaster  recovery  plan  when  we  use  the  cloud  to 
store critical data then have our own backup too. In the privacy globe, they  talk concerning 
organizations  life  form custodian of data and that’s a good way to glance  at it. We  must be 
careful  as  we  are  handing  significant  information  over  to  an  important  person  else.  Ensure 
that our data exist elsewhere whether on an exterior hard drive, on our laptop’s hard drive or 
on a USB drive will give us peace of mind. 

Password  use:  Multiple  instance  of  hacks  and  data  breach  has  exposed  the  passwords  of 
users  of  well-known  websites  and  companies.  These  attacks  also  lean-to  light  on  what  a 
miserable job most of us do in using strong, unique passwords. We should try not to use the 
identical  password  for  all  our  activities  in  the  cloud.  If  we  use  the  similar  password  for  a 
gaming site as we do for our bank account, we place our assets at danger, if that making a bet 
password is cooperation. It is fine carry out to use a password administrator such as Last Pass. 

Privacy: Privacy is important consideration about the information we distribute. For example, 
why provide a phone number to sign up for an email news letter? Take the time to irregularly 
review which  mobile applications and third party services have access to  key accounts such 
as  Facebook  and  Twitter.  Reviewing  the  admission  grants  will  remind  us  to  sever  that 
connection, eliminate any option of utilization or mistreatment. 

Effective cloud securities are:  

 

(a)  BYOD  
(b) Data control  
(c)  Potential data loss  
(d) Enforcing security policies  
(e)  Visibility across all infrastructure resources,  
(f)  Traditional and cloud

IV.  Vulnerabilities and threats architecture of Cloud computing 

In cloud computing users are no longer required to purchase hardware, software or to manage 
storages.  Due  to  the  development  of  this  technology  users  are  required  to  pay  for  cloud 
services on expenditure center. Fresh cloud based models are discussed, and implemented as 
solutions  in  form  of  on-demand  services  that  allows  businesses  to  enhance  their  efficiency 
and scalability. The benefits of cloud computing to various organizations are moving towards 
IT  solutions  that  are  based  on  cloud.  Before  opening  the  trip  to  cloud,  organization  must 
consider the possible threats and vulnerabilities that  may convert their dreams of enhancing 
scalability  and  saving  management  cost  into  a  terrible  of  data  loss  and  misuse.  Based  on 
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and research, NIST [8] have identified top seven threats and 
vulnerabilities that are the causes behind the creation of a Cloud.

Abstract— Cloud computing has been developed to decrease IT expenses and to provide alert IT services to 
human being users as well as organizations. Cloud computing is dynamic in nature; that is elastic, scalable 
and multi-shared with high capability that gives an innovative shape of carrying out business. The estimation 
of cloud computing security impact is difficult for two main reasons. Primary, as is true for many discussions 
about  basic  vocabulary  such  as  "risk,"  "threat,"  and  "vulnerability"  are  often  used  as  if  they  were 
exchangeable,  without  observe  to  their  particular  definition.  Secondary,  not  every  concern  that's  raise  is 
really  particular  to  cloud  computing.  The  important  factor  concerns  are  vulnerabilities.  Cloud  computing 
make  assured  well-understood  vulnerabilities  more  significant  and  adds  new  vulnerabilities.  Therefore  we 
need  to  define  cloud-specific  vulnerabilities,  cloud  feature  vulnerabilities  and  propose  a  reference 
vulnerabilities  architecture  of  cloud  computing.  In  this  paper  we  have  presented  taxonomy  of  cloud 
computing vulnerabilities.

INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing defined  in  Buyya  et  al.  [1] “A  Cloud  is  a  type  of  analogous  and scattered 
system  consisting  of  a  collection  of  inter-connected  and  virtualized  computers  that  are 
dynamically provisioned and presented as one or more unified computing resources based on 
service level agreements established through negotiation between the tune-up supplier”. The 
clients use the elevated excellence networks, application, servers and services  from a public 
pool  of  configurable  computing  capital  [3].  Many  corporations  including  Amazon,  Google, 
SUN,  IBM,  Oracle,  Intel,  HP,  and  Windows  Azure  have  invested  in  cloud  computing  and 
offers  cloud-based  solutions.  There  are  dissimilar  stories  about  what  cloud  computing 
“is”, there is one exact path that virtualization is headed that could bring along with it. Some 
other  harm  for  the  security  industry.  One  matter  to  focal  point  is  cantered  on  vulnerability 
managing and how it is implemented in a cloud environment. Customer’s are faced with the 
requirement  to  scan  their  cloud,  but  unable  to  do  so.  Virtualization  providers  have  been

distribution of CPU processing time for their applications. Across multiple reduced hardware 
devices.  Vulnerability  is  an  important  issue  of  risk.  ISO  27005  defines  risk  as  the  possible 
threat that a given threat will utilize vulnerabilities of a quality or group of assets and thereby 
origin  harm to the grouping   determine  it  in supplies of as one the chance of an occurrence 
and  its  result.  The  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]  for  cloud  computing  and  particularly 
about vulnerabilities is presented in the forth coming paragraphs.  
 

Definitions of cloud computing 

Cloud computing is internet-based computing and latest trend in information technology (IT) 
world.  The  internet  is  frequently  represented  as  a  cloud  and  the  term  “cloud  computing” 
arises  from  that  analogy.  In  brief,  cloud  computing  is  the  dynamic  provisioning  of  IT

              Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as 
hardware,  development  platforms  and/or  services)  [5].These  property  can  be  energetically 
reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  variable  load  (scale)  allowing  also  for  best  possible  resource 
utilization. This group of resources is typically demoralized by a pay-per-use model in which 
guarantees  are  offered  by  the  Infrastructure  Provider  by  means  of  customized  service  level 
agreements. 

CLOUD SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

Security:  Concerns  the  confidentiality,  ease  of  use  and  reliability  of  data  or  information. 
Security may also include  validation and non-repudiation. 
Privacy: Concerns the expression of or devotion to various  legal and non- legal norms  regarding 
the  right  to  private  life.  It  would  be  there  highly  complex  to  map  cloud  issues  onto  the  full 
panoply  of  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  authoritarian  architectures,  the  internationally 
received  privacy principles  give a useful frame: consent,  purpose restriction,  legitimacy, simplicity, 
data security and data subject participation. 
Vulnerability:  According  to  the  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]”Vulnerability  is  the 
possibility  that  a  quality  will  be  unable  to  resist the  actions  of  a  threat  agent.  Vulnerability 
exists  when  there  is  a  differentiation  between  the  energy  being  applied  by  the  threat  agent, 
and  an  object’s  capability  to  oppose  that  strength  so,  vulnerability  should  all  the  time  be 
described in terms of conflict to a certain type of attack”.

Session riding and Hijacking: Session hijacking refers to utilize a valid session key to gain 
unauthorized  access  for  the  information  or  services  residing  on  a  workstation  structure.  It 
refers to stealing of a cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server and it is relevant to

that gives the chance to hackers in order to accomplish a wide variety of malicious activities. 
Session riding delete client data, execute online transactions like bid or orders, sends spam to

opens the firewall [6].

Insecure  Cryptography: Attackers’ can work out any cryptographic system or algorithm as 
main  methods  to  hack  them.  It’s  general  to  find  essential  flaws  in  cryptographic  algorithm 
which can twist strong encryption into feeble encryption or sometimes no encryption at all. 
Data  Protection  and  Portability:  The  cloud  services  are  accessible  based  on  a  contract 
among client and a provider but what will happen when the contract is completed and client 
doesn’t  wants  to  continue  anymore.  Data  security  and  portability  remains  as  one  of  main 
weaknesses of cloud computing. 
Vendor  Lock-in:  This  vulnerability  occurs  due  to  immature  providers  and  new  business 
models  which  raise  the  risk  of  failure  and  going  out  of  the  trade.  Lock  in,  makes  a  client 
dependent on a provider for products and services so they will be unable to deal with another 
provider without substantial switching costs. 
Internet Dependency: Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology where users are 
accessing the services via web browser. What if internet is not accessible? What will happen 
to  user  systems  and  operations,  which  are  very  critical  and  need  to  run  24  hours  such  as 
Healthcare and Banking systems? 
Illegal access to management interface: The cloud feature on-demand, self-service requires 
a management boundary that’s accessible to cloud service users. 
Unauthorized  access  to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant 
vulnerability  for  cloud  systems.  Probability  that  unauthorized  access  could  occur  is  much 
higher than for traditional systems where the management functionality is accessible only to a 
few administrators. 
 

Cloud Threats [1] 

 

(a)  Abuse and Nefarious make use of of Cloud Computing 
(b) Insecure appliance Programming Interfaces 
(c)  Malicious Insiders 
(d) Shared Technology Vulnerabilities 
(e)  Data Loss/Leakage 
(f)  Account, Service & Traffic Hijacking 
(g) Unknown Risk Profile 

 

Abuse  and  Nefarious  Use  of  Cloud  Computing: Spammers,  hackers  and  other  criminals 
take advantage of the convenient listing, simple measures and reasonably unsigned access to 
cloud services to launch different attack. example of such attack consist of: password and key 
cracking;  malicious  data  hosting;  launching  dynamic  attack  points;  building  rainbow 
tables;botnet  command/control;  and  it  basically  targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  and 
Platform as a Service. 
Insecure Application Programming Interfaces: Customers manage and interact with cloud 
services  through  interfaces  or  APIs.  Provider  must  guarantee  that  security  is  included  into 
their  overhaul  model,  although  user  necessity  is  conscious  of  protection  risk  in  the  use, 
implementation,  management,  and  monitoring  of  such  services.  Examples  of  such  risks 
include:  APIs  dependencies;  limited  monitoring  /  logging  capabilities;  inflexible  access 
controls;  anonymous  access;  reusable  tokens/passwords;  clear-text  authentication  and/or 
transmission  of  content;  and  improper  authorizations.  Targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service 
(IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Malicious  Insiders:  Malicious  insiders  cause  a  larger  threat  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  since  clients  do  not  have  a  clear  view  of  supplier  policies  and  actions.  For 
example, employee access, worker monitor, strategy observance and hire values/practice are 
generally  not  transparent  to  customers.  Malicious  insiders  can  achieve  unauthorized  access

Abstract— Cloud computing has been developed to decrease IT expenses and to provide alert IT services to 
human being users as well as organizations. Cloud computing is dynamic in nature; that is elastic, scalable 
and multi-shared with high capability that gives an innovative shape of carrying out business. The estimation 
of cloud computing security impact is difficult for two main reasons. Primary, as is true for many discussions 
about  basic  vocabulary  such  as  "risk,"  "threat,"  and  "vulnerability"  are  often  used  as  if  they  were 
exchangeable,  without  observe  to  their  particular  definition.  Secondary,  not  every  concern  that's  raise  is 
really  particular  to  cloud  computing.  The  important  factor  concerns  are  vulnerabilities.  Cloud  computing

INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing defined  in  Buyya  et  al.  [1] “A  Cloud  is  a  type  of  analogous  and scattered 
system  consisting  of  a  collection  of  inter-connected  and  virtualized  computers  that  are 
dynamically provisioned and presented as one or more unified computing resources based on 
service level agreements established through negotiation between the tune-up supplier”. The 
clients use the elevated excellence networks, application, servers and services  from a public 
pool  of  configurable  computing  capital  [3].  Many  corporations  including  Amazon,  Google, 
SUN,  IBM,  Oracle,  Intel,  HP,  and  Windows  Azure  have  invested  in  cloud  computing  and 
offers  cloud-based  solutions.  There  are  dissimilar  stories  about  what  cloud  computing 
“is”, there is one exact path that virtualization is headed that could bring along with it. Some 
other  harm  for  the  security  industry.  One  matter  to  focal  point  is  cantered  on  vulnerability 
managing and how it is implemented in a cloud environment. Customer’s are faced with the 
requirement  to  scan  their  cloud,  but  unable  to  do  so.  Virtualization  providers  have  been

almost  their  customers  and  hosting  providers  to  adopt  new  infrastructure  to  automate  the 
distribution of CPU processing time for their applications. Across multiple reduced hardware 
devices.  Vulnerability  is  an  important  issue  of  risk.  ISO  27005  defines  risk  as  the  possible 
threat that a given threat will utilize vulnerabilities of a quality or group of assets and thereby 
origin  harm to the grouping   determine  it  in supplies of as one the chance of an occurrence 
and  its  result.  The  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]  for  cloud  computing  and  particularly 
about vulnerabilities is presented in the forth coming paragraphs.  
 

Definitions of cloud computing 

Cloud computing is internet-based computing and latest trend in information technology (IT) 
world.  The  internet  is  frequently  represented  as  a  cloud  and  the  term  “cloud  computing” 
arises  from  that  analogy.  In  brief,  cloud  computing  is  the  dynamic  provisioning  of  IT 
capabilities (hardware, software, or services) from third parties over a network.  
              Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as 
hardware,  development  platforms  and/or  services)  [5].These  property  can  be  energetically 
reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  variable  load  (scale)  allowing  also  for  best  possible  resource 
utilization. This group of resources is typically demoralized by a pay-per-use model in which 
guarantees  are  offered  by  the  Infrastructure  Provider  by  means  of  customized  service  level 
agreements. 

CLOUD SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

Security:  Concerns  the  confidentiality,  ease  of  use  and  reliability  of  data  or  information. 
Security may also include  validation and non-repudiation. 
Privacy: Concerns the expression of or devotion to various  legal and non- legal norms  regarding 
the  right  to  private  life.  It  would  be  there  highly  complex  to  map  cloud  issues  onto  the  full 
panoply  of  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  authoritarian  architectures,  the  internationally 
received  privacy principles  give a useful frame: consent,  purpose restriction,  legitimacy, simplicity, 
data security and data subject participation. 
Vulnerability:  According  to  the  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]”Vulnerability  is  the 
possibility  that  a  quality  will  be  unable  to  resist the  actions  of  a  threat  agent.  Vulnerability 
exists  when  there  is  a  differentiation  between  the  energy  being  applied  by  the  threat  agent, 
and  an  object’s  capability  to  oppose  that  strength  so,  vulnerability  should  all  the  time  be 
described in terms of conflict to a certain type of attack”. 
   

II.  CLOUD CHARACTERISTIC VULNERABILITIES 

Unauthorized  access  to  management  interface: The cloud feature on-demand self-service 
requires a management interface that’s nearby to cloud service users. Unconstitutional access 
to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant  vulnerability  for  cloud 
systems [4]. The probability that unauthorized access could come about is much higher than 
for  time-honoured  systems  where  the  management  functionality  is  reachable  only  to  a  few 
administrator. 
Internet  protocol  vulnerabilities:  The  cloud  characteristic  ever-present  network  access 
means that  cloud services are accessed via  network using standard protocols. In  most  cases, 
this  system  is  the  internet.  Internet  procedure  vulnerabilities  such  as  man-in-the-middle 
attacks are relevant for cloud computing. 
Data recovery vulnerability: The cloud individuality of pooling and flexibility involve that 
resources allocated to one user will be reallocated to a different user at a later time. Memory 
or storage property might be possible to recover data written by a previous user. 
Metering  and  billing  evasion:  The  cloud  feature  to  precise  services  means  that  any  cloud 
service  has  a  capability  at  a  generalization  level  appropriate  to  the  service  type  (such  as 
storage,  processing,  and  active  user  accounts).  Metering  data  used  to  optimize  examine

delivery with bill. Applicable vulnerabilities contain metering and billing data treatment and 
billing elusion. 
 

III.  Cloud Vulnerabilities 

Securely transferring data: Our data can be vulnerable to prying eyes as we hand on it and 
from  the  cloud.  Therefore  we  should  not  shift  important  or  confidential  data  in  an  open 
wireless  network,  in  a  random  public  Wi-Fi  network.  It  is  better to  use  our  home  network, 
and  to  make  sure  encrypting  our  data.  We  must  make  sure  that  our  wireless  router  is 
password-protected.  We  should  ensure  that  the  Web  addresses  of  sites  we  are  visiting  are 
HTTPS rather than simply HTTP. HTTPS sites are encrypted to transfer information safely. 

 

Accessing data: There is nothing worse than trying to recover our information and judgment 
is not presented. Customer wants to know that their data is available when they need.  

Before delegate a cloud provider with our records, we have to assess what sort of undertaking 
they have about uptime when our data is available and consider their track record. Generally 
superior off sticking with honest, big-name providers. 

Data  backup:  Our  data  isn’t  floating  around  in  the  clouds;  it’s  stored on  a  physical  server 
somewhere. So what  happens when there  is a hurricane or a flood or a power failure? Take 
the  time  to  evaluate  our  cloud  provider’s  disaster  recovery  plan  when  we  use  the  cloud  to 
store critical data then have our own backup too. In the privacy globe, they  talk concerning 
organizations  life  form custodian of data and that’s a good way to glance  at it. We  must be 
careful  as  we  are  handing  significant  information  over  to  an  important  person  else.  Ensure 
that our data exist elsewhere whether on an exterior hard drive, on our laptop’s hard drive or 
on a USB drive will give us peace of mind. 

Password  use:  Multiple  instance  of  hacks  and  data  breach  has  exposed  the  passwords  of 
users  of  well-known  websites  and  companies.  These  attacks  also  lean-to  light  on  what  a 
miserable job most of us do in using strong, unique passwords. We should try not to use the 
identical  password  for  all  our  activities  in  the  cloud.  If  we  use  the  similar  password  for  a 
gaming site as we do for our bank account, we place our assets at danger, if that making a bet 
password is cooperation. It is fine carry out to use a password administrator such as Last Pass. 

Privacy: Privacy is important consideration about the information we distribute. For example, 
why provide a phone number to sign up for an email news letter? Take the time to irregularly 
review which  mobile applications and third party services have access to  key accounts such 
as  Facebook  and  Twitter.  Reviewing  the  admission  grants  will  remind  us  to  sever  that 
connection, eliminate any option of utilization or mistreatment. 

Effective cloud securities are:  

 

(a)  BYOD  
(b) Data control  
(c)  Potential data loss  
(d) Enforcing security policies  
(e)  Visibility across all infrastructure resources,  
(f)  Traditional and cloud  
(g) Real-time analysis of log data  
(h) Compliance reporting

IV.  Vulnerabilities and threats architecture of Cloud computing 

In cloud computing users are no longer required to purchase hardware, software or to manage 
storages.  Due  to  the  development  of  this  technology  users  are  required  to  pay  for  cloud 
services on expenditure center. Fresh cloud based models are discussed, and implemented as 
solutions  in  form  of  on-demand  services  that  allows  businesses  to  enhance  their  efficiency 
and scalability. The benefits of cloud computing to various organizations are moving towards 
IT  solutions  that  are  based  on  cloud.  Before  opening  the  trip  to  cloud,  organization  must 
consider the possible threats and vulnerabilities that  may convert their dreams of enhancing 
scalability  and  saving  management  cost  into  a  terrible  of  data  loss  and  misuse.  Based  on 
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and research, NIST [8] have identified top seven threats and 
vulnerabilities that are the causes behind the creation of a Cloud. 

 

Fig1.Cloud Vulnerabilities and Threats architecture 

 

Session riding and Hijacking: Session hijacking refers to utilize a valid session key to gain 
unauthorized  access  for  the  information  or  services  residing  on  a  workstation  structure.  It 
refers to stealing of a cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server and it is relevant to 
web  application  technology.  Weakness  in  the  web  appliance  arrangement  at  their  disposal 
that gives the chance to hackers in order to accomplish a wide variety of malicious activities. 
Session riding delete client data, execute online transactions like bid or orders, sends spam to 
an intranet scheme via internet and changes system as well as network configurations or even 
opens the firewall [6]. 
Virtual  Machine  Escape: Cloud computing servers use the matching OS, venture and web 
applications as contained VMs and physical servers. The capacity for an attacker or malware 
to  slightly  exploit  vulnerabilities  in  these  systems  and  applications  is  a  significant  threat to 
virtualized cloud computing environments [6]. 
Reliability  and  Availability  of  Service  [5]:  In  terms  of  dependability  and  accessibility, 
cloud computing is not a wonderful technology. With more services organism built on top of 
cloud  computing  infrastructures,  an  outage  or  breakdown  can  create  a  domino  effect  by 
taking  down  large  amounts  of  internet  based  services  and  applications  which  raise  several 
questions such as in cases of failure, what forms of completion exist for stakeholders? What 
the liability of cloud provider? What will be suitable events to conquer these issues?

Dr.P.K.Rai et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.2, February- 2014, pg. 490-496 

Insecure  Cryptography: Attackers’ can work out any cryptographic system or algorithm as 
main  methods  to  hack  them.  It’s  general  to  find  essential  flaws  in  cryptographic  algorithm 
which can twist strong encryption into feeble encryption or sometimes no encryption at all. 
Data  Protection  and  Portability:  The  cloud  services  are  accessible  based  on  a  contract 
among client and a provider but what will happen when the contract is completed and client 
doesn’t  wants  to  continue  anymore.  Data  security  and  portability  remains  as  one  of  main 
weaknesses of cloud computing. 
Vendor  Lock-in:  This  vulnerability  occurs  due  to  immature  providers  and  new  business 
models  which  raise  the  risk  of  failure  and  going  out  of  the  trade.  Lock  in,  makes  a  client 
dependent on a provider for products and services so they will be unable to deal with another 
provider without substantial switching costs. 
Internet Dependency: Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology where users are 
accessing the services via web browser. What if internet is not accessible? What will happen 
to  user  systems  and  operations,  which  are  very  critical  and  need  to  run  24  hours  such  as 
Healthcare and Banking systems? 
Illegal access to management interface: The cloud feature on-demand, self-service requires 
a management boundary that’s accessible to cloud service users. 
Unauthorized  access  to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant 
vulnerability  for  cloud  systems.  Probability  that  unauthorized  access  could  occur  is  much 
higher than for traditional systems where the management functionality is accessible only to a 
few administrators. 
 

Cloud Threats [1] 

 

(a)  Abuse and Nefarious make use of of Cloud Computing 
(b) Insecure appliance Programming Interfaces 
(c)  Malicious Insiders 
(d) Shared Technology Vulnerabilities 
(e)  Data Loss/Leakage 
(f)  Account, Service & Traffic Hijacking 
(g) Unknown Risk Profile 

 

Abuse  and  Nefarious  Use  of  Cloud  Computing: Spammers,  hackers  and  other  criminals 
take advantage of the convenient listing, simple measures and reasonably unsigned access to 
cloud services to launch different attack. example of such attack consist of: password and key 
cracking;  malicious  data  hosting;  launching  dynamic  attack  points;  building  rainbow 
tables;botnet  command/control;  and  it  basically  targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  and 
Platform as a Service. 
Insecure Application Programming Interfaces: Customers manage and interact with cloud 
services  through  interfaces  or  APIs.  Provider  must  guarantee  that  security  is  included  into 
their  overhaul  model,  although  user  necessity  is  conscious  of  protection  risk  in  the  use, 
implementation,  management,  and  monitoring  of  such  services.  Examples  of  such  risks 
include:  APIs  dependencies;  limited  monitoring  /  logging  capabilities;  inflexible  access 
controls;  anonymous  access;  reusable  tokens/passwords;  clear-text  authentication  and/or 
transmission  of  content;  and  improper  authorizations.  Targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service 
(IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Malicious  Insiders:  Malicious  insiders  cause  a  larger  threat  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  since  clients  do  not  have  a  clear  view  of  supplier  policies  and  actions.  For 
example, employee access, worker monitor, strategy observance and hire values/practice are 
generally  not  transparent  to  customers.  Malicious  insiders  can  achieve  unauthorized  access

into organizations  and  their  resources.  Some  threats  contain  product  injure,  economic  force 
and  defeat  of  production.  Targets:  IaaS  (Infrastructure  as  a  Service),  PaaS  (Platform  as  a 
Service), SaaS (Software as a Service). 
Shared  Technology  Vulnerabilities:  IaaS  is  based  on  shared  infrastructure  (e.g.  disk 
partitions, CPU caches etc.), which is habitually not intended to accommodate a multi-tenant 
architecture.  Without  being  seen  flaws  have  allowed  guest  operating  systems  to  gain 
unauthorized levels of control and/or influence on the platform.  Targets: IaaS (Infrastructure 
as a Service). 
 
Data  Loss/Leakage:  Compromised  data  may  include:  deleted  or  altered  data  without  first 
making  a  backup;  unlinking  a  record  from  a  larger  context;  loss  of  an  encoding  key;  and 
unauthorized access of sensitive data. The option of data compromise significantly increases 
in  cloud  computing  caused  by  the  structural  design  and  operation.  For  instances  of  data 
loss/leakage  issues  include:  insufficient  authentication,  authorization  and  audit  (AAA) 
controls;  inconsistent  encryption;  inconsistent  software  keys;  operational  failures;  disposal 
challenges;  risk  of  association;  jurisdiction/political  issues;  persistence  and  eminence 
challenges;  data  center  reliability;  and  disaster  recovery.  Targets:  PaaS  (Platform  as  a 
Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). 
Account,  Service  &  Traffic  Hijacking: Account or service hijacking is usually carried out 
with  stolen  identification.  Attacks  include  phishing,  scheme  and  development  of  software 
vulnerabilities.  Using  stolen  ID,  attackers  can  access  critical  areas  of  cloud  computing 
services  and  compromise  confidently,  integrity,  and  availability  (CIA)  of  such  services. 
Example  of  such  attacks  includes  eavesdropping  on  transactions/sensitive  activities, 
manipulation of data, returning flimsy information, redirection to dishonest sites.  
Unknown  Risk  Profile:  Cloud  services  mean  that  organizations  are  less  involved  with 
hardware  and  software  ownership  and  maintenance.  These  offer  important  advantages, 
organizations  should  be  aware  that  issues  such  as  internal  safety  events,  security 
acquiescence,  and  configuration  harden;  patching,  auditing  and  logging  may  not  be 
overlooked.  

V.  CONCLUSIONS

contains threats and  vulnerabilities. Cloud computing  has an  energetic nature that is elastic, 
scalable  and  multi-shared  with  high  capacity  that  gives  an  innovative  shape  of  carrying  out 
business. As the development of cloud computing, issue of security has become a top priority.

distribution of CPU processing time for their applications. Across multiple reduced hardware 
devices.  Vulnerability  is  an  important  issue  of  risk.  ISO  27005  defines  risk  as  the  possible 
threat that a given threat will utilize vulnerabilities of a quality or group of assets and thereby 
origin  harm to the grouping   determine  it  in supplies of as one the chance of an occurrence 
and  its  result.  The  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]  for  cloud  computing  and  particularly 
about vulnerabilities is presented in the forth coming paragraphs.  
 

Definitions of cloud computing 

Cloud computing is internet-based computing and latest trend in information technology (IT) 
world.  The  internet  is  frequently  represented  as  a  cloud  and  the  term  “cloud  computing” 
arises  from  that  analogy.  In  brief,  cloud  computing  is  the  dynamic  provisioning  of  IT 
capabilities (hardware, software, or services) from third parties over a network.  
              Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as 
hardware,  development  platforms  and/or  services)  [5].These  property  can  be  energetically 
reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  variable  load  (scale)  allowing  also  for  best  possible  resource 
utilization. This group of resources is typically demoralized by a pay-per-use model in which 
guarantees  are  offered  by  the  Infrastructure  Provider  by  means  of  customized  service  level 
agreements. 

CLOUD SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

Security:  Concerns  the  confidentiality,  ease  of  use  and  reliability  of  data  or  information. 
Security may also include  validation and non-repudiation. 
Privacy: Concerns the expression of or devotion to various  legal and non- legal norms  regarding 
the  right  to  private  life.  It  would  be  there  highly  complex  to  map  cloud  issues  onto  the  full 
panoply  of  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  authoritarian  architectures,  the  internationally 
received  privacy principles  give a useful frame: consent,  purpose restriction,  legitimacy, simplicity, 
data security and data subject participation. 
Vulnerability:  According  to  the  Open  Group’s  risk  taxonomy  [10]”Vulnerability  is  the 
possibility  that  a  quality  will  be  unable  to  resist the  actions  of  a  threat  agent.  Vulnerability 
exists  when  there  is  a  differentiation  between  the  energy  being  applied  by  the  threat  agent, 
and  an  object’s  capability  to  oppose  that  strength  so,  vulnerability  should  all  the  time  be 
described in terms of conflict to a certain type of attack”. 
   

II.  CLOUD CHARACTERISTIC VULNERABILITIES 

Unauthorized  access  to  management  interface: The cloud feature on-demand self-service 
requires a management interface that’s nearby to cloud service users. Unconstitutional access 
to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant  vulnerability  for  cloud 
systems [4]. The probability that unauthorized access could come about is much higher than 
for  time-honoured  systems  where  the  management  functionality  is  reachable  only  to  a  few 
administrator. 
Internet  protocol  vulnerabilities:  The  cloud  characteristic  ever-present  network  access 
means that  cloud services are accessed via  network using standard protocols. In  most  cases, 
this  system  is  the  internet.  Internet  procedure  vulnerabilities  such  as  man-in-the-middle 
attacks are relevant for cloud computing. 
Data recovery vulnerability: The cloud individuality of pooling and flexibility involve that 
resources allocated to one user will be reallocated to a different user at a later time. Memory 
or storage property might be possible to recover data written by a previous user. 
Metering  and  billing  evasion:  The  cloud  feature  to  precise  services  means  that  any  cloud 
service  has  a  capability  at  a  generalization  level  appropriate  to  the  service  type  (such  as 
storage,  processing,  and  active  user  accounts).  Metering  data  used  to  optimize  examine

delivery with bill. Applicable vulnerabilities contain metering and billing data treatment and 
billing elusion. 
 

III.  Cloud Vulnerabilities 

Securely transferring data: Our data can be vulnerable to prying eyes as we hand on it and 
from  the  cloud.  Therefore  we  should  not  shift  important  or  confidential  data  in  an  open 
wireless  network,  in  a  random  public  Wi-Fi  network.  It  is  better to  use  our  home  network, 
and  to  make  sure  encrypting  our  data.  We  must  make  sure  that  our  wireless  router  is 
password-protected.  We  should  ensure  that  the  Web  addresses  of  sites  we  are  visiting  are 
HTTPS rather than simply HTTP. HTTPS sites are encrypted to transfer information safely. 

 

Accessing data: There is nothing worse than trying to recover our information and judgment 
is not presented. Customer wants to know that their data is available when they need.  

Before delegate a cloud provider with our records, we have to assess what sort of undertaking 
they have about uptime when our data is available and consider their track record. Generally 
superior off sticking with honest, big-name providers. 

Data  backup:  Our  data  isn’t  floating  around  in  the  clouds;  it’s  stored on  a  physical  server 
somewhere. So what  happens when there  is a hurricane or a flood or a power failure? Take 
the  time  to  evaluate  our  cloud  provider’s  disaster  recovery  plan  when  we  use  the  cloud  to 
store critical data then have our own backup too. In the privacy globe, they  talk concerning 
organizations  life  form custodian of data and that’s a good way to glance  at it. We  must be 
careful  as  we  are  handing  significant  information  over  to  an  important  person  else.  Ensure 
that our data exist elsewhere whether on an exterior hard drive, on our laptop’s hard drive or 
on a USB drive will give us peace of mind. 

Password  use:  Multiple  instance  of  hacks  and  data  breach  has  exposed  the  passwords  of 
users  of  well-known  websites  and  companies.  These  attacks  also  lean-to  light  on  what  a 
miserable job most of us do in using strong, unique passwords. We should try not to use the 
identical  password  for  all  our  activities  in  the  cloud.  If  we  use  the  similar  password  for  a 
gaming site as we do for our bank account, we place our assets at danger, if that making a bet 
password is cooperation. It is fine carry out to use a password administrator such as Last Pass. 

Privacy: Privacy is important consideration about the information we distribute. For example, 
why provide a phone number to sign up for an email news letter? Take the time to irregularly 
review which  mobile applications and third party services have access to  key accounts such 
as  Facebook  and  Twitter.  Reviewing  the  admission  grants  will  remind  us  to  sever  that 
connection, eliminate any option of utilization or mistreatment. 

Effective cloud securities are:  

 

(a)  BYOD  
(b) Data control  
(c)  Potential data loss  
(d) Enforcing security policies  
(e)  Visibility across all infrastructure resources,  
(f)  Traditional and cloud  
(g) Real-time analysis of log data  
(h) Compliance reporting

IV.  Vulnerabilities and threats architecture of Cloud computing 

In cloud computing users are no longer required to purchase hardware, software or to manage 
storages.  Due  to  the  development  of  this  technology  users  are  required  to  pay  for  cloud 
services on expenditure center. Fresh cloud based models are discussed, and implemented as 
solutions  in  form  of  on-demand  services  that  allows  businesses  to  enhance  their  efficiency 
and scalability. The benefits of cloud computing to various organizations are moving towards 
IT  solutions  that  are  based  on  cloud.  Before  opening  the  trip  to  cloud,  organization  must 
consider the possible threats and vulnerabilities that  may convert their dreams of enhancing 
scalability  and  saving  management  cost  into  a  terrible  of  data  loss  and  misuse.  Based  on 
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and research, NIST [8] have identified top seven threats and 
vulnerabilities that are the causes behind the creation of a Cloud.

Session riding and Hijacking: Session hijacking refers to utilize a valid session key to gain 
unauthorized  access  for  the  information  or  services  residing  on  a  workstation  structure.  It 
refers to stealing of a cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server and it is relevant to 
web  application  technology.  Weakness  in  the  web  appliance  arrangement  at  their  disposal 
that gives the chance to hackers in order to accomplish a wide variety of malicious activities. 
Session riding delete client data, execute online transactions like bid or orders, sends spam to 
an intranet scheme via internet and changes system as well as network configurations or even 
opens the firewall [6]. 
Virtual  Machine  Escape: Cloud computing servers use the matching OS, venture and web 
applications as contained VMs and physical servers. The capacity for an attacker or malware 
to  slightly  exploit  vulnerabilities  in  these  systems  and  applications  is  a  significant  threat to 
virtualized cloud computing environments [6]. 
Reliability  and  Availability  of  Service  [5]:  In  terms  of  dependability  and  accessibility, 
cloud computing is not a wonderful technology. With more services organism built on top of 
cloud  computing  infrastructures,  an  outage  or  breakdown  can  create  a  domino  effect  by 
taking  down  large  amounts  of  internet  based  services  and  applications  which  raise  several 
questions such as in cases of failure, what forms of completion exist for stakeholders? What 
the liability of cloud provider? What will be suitable events to conquer these issues?

Dr.P.K.Rai et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.2, February- 2014, pg. 490-496 

Insecure  Cryptography: Attackers’ can work out any cryptographic system or algorithm as 
main  methods  to  hack  them.  It’s  general  to  find  essential  flaws  in  cryptographic  algorithm 
which can twist strong encryption into feeble encryption or sometimes no encryption at all. 
Data  Protection  and  Portability:  The  cloud  services  are  accessible  based  on  a  contract 
among client and a provider but what will happen when the contract is completed and client 
doesn’t  wants  to  continue  anymore.  Data  security  and  portability  remains  as  one  of  main 
weaknesses of cloud computing. 
Vendor  Lock-in:  This  vulnerability  occurs  due  to  immature  providers  and  new  business 
models  which  raise  the  risk  of  failure  and  going  out  of  the  trade.  Lock  in,  makes  a  client 
dependent on a provider for products and services so they will be unable to deal with another 
provider without substantial switching costs. 
Internet Dependency: Cloud computing is an internet dependent technology where users are 
accessing the services via web browser. What if internet is not accessible? What will happen 
to  user  systems  and  operations,  which  are  very  critical  and  need  to  run  24  hours  such  as 
Healthcare and Banking systems? 
Illegal access to management interface: The cloud feature on-demand, self-service requires 
a management boundary that’s accessible to cloud service users. 
Unauthorized  access  to  the  management  interface  is  therefore  a  particularly  relevant 
vulnerability  for  cloud  systems.  Probability  that  unauthorized  access  could  occur  is  much 
higher than for traditional systems where the management functionality is accessible only to a 
few administrators. 
 

Cloud Threats [1] 

 

(a)  Abuse and Nefarious make use of of Cloud Computing 
(b) Insecure appliance Programming Interfaces 
(c)  Malicious Insiders 
(d) Shared Technology Vulnerabilities 
(e)  Data Loss/Leakage 
(f)  Account, Service & Traffic Hijacking 
(g) Unknown Risk Profile 

 

Abuse  and  Nefarious  Use  of  Cloud  Computing: Spammers,  hackers  and  other  criminals 
take advantage of the convenient listing, simple measures and reasonably unsigned access to 
cloud services to launch different attack. example of such attack consist of: password and key 
cracking;  malicious  data  hosting;  launching  dynamic  attack  points;  building  rainbow 
tables;botnet  command/control;  and  it  basically  targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  and 
Platform as a Service. 
Insecure Application Programming Interfaces: Customers manage and interact with cloud 
services  through  interfaces  or  APIs.  Provider  must  guarantee  that  security  is  included  into 
their  overhaul  model,  although  user  necessity  is  conscious  of  protection  risk  in  the  use, 
implementation,  management,  and  monitoring  of  such  services.  Examples  of  such  risks 
include:  APIs  dependencies;  limited  monitoring  /  logging  capabilities;  inflexible  access 
controls;  anonymous  access;  reusable  tokens/passwords;  clear-text  authentication  and/or 
transmission  of  content;  and  improper  authorizations.  Targets:  Infrastructure  as  a  Service 
(IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Malicious  Insiders:  Malicious  insiders  cause  a  larger  threat  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  since  clients  do  not  have  a  clear  view  of  supplier  policies  and  actions.  For 
example, employee access, worker monitor, strategy observance and hire values/practice are 
generally  not  transparent  to  customers.  Malicious  insiders  can  achieve  unauthorized  access

into organizations  and  their  resources.  Some  threats  contain  product  injure,  economic  force 
and  defeat  of  production.  Targets:  IaaS  (Infrastructure  as  a  Service),  PaaS  (Platform  as  a 
Service), SaaS (Software as a Service). 
Shared  Technology  Vulnerabilities:  IaaS  is  based  on  shared  infrastructure  (e.g.  disk 
partitions, CPU caches etc.), which is habitually not intended to accommodate a multi-tenant 
architecture.  Without  being  seen  flaws  have  allowed  guest  operating  systems  to  gain 
unauthorized levels of control and/or influence on the platform.  Targets: IaaS (Infrastructure 
as a Service). 
 
Data  Loss/Leakage:  Compromised  data  may  include:  deleted  or  altered  data  without  first 
making  a  backup;  unlinking  a  record  from  a  larger  context;  loss  of  an  encoding  key;  and 
unauthorized access of sensitive data. The option of data compromise significantly increases 
in  cloud  computing  caused  by  the  structural  design  and  operation.  For  instances  of  data 
loss/leakage  issues  include:  insufficient  authentication,  authorization  and  audit  (AAA) 
controls;  inconsistent  encryption;  inconsistent  software  keys;  operational  failures;  disposal 
challenges;  risk  of  association;  jurisdiction/political  issues;  persistence  and  eminence 
challenges;  data  center  reliability;  and  disaster  recovery.  Targets:  PaaS  (Platform  as  a 
Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). 
Account,  Service  &  Traffic  Hijacking: Account or service hijacking is usually carried out 
with  stolen  identification.  Attacks  include  phishing,  scheme  and  development  of  software 
vulnerabilities.  Using  stolen  ID,  attackers  can  access  critical  areas  of  cloud  computing 
services  and  compromise  confidently,  integrity,  and  availability  (CIA)  of  such  services. 
Example  of  such  attacks  includes  eavesdropping  on  transactions/sensitive  activities, 
manipulation of data, returning flimsy information, redirection to dishonest sites.  
Unknown  Risk  Profile:  Cloud  services  mean  that  organizations  are  less  involved  with 
hardware  and  software  ownership  and  maintenance.  These  offer  important  advantages, 
organizations  should  be  aware  that  issues  such  as  internal  safety  events,  security 
acquiescence,  and  configuration  harden;  patching,  auditing  and  logging  may  not  be 
overlooked.
