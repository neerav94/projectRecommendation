II.  CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL 

In  cloud  computing  almost  every  things  being  delivers  as  a  Services  from  access  to  security.    The  cloud  is 

conflagration of buzzwords “as a Service” [3]. There are three types of services which are very special ongoing days. 
 
A.  Software as a Service 

Its means to deliver the various types of software’s on internet as a services. It is comes in reality around in early 
2001 when it was referred as Application as a service [3]. In SaaS model, the user buys a subscription to some software 
product  and  services  but  these  data  and  code  available  on remote  server and  customer  can access  to  this  services  via 
Internet [8]. It provides the computation power in the form of software services on cloud multiple clients.  Clients can 
use  the  various  applications  on  cloud  but  cloud  users  doesn’t  have  right  to  manage  them.    Ex.  Google,  salesforce, 
Microsoft and Zoho etc. 
 
B.  Platform as a Service 

Its gives  chance  and  flexibility  to  build,  develop,  test and  deploy  an application  on  service  provider’s machine  or 
platform whether it’s API, Storage or Infrastructure [3].  The freedom provided to the customer to create and acquire an 
application  created  using  either  different  programming languages  or  tools  supported  by  the provider  [10].  Customers 
get access to the platform by enabling them to organize their own software and application in the cloud [4].  It reduces 
the  cost  and  complexity  of  buying,  housing  and  managing  hardware  and  software  components  as  a  platform  to  the 
clients  [5].  Service  providers  are  only  responsible  for  integrity  and  availability  of  their  services  where  as  the  users 
responsible  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  [8].  Ex.  WAMP  (Windows,  Apache,  MySql,  and  PHP)  LAMP(Linux, 
Apache, MySql, and PHP) 
 
C.  Infrastructure as a Service 

SaaS  and  PaaS  are  providing  application  to  customers  where  as  IaaS  simply  offer  hardware  support  to  customer 
where they can put whatever they want onto it [8]. It offers access to various fundamental resources such as available in 
the  form  of  networks,  servers,  storage  devices,  computational  resources  and  many  more.  The  clients  doesn’t  have 
authority to manage these fundamental resources over the cloud, users can just used them [4]. Ex. Amazon, GoGrid and 
3tera. 

 

III. SECURITY ISSUES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING 

The security means to protect and get secure from unauthorized access, uses, disclosure, disruption, modification, 
perusal,  inspection,  recording  or  destruction  [1].  Cloud  computing  has  grown  rapidly  in  various  aspects  including 
services,  architecture,  computing  and  storage  due  the  utility  of  such  things  the  security  issues  can  be  viewed  as 
problems.  
 
A.  Account or Service Hijacking: 

Hijacking refers to get complete control over others account and it is not new to the today’s  world but the attacks 
like  phishing,  fraud  and  exploitation  of  software  are  need  to  avoid  [1].  If  any  intruders  get  an  access  to  any  other 
account then security of account is lapsed completely and activities like deletion, updating data, and manipulation with 
account data create lots of burden to its account holder as well as the manger (cloud). The person who is carried out 
such things beings identified by the name of Intruder or Hacker. And it has been observed that mostly hacker will take 
an  advantages  of  silly  mistakes  performed  by  cloud  users  such  an  not  proper  log  off  of  service  windows,  allows 
additional plug ins even they are not be a part of cloud services, access illegal sites simultaneously with using on cloud 
services, share and distribute financial and personal information to other people etc. 
 
B.  Unknown Risk Profile:  

Information about who is sharing infrastructure may be relevant in addition to network instruction logs, redirection 
attempts and other logs, but low effort of security may be it can result in unknown exposures [3]. To track the unknown 
profile is tedious job. So its responsibility of cloud providers to verify every users before to allow them to be a part of 
cloud  and  for  that  cloud  providers  may  used  telephone  versification,  email  verification,  or  social  network  account 
verification  and  if  cloud  services  related  to  financial  sector  then  cloud  providers  may  refer  his  banking  or  financial

information as well. It will not give guaranty to stop all fraud but at least it restricts someone. Due to this cloud contain 
unethical and uncontrolled account which generate misbehave on cloud.  
 
C.   Shared Technology Issues: 

IaaS deliver the service of sharable infrastructure between multiple users.  The underlying components such as CPU 
and  Memory  were  not  designed  to  offer  strong  isolation  properties.  To  address  this  gap  a  virtualization  hyper  visor 
between  guest  operating  system  and  the  physical  compute  resources  [3].  Strong  compartmentalization  must  be 
implemented to avoid the access and control over the sharable infrastructure and the individual customers should not 
impact on other customers operation.  
 
D.  Architecture of Cloud Server: 

The actual location of the infrastructure such as computing servers, Data servers, Hardware’s is determined  by the 
cloud service provider. The implementation of reliability, scalability logic and virtual machines (VM) typically to serve 
as the abstract unit of deployment and are loosely coupled with the cloud storage architecture [5]. A VM or hypervisor 
is the additional layer between Operating system and Hardware and sometimes these supports to take control over the 
administrative  operations  like  migration,  launching  and  end  up  the  process  of  VM  objects.  If  any  individual  get 
command over the other’s VM object then it will create a major problem.  

 
E.   Identity Management: 

The proper identity of customer will help to manage the uniqueness of each user and to carry  out such things the 
different levels  of  user  authentication  and  validation  schemes  being  implemented  in  cloud  but  still  the  access  control 
will create a threat. Apart from authentication the identity management should have control over the user’s privileges 
and access to required resources [5]. Cloud should have capability to formulate and maintain user privileges about its 
access and task that user will performs on cloud as a part of identity management [5]. 
 
F.  Insecure Interface and API: 

The  cloud  providers  deliver  the  cloud  services  via  different  interfaces  and  API  where  customers have  freedom  to 
choose interface and interact with cloud services. It’s been observed that the security and availability of general cloud 
services is dependent on the security of interfaces and API [1]. Some time cloud users share their interface and API to 
access the cloud services and due to the week knowledge of security aspects, users will allow to such interfaces to store 
and  use  their  personal  information  in  the  form  of  remember  password,  transaction  history,  scripts,  cookies  and 
additional plug inns. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that interface 
need  only  meaningful  information  of  users  to  provide  access  to  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user’s  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, scripts, transaction history even user wishes to do it.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL 

In  cloud  computing  almost  every  things  being  delivers  as  a  Services  from  access  to  security.    The  cloud  is 

conflagration of buzzwords “as a Service” [3]. There are three types of services which are very special ongoing days. 
 
A.  Software as a Service 

Its means to deliver the various types of software’s on internet as a services. It is comes in reality around in early 
2001 when it was referred as Application as a service [3]. In SaaS model, the user buys a subscription to some software 
product  and  services  but  these  data  and  code  available  on remote  server and  customer  can access  to  this  services  via 
Internet [8]. It provides the computation power in the form of software services on cloud multiple clients.  Clients can 
use  the  various  applications  on  cloud  but  cloud  users  doesn’t  have  right  to  manage  them.    Ex.  Google,  salesforce, 
Microsoft and Zoho etc. 
 
B.  Platform as a Service 

Its gives  chance  and  flexibility  to  build,  develop,  test and  deploy  an application  on  service  provider’s machine  or 
platform whether it’s API, Storage or Infrastructure [3].  The freedom provided to the customer to create and acquire an 
application  created  using  either  different  programming languages  or  tools  supported  by  the provider  [10].  Customers 
get access to the platform by enabling them to organize their own software and application in the cloud [4].  It reduces 
the  cost  and  complexity  of  buying,  housing  and  managing  hardware  and  software  components  as  a  platform  to  the 
clients  [5].  Service  providers  are  only  responsible  for  integrity  and  availability  of  their  services  where  as  the  users 
responsible  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  [8].  Ex.  WAMP  (Windows,  Apache,  MySql,  and  PHP)  LAMP(Linux, 
Apache, MySql, and PHP) 
 
C.  Infrastructure as a Service 

SaaS  and  PaaS  are  providing  application  to  customers  where  as  IaaS  simply  offer  hardware  support  to  customer 
where they can put whatever they want onto it [8]. It offers access to various fundamental resources such as available in 
the  form  of  networks,  servers,  storage  devices,  computational  resources  and  many  more.  The  clients  doesn’t  have 
authority to manage these fundamental resources over the cloud, users can just used them [4]. Ex. Amazon, GoGrid and 
3tera. 

 

III. SECURITY ISSUES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING 

The security means to protect and get secure from unauthorized access, uses, disclosure, disruption, modification, 
perusal,  inspection,  recording  or  destruction  [1].  Cloud  computing  has  grown  rapidly  in  various  aspects  including 
services,  architecture,  computing  and  storage  due  the  utility  of  such  things  the  security  issues  can  be  viewed  as 
problems.  
 
A.  Account or Service Hijacking: 

Hijacking refers to get complete control over others account and it is not new to the today’s  world but the attacks 
like  phishing,  fraud  and  exploitation  of  software  are  need  to  avoid  [1].  If  any  intruders  get  an  access  to  any  other 
account then security of account is lapsed completely and activities like deletion, updating data, and manipulation with 
account data create lots of burden to its account holder as well as the manger (cloud). The person who is carried out 
such things beings identified by the name of Intruder or Hacker. And it has been observed that mostly hacker will take 
an  advantages  of  silly  mistakes  performed  by  cloud  users  such  an  not  proper  log  off  of  service  windows,  allows 
additional plug ins even they are not be a part of cloud services, access illegal sites simultaneously with using on cloud 
services, share and distribute financial and personal information to other people etc. 
 
B.  Unknown Risk Profile:  

Information about who is sharing infrastructure may be relevant in addition to network instruction logs, redirection 
attempts and other logs, but low effort of security may be it can result in unknown exposures [3]. To track the unknown 
profile is tedious job. So its responsibility of cloud providers to verify every users before to allow them to be a part of 
cloud  and  for  that  cloud  providers  may  used  telephone  versification,  email  verification,  or  social  network  account 
verification  and  if  cloud  services  related  to  financial  sector  then  cloud  providers  may  refer  his  banking  or  financial

Anup Date et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 528-534 

information as well. It will not give guaranty to stop all fraud but at least it restricts someone. Due to this cloud contain 
unethical and uncontrolled account which generate misbehave on cloud.  
 
C.   Shared Technology Issues: 

IaaS deliver the service of sharable infrastructure between multiple users.  The underlying components such as CPU 
and  Memory  were  not  designed  to  offer  strong  isolation  properties.  To  address  this  gap  a  virtualization  hyper  visor 
between  guest  operating  system  and  the  physical  compute  resources  [3].  Strong  compartmentalization  must  be 
implemented to avoid the access and control over the sharable infrastructure and the individual customers should not 
impact on other customers operation.  
 
D.  Architecture of Cloud Server: 

The actual location of the infrastructure such as computing servers, Data servers, Hardware’s is determined  by the 
cloud service provider. The implementation of reliability, scalability logic and virtual machines (VM) typically to serve 
as the abstract unit of deployment and are loosely coupled with the cloud storage architecture [5]. A VM or hypervisor 
is the additional layer between Operating system and Hardware and sometimes these supports to take control over the 
administrative  operations  like  migration,  launching  and  end  up  the  process  of  VM  objects.  If  any  individual  get 
command over the other’s VM object then it will create a major problem.  

 
E.   Identity Management: 

The proper identity of customer will help to manage the uniqueness of each user and to carry  out such things the 
different levels  of  user  authentication  and  validation  schemes  being  implemented  in  cloud  but  still  the  access  control 
will create a threat. Apart from authentication the identity management should have control over the user’s privileges 
and access to required resources [5]. Cloud should have capability to formulate and maintain user privileges about its 
access and task that user will performs on cloud as a part of identity management [5]. 
 
F.  Insecure Interface and API: 

The  cloud  providers  deliver  the  cloud  services  via  different  interfaces  and  API  where  customers have  freedom  to 
choose interface and interact with cloud services. It’s been observed that the security and availability of general cloud 
services is dependent on the security of interfaces and API [1]. Some time cloud users share their interface and API to 
access the cloud services and due to the week knowledge of security aspects, users will allow to such interfaces to store 
and  use  their  personal  information  in  the  form  of  remember  password,  transaction  history,  scripts,  cookies  and 
additional plug inns. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that interface 
need  only  meaningful  information  of  users  to  provide  access  to  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user’s  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, scripts, transaction history even user wishes to do it.

Anup Date et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 528-534 

Above figure shows the essential security components such as 
 
A.  Authentication:  

To provide authenticated access to cloud is the major issue in the cloud environment. To manage this problem there 
is  need  individually  verification  and  validation.  Authentication  is  one  of  the  process  that  keep  data  away  from 
unauthorized  users and  it  typically  identity-based,  which  makes  authentication  of  the user’s  identity  [5].  When  cloud 
users logon to their accounts the Authentication system get activated and identify whether user if genuine user or not 
[2]. For authentication usernames and passwords are used to access the cloud.    
 
B.  Authorization:  

It is a process  where privileges are allocated to cloud users as per their login status and role they  want to play on 
cloud.  Sometime  User  authentication  and  chosen  service  on  cloud  will  decide  the  privileges  for  customers  and 
according to that user authorization gets a shape. As per the norms of authority the customer can do and manage the 
things on cloud. The Authorizations will decide what operation and task will execute by user. 
 
C.  Confidentiality of user:  

It  refers  only  right  user  get  command  and  access  over  the  things  in  cloud.  It  specifies  that  the  genuine  customer 

should get the access to the resources like computation, infrastructure, data storage and application handling.  
 
 
D.  Availability of resources at location:  

It  indicates  that  all  resources  whether  they  are  logical  or  fundamental  they  should  make  available  to  respective 
customer  wherever  and  whenever  they  needed.  Only  authenticated  and  authorized  user  should  get  access  of  the 
resources. 
 
E.  Integrity of Data:   

It is responsibility of cloud server to maintain the accurate computing of data that comes from integration of various 
files  and  deliver  it  within  specified  time.  While  performing  this  operation  the  cloud  should  make  sure  that  there  I 
provision  for  error  during  computing.  Also  there  should  be  some  mechanism  that  can  assure  the  customers  that 
whatever  data  will  be  stored  on  the  files  servers  will not hampering any  other  data  elements  [1].  Additionally  it  also 
specify to  protect  cloud  data  and  applications from  unauthorized  deletion,  modification,  theft, falsehood or abused 
[2].  Integrity  may  come  from  the  accuracy,  Isolation,  Atomicity,  completeness,  availability,  Consistency,  and 
Durability of a data.   
 
F.  Harmful Attacks:  

An  attack  can  happen  in  several  ways  on  cloud  and  every  attacker  come  to  spoil  the  things  on  cloud.  Someone 
randomly  create  a threat  on  cloud  and  someone  do  it  by  specific  intention.  These  attacker  either  come  to  collect  the 
valuable  data  present  on  cloud  or  to  disturb  the  behaviour  of  cloud  by  introducing  the  spoiling  agents  like  virus, 
malwares  etc.  These  attacks  may  follow  then  Unethical  Browsing  and  wrapping  of  data.  Wrapping  of  data  means 
attacker wrap the communication between two people in such a way that the individual feels that the data comes from 
original sources but actually it’s being designed by attacker not by original source.  Unethical Browsing means where 
bad actions being happens such as phishing, spoofing, alteration of browser certificates etc [2].  
 
G.  Concerning Risk Area:  

It  specifies  the  things  related  to  access  control,  Monitoring  of  data,  changing  of  data  format  (encryption  and 
decryption), data  isolation and  many  more.   It  exposes  the new  era  of  concerning risk.  Data  Isolation,  Data recovery 
and data location is one of them.  Data isolation means every individual will enjoy the separate copy data elements like 
maintain  by  any  database.  Data  Recovery  is  ability  to  restore  and  recover  the  data  if  a  disaster  occurred  [2].  Data 
location is nothing but the data should maintain and store in the same geographical regions where user belonged i.e if 
any user comes from India and its data should manage and store in the same territory so data will not be spread to some 
another one because norms and regulation may violet according to the territory.

Abstract—  Cloud  computing  is  a  model  of  information  computing,  storage,  delivery  of  services  and  sharing 
infrastructure resources provided to clients on their demand.  Instead of purchasing actual physical devices servers, 
storage,  or  any  networking  equipment,  customer  used  these  resources  from  a  cloud  provider  as  an  outsourced 
service. It defined as ―a model of management of information, resources and applications as services over Internet 
as per requirement of clients‖.   Cloud  computing  is  a approach to convenient  and    on demand network access to  
a  shared group  of computing  resources  that  can  be provided by service  provider in the form of multiple services.   
It introduces a new Internet-based environment for on-demand access, dynamic provision for computing resources 
by using various type services on cloud. These models are referred as Software as a Service, Platform as a Service 
and Infrastructure as a Service.  Just because of that it is tough to manage the  security  and  privacy problems in 
cloud caused  by  its  sensitive  data, outsourcing  of  infrastructure, multi-tenancy  nature, and  critical applications.   
This  paper  proposing  a  framework  that  identifies  and  summarize  the  security  and  privacy  challenges  in  cloud 
services.  It    highlights    cloud-specific    attacks    and    risks    and    clearly  illustrates    their    mitigations    and  
countermeasures.  This is also highlight a multilevel security framework for cloud computing  that helps  to satisfy  
security  and  privacy  requirements  in  the  clouds  and protect  them  against intruder attacks.   The purpose of this 
work  is  to  demonstrate  and  introduced  a  security  and  privacy  aspect  that  will  take  into  considerations  while 
developing and using the cloud environment either by individuals or organizations.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing  is  one  of  the  rapidly  and  most  acceptable  growing  areas  of  information  technology.  It  is  a  new 
computing and processing scheme which available on Internet “Cloud’. Cloud computing  is  a  way to delivering the 
convenient on demand  network  access  to  a  shared  band  of  computing  resources such as networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services that can be rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal management effort or service 
provider interaction[2].   Cloud  computing  is  categorized  into  two  main parts:  Front  End  and  Back  End.  Front 
End is customer or client or any application (i.e. web browser etc.) which is uses the cloud services and Back End is the 
network  of  servers  with  a  computer  programs  and  data  storage  system  [1].paper  guidelines,  please  contact  the

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL 

In  cloud  computing  almost  every  things  being  delivers  as  a  Services  from  access  to  security.    The  cloud  is 

conflagration of buzzwords “as a Service” [3]. There are three types of services which are very special ongoing days. 
 
A.  Software as a Service 

Its means to deliver the various types of software’s on internet as a services. It is comes in reality around in early

use  the  various  applications  on  cloud  but  cloud  users  doesn’t  have  right  to  manage  them.    Ex.  Google,  salesforce, 
Microsoft and Zoho etc. 
 
B.  Platform as a Service 

Its gives  chance  and  flexibility  to  build,  develop,  test and  deploy  an application  on  service  provider’s machine  or 
platform whether it’s API, Storage or Infrastructure [3].  The freedom provided to the customer to create and acquire an 
application  created  using  either  different  programming languages  or  tools  supported  by  the provider  [10].  Customers 
get access to the platform by enabling them to organize their own software and application in the cloud [4].  It reduces 
the  cost  and  complexity  of  buying,  housing  and  managing  hardware  and  software  components  as  a  platform  to  the 
clients  [5].  Service  providers  are  only  responsible  for  integrity  and  availability  of  their  services  where  as  the  users 
responsible  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  [8].  Ex.  WAMP  (Windows,  Apache,  MySql,  and  PHP)  LAMP(Linux, 
Apache, MySql, and PHP) 
 
C.  Infrastructure as a Service 

SaaS  and  PaaS  are  providing  application  to  customers  where  as  IaaS  simply  offer  hardware  support  to  customer 
where they can put whatever they want onto it [8]. It offers access to various fundamental resources such as available in 
the  form  of  networks,  servers,  storage  devices,  computational  resources  and  many  more.  The  clients  doesn’t  have 
authority to manage these fundamental resources over the cloud, users can just used them [4]. Ex. Amazon, GoGrid and 
3tera. 

 

III. SECURITY ISSUES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING 

The security means to protect and get secure from unauthorized access, uses, disclosure, disruption, modification, 
perusal,  inspection,  recording  or  destruction  [1].  Cloud  computing  has  grown  rapidly  in  various  aspects  including 
services,  architecture,  computing  and  storage  due  the  utility  of  such  things  the  security  issues  can  be  viewed  as 
problems.  
 
A.  Account or Service Hijacking:

information as well. It will not give guaranty to stop all fraud but at least it restricts someone. Due to this cloud contain 
unethical and uncontrolled account which generate misbehave on cloud.

Above figure shows the essential security components such as 
 
A.  Authentication:  

To provide authenticated access to cloud is the major issue in the cloud environment. To manage this problem there 
is  need  individually  verification  and  validation.  Authentication  is  one  of  the  process  that  keep  data  away  from 
unauthorized  users and  it  typically  identity-based,  which  makes  authentication  of  the user’s  identity  [5].  When  cloud 
users logon to their accounts the Authentication system get activated and identify whether user if genuine user or not 
[2]. For authentication usernames and passwords are used to access the cloud.    
 
B.  Authorization:  

It is a process  where privileges are allocated to cloud users as per their login status and role they  want to play on 
cloud.  Sometime  User  authentication  and  chosen  service  on  cloud  will  decide  the  privileges  for  customers  and 
according to that user authorization gets a shape. As per the norms of authority the customer can do and manage the 
things on cloud. The Authorizations will decide what operation and task will execute by user. 
 
C.  Confidentiality of user:  

It  refers  only  right  user  get  command  and  access  over  the  things  in  cloud.  It  specifies  that  the  genuine  customer 

should get the access to the resources like computation, infrastructure, data storage and application handling.  
 
 
D.  Availability of resources at location:  

It  indicates  that  all  resources  whether  they  are  logical  or  fundamental  they  should  make  available  to  respective 
customer  wherever  and  whenever  they  needed.  Only  authenticated  and  authorized  user  should  get  access  of  the 
resources. 
 
E.  Integrity of Data:   

It is responsibility of cloud server to maintain the accurate computing of data that comes from integration of various 
files  and  deliver  it  within  specified  time.  While  performing  this  operation  the  cloud  should  make  sure  that  there  I 
provision  for  error  during  computing.  Also  there  should  be  some  mechanism  that  can  assure  the  customers  that 
whatever  data  will  be  stored  on  the  files  servers  will not hampering any  other  data  elements  [1].  Additionally  it  also 
specify to  protect  cloud  data  and  applications from  unauthorized  deletion,  modification,  theft, falsehood or abused 
[2].  Integrity  may  come  from  the  accuracy,  Isolation,  Atomicity,  completeness,  availability,  Consistency,  and 
Durability of a data.   
 
F.  Harmful Attacks:  

An  attack  can  happen  in  several  ways  on  cloud  and  every  attacker  come  to  spoil  the  things  on  cloud.  Someone 
randomly  create  a threat  on  cloud  and  someone  do  it  by  specific  intention.  These  attacker  either  come  to  collect  the 
valuable  data  present  on  cloud  or  to  disturb  the  behaviour  of  cloud  by  introducing  the  spoiling  agents  like  virus, 
malwares  etc.  These  attacks  may  follow  then  Unethical  Browsing  and  wrapping  of  data.  Wrapping  of  data  means 
attacker wrap the communication between two people in such a way that the individual feels that the data comes from 
original sources but actually it’s being designed by attacker not by original source.  Unethical Browsing means where 
bad actions being happens such as phishing, spoofing, alteration of browser certificates etc [2].  
 
G.  Concerning Risk Area:  

It  specifies  the  things  related  to  access  control,  Monitoring  of  data,  changing  of  data  format  (encryption  and 
decryption), data  isolation and  many  more.   It  exposes  the new  era  of  concerning risk.  Data  Isolation,  Data recovery 
and data location is one of them.  Data isolation means every individual will enjoy the separate copy data elements like 
maintain  by  any  database.  Data  Recovery  is  ability  to  restore  and  recover  the  data  if  a  disaster  occurred  [2].  Data 
location is nothing but the data should maintain and store in the same geographical regions where user belonged i.e if 
any user comes from India and its data should manage and store in the same territory so data will not be spread to some 
another one because norms and regulation may violet according to the territory.

privileges  and  authorization  as  per  the  prescribe  norms.  To  maintain  the  authentication  of  user  on  cloud  we  can 
implements  various  techniques  such  as  simple  user  name  and  password  protection  scheme,  Graphical  passwords 
protection  scheme  or  bio  information  based  user  authentication  as  per  the  requirements  of  data  and  cloud  services.

1)  Provide Secure Interface 
During verification and validation of user most of the Interfaces and API are stored the user personal information 
such as remember password, transaction history, scripts, cookies and additional plug inns without concerning or with 
concern to users. This information some time will access by cloud service provider to track the client and maintain the 
web traffic records. Sometime it will reach to intruder and entire securities of user as well as service provider get leaked 
to the outside world. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that they will 
need  only  important  information  of  users  to  provide  interaction  with  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, transaction history even user wishes to do it. 
 
B.  Privileged Control Unit:  

On  cloud there are millions and  billions  of  users  who  are  performing thousands  of  operation  of  same  or  different 
data element in a same or different area of computing. To manage the privacy and secrecy among these people is really 
a  tedious  job.    Here  privileged  based  separation  will  reduce  the  burden  of  mixing.    This  unit  is  essential  because  it 
protects  users’  privacy  and  security.  It  ensures  that  data integrity  and  confidentiality  by  applying  a  set  of  regulations 
and  policies  that  govern  the  authorization  process  of  cloud  users  [2].  Only  authorized  customers  get  access  to  data. 
Privileges set by cloud service provider as per the security norms fulfilled by services users. Privileges may verify time 
to time using public key encryption.

Abstract—  Cloud  computing  is  a  model  of  information  computing,  storage,  delivery  of  services  and  sharing 
infrastructure resources provided to clients on their demand.  Instead of purchasing actual physical devices servers, 
storage,  or  any  networking  equipment,  customer  used  these  resources  from  a  cloud  provider  as  an  outsourced 
service. It defined as ―a model of management of information, resources and applications as services over Internet 
as per requirement of clients‖.   Cloud  computing  is  a approach to convenient  and    on demand network access to  
a  shared group  of computing  resources  that  can  be provided by service  provider in the form of multiple services.   
It introduces a new Internet-based environment for on-demand access, dynamic provision for computing resources 
by using various type services on cloud. These models are referred as Software as a Service, Platform as a Service 
and Infrastructure as a Service.  Just because of that it is tough to manage the  security  and  privacy problems in 
cloud caused  by  its  sensitive  data, outsourcing  of  infrastructure, multi-tenancy  nature, and  critical applications.   
This  paper  proposing  a  framework  that  identifies  and  summarize  the  security  and  privacy  challenges  in  cloud 
services.  It    highlights    cloud-specific    attacks    and    risks    and    clearly  illustrates    their    mitigations    and  
countermeasures.  This is also highlight a multilevel security framework for cloud computing  that helps  to satisfy  
security  and  privacy  requirements  in  the  clouds  and protect  them  against intruder attacks.   The purpose of this 
work  is  to  demonstrate  and  introduced  a  security  and  privacy  aspect  that  will  take  into  considerations  while 
developing and using the cloud environment either by individuals or organizations.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing  is  one  of  the  rapidly  and  most  acceptable  growing  areas  of  information  technology.  It  is  a  new 
computing and processing scheme which available on Internet “Cloud’. Cloud computing  is  a  way to delivering the 
convenient on demand  network  access  to  a  shared  band  of  computing  resources such as networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services that can be rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal management effort or service 
provider interaction[2].   Cloud  computing  is  categorized  into  two  main parts:  Front  End  and  Back  End.  Front 
End is customer or client or any application (i.e. web browser etc.) which is uses the cloud services and Back End is the 
network  of  servers  with  a  computer  programs  and  data  storage  system  [1].paper  guidelines,  please  contact  the

available from the conference website. 
 

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL 

In  cloud  computing  almost  every  things  being  delivers  as  a  Services  from  access  to  security.    The  cloud  is 

conflagration of buzzwords “as a Service” [3]. There are three types of services which are very special ongoing days. 
 
A.  Software as a Service 

Its means to deliver the various types of software’s on internet as a services. It is comes in reality around in early 
2001 when it was referred as Application as a service [3]. In SaaS model, the user buys a subscription to some software 
product  and  services  but  these  data  and  code  available  on remote  server and  customer  can access  to  this  services  via 
Internet [8]. It provides the computation power in the form of software services on cloud multiple clients.  Clients can 
use  the  various  applications  on  cloud  but  cloud  users  doesn’t  have  right  to  manage  them.    Ex.  Google,  salesforce, 
Microsoft and Zoho etc. 
 
B.  Platform as a Service 

Its gives  chance  and  flexibility  to  build,  develop,  test and  deploy  an application  on  service  provider’s machine  or 
platform whether it’s API, Storage or Infrastructure [3].  The freedom provided to the customer to create and acquire an 
application  created  using  either  different  programming languages  or  tools  supported  by  the provider  [10].  Customers 
get access to the platform by enabling them to organize their own software and application in the cloud [4].  It reduces 
the  cost  and  complexity  of  buying,  housing  and  managing  hardware  and  software  components  as  a  platform  to  the 
clients  [5].  Service  providers  are  only  responsible  for  integrity  and  availability  of  their  services  where  as  the  users 
responsible  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  [8].  Ex.  WAMP  (Windows,  Apache,  MySql,  and  PHP)  LAMP(Linux, 
Apache, MySql, and PHP) 
 
C.  Infrastructure as a Service 

SaaS  and  PaaS  are  providing  application  to  customers  where  as  IaaS  simply  offer  hardware  support  to  customer 
where they can put whatever they want onto it [8]. It offers access to various fundamental resources such as available in 
the  form  of  networks,  servers,  storage  devices,  computational  resources  and  many  more.  The  clients  doesn’t  have 
authority to manage these fundamental resources over the cloud, users can just used them [4]. Ex. Amazon, GoGrid and 
3tera. 

 

III. SECURITY ISSUES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING 

The security means to protect and get secure from unauthorized access, uses, disclosure, disruption, modification, 
perusal,  inspection,  recording  or  destruction  [1].  Cloud  computing  has  grown  rapidly  in  various  aspects  including 
services,  architecture,  computing  and  storage  due  the  utility  of  such  things  the  security  issues  can  be  viewed  as 
problems.  
 
A.  Account or Service Hijacking: 

Hijacking refers to get complete control over others account and it is not new to the today’s  world but the attacks 
like  phishing,  fraud  and  exploitation  of  software  are  need  to  avoid  [1].  If  any  intruders  get  an  access  to  any  other 
account then security of account is lapsed completely and activities like deletion, updating data, and manipulation with 
account data create lots of burden to its account holder as well as the manger (cloud). The person who is carried out 
such things beings identified by the name of Intruder or Hacker. And it has been observed that mostly hacker will take 
an  advantages  of  silly  mistakes  performed  by  cloud  users  such  an  not  proper  log  off  of  service  windows,  allows 
additional plug ins even they are not be a part of cloud services, access illegal sites simultaneously with using on cloud 
services, share and distribute financial and personal information to other people etc. 
 
B.  Unknown Risk Profile:  

Information about who is sharing infrastructure may be relevant in addition to network instruction logs, redirection 
attempts and other logs, but low effort of security may be it can result in unknown exposures [3]. To track the unknown 
profile is tedious job. So its responsibility of cloud providers to verify every users before to allow them to be a part of 
cloud  and  for  that  cloud  providers  may  used  telephone  versification,  email  verification,  or  social  network  account 
verification  and  if  cloud  services  related  to  financial  sector  then  cloud  providers  may  refer  his  banking  or  financial

information as well. It will not give guaranty to stop all fraud but at least it restricts someone. Due to this cloud contain 
unethical and uncontrolled account which generate misbehave on cloud.  
 
C.   Shared Technology Issues: 

IaaS deliver the service of sharable infrastructure between multiple users.  The underlying components such as CPU 
and  Memory  were  not  designed  to  offer  strong  isolation  properties.  To  address  this  gap  a  virtualization  hyper  visor 
between  guest  operating  system  and  the  physical  compute  resources  [3].  Strong  compartmentalization  must  be 
implemented to avoid the access and control over the sharable infrastructure and the individual customers should not 
impact on other customers operation.  
 
D.  Architecture of Cloud Server: 

The actual location of the infrastructure such as computing servers, Data servers, Hardware’s is determined  by the 
cloud service provider. The implementation of reliability, scalability logic and virtual machines (VM) typically to serve 
as the abstract unit of deployment and are loosely coupled with the cloud storage architecture [5]. A VM or hypervisor 
is the additional layer between Operating system and Hardware and sometimes these supports to take control over the 
administrative  operations  like  migration,  launching  and  end  up  the  process  of  VM  objects.  If  any  individual  get 
command over the other’s VM object then it will create a major problem.  

 
E.   Identity Management: 

The proper identity of customer will help to manage the uniqueness of each user and to carry  out such things the 
different levels  of  user  authentication  and  validation  schemes  being  implemented  in  cloud  but  still  the  access  control 
will create a threat. Apart from authentication the identity management should have control over the user’s privileges 
and access to required resources [5]. Cloud should have capability to formulate and maintain user privileges about its 
access and task that user will performs on cloud as a part of identity management [5]. 
 
F.  Insecure Interface and API: 

The  cloud  providers  deliver  the  cloud  services  via  different  interfaces  and  API  where  customers have  freedom  to 
choose interface and interact with cloud services. It’s been observed that the security and availability of general cloud 
services is dependent on the security of interfaces and API [1]. Some time cloud users share their interface and API to 
access the cloud services and due to the week knowledge of security aspects, users will allow to such interfaces to store 
and  use  their  personal  information  in  the  form  of  remember  password,  transaction  history,  scripts,  cookies  and 
additional plug inns. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that interface 
need  only  meaningful  information  of  users  to  provide  access  to  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user’s  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, scripts, transaction history even user wishes to do it.

Above figure shows the essential security components such as 
 
A.  Authentication:  

To provide authenticated access to cloud is the major issue in the cloud environment. To manage this problem there 
is  need  individually  verification  and  validation.  Authentication  is  one  of  the  process  that  keep  data  away  from 
unauthorized  users and  it  typically  identity-based,  which  makes  authentication  of  the user’s  identity  [5].  When  cloud 
users logon to their accounts the Authentication system get activated and identify whether user if genuine user or not 
[2]. For authentication usernames and passwords are used to access the cloud.    
 
B.  Authorization:  

It is a process  where privileges are allocated to cloud users as per their login status and role they  want to play on 
cloud.  Sometime  User  authentication  and  chosen  service  on  cloud  will  decide  the  privileges  for  customers  and 
according to that user authorization gets a shape. As per the norms of authority the customer can do and manage the 
things on cloud. The Authorizations will decide what operation and task will execute by user. 
 
C.  Confidentiality of user:  

It  refers  only  right  user  get  command  and  access  over  the  things  in  cloud.  It  specifies  that  the  genuine  customer 

should get the access to the resources like computation, infrastructure, data storage and application handling.  
 
 
D.  Availability of resources at location:  

It  indicates  that  all  resources  whether  they  are  logical  or  fundamental  they  should  make  available  to  respective 
customer  wherever  and  whenever  they  needed.  Only  authenticated  and  authorized  user  should  get  access  of  the 
resources. 
 
E.  Integrity of Data:   

It is responsibility of cloud server to maintain the accurate computing of data that comes from integration of various 
files  and  deliver  it  within  specified  time.  While  performing  this  operation  the  cloud  should  make  sure  that  there  I 
provision  for  error  during  computing.  Also  there  should  be  some  mechanism  that  can  assure  the  customers  that 
whatever  data  will  be  stored  on  the  files  servers  will not hampering any  other  data  elements  [1].  Additionally  it  also 
specify to  protect  cloud  data  and  applications from  unauthorized  deletion,  modification,  theft, falsehood or abused 
[2].  Integrity  may  come  from  the  accuracy,  Isolation,  Atomicity,  completeness,  availability,  Consistency,  and 
Durability of a data.   
 
F.  Harmful Attacks:  

An  attack  can  happen  in  several  ways  on  cloud  and  every  attacker  come  to  spoil  the  things  on  cloud.  Someone 
randomly  create  a threat  on  cloud  and  someone  do  it  by  specific  intention.  These  attacker  either  come  to  collect  the 
valuable  data  present  on  cloud  or  to  disturb  the  behaviour  of  cloud  by  introducing  the  spoiling  agents  like  virus, 
malwares  etc.  These  attacks  may  follow  then  Unethical  Browsing  and  wrapping  of  data.  Wrapping  of  data  means 
attacker wrap the communication between two people in such a way that the individual feels that the data comes from 
original sources but actually it’s being designed by attacker not by original source.  Unethical Browsing means where 
bad actions being happens such as phishing, spoofing, alteration of browser certificates etc [2].  
 
G.  Concerning Risk Area:  

It  specifies  the  things  related  to  access  control,  Monitoring  of  data,  changing  of  data  format  (encryption  and 
decryption), data  isolation and  many  more.   It  exposes  the new  era  of  concerning risk.  Data  Isolation,  Data recovery 
and data location is one of them.  Data isolation means every individual will enjoy the separate copy data elements like 
maintain  by  any  database.  Data  Recovery  is  ability  to  restore  and  recover  the  data  if  a  disaster  occurred  [2].  Data 
location is nothing but the data should maintain and store in the same geographical regions where user belonged i.e if 
any user comes from India and its data should manage and store in the same territory so data will not be spread to some 
another one because norms and regulation may violet according to the territory.

V.  MULTILEVEL SECURITY FRAMEWORK  FOR CLOUD COMPUTING 

 

 

Fig 2: Cloud Computing Security Model 

 

The  above  figure  stated  as  the  multilevel  security  model  for  cloud  computing  by  introducing  the  security  and 

privacy instruments in cloud to protect the cloud against external crisis. 
 
A.  Verification and Validation Unit: 

The main task of any cloud security is to verify and authenticate the genuine user and to ensure that the correctness 
of  data  and  services  on  the  cloud  [2].    Here  the  user  authentication  mechanism  will  identify  the  user  and  allocates 
privileges  and  authorization  as  per  the  prescribe  norms.  To  maintain  the  authentication  of  user  on  cloud  we  can 
implements  various  techniques  such  as  simple  user  name  and  password  protection  scheme,  Graphical  passwords 
protection  scheme  or  bio  information  based  user  authentication  as  per  the  requirements  of  data  and  cloud  services. 
Digital signature is one the era of user authentication and authorization where documents being verified on the basis of 
digital signature to maintain the secrecy.  
 

1)  Provide Secure Interface 
During verification and validation of user most of the Interfaces and API are stored the user personal information 
such as remember password, transaction history, scripts, cookies and additional plug inns without concerning or with 
concern to users. This information some time will access by cloud service provider to track the client and maintain the 
web traffic records. Sometime it will reach to intruder and entire securities of user as well as service provider get leaked 
to the outside world. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that they will 
need  only  important  information  of  users  to  provide  interaction  with  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, transaction history even user wishes to do it. 
 
B.  Privileged Control Unit:  

On  cloud there are millions and  billions  of  users  who  are  performing thousands  of  operation  of  same  or  different 
data element in a same or different area of computing. To manage the privacy and secrecy among these people is really 
a  tedious  job.    Here  privileged  based  separation  will  reduce  the  burden  of  mixing.    This  unit  is  essential  because  it 
protects  users’  privacy  and  security.  It  ensures  that  data integrity  and  confidentiality  by  applying  a  set  of  regulations 
and  policies  that  govern  the  authorization  process  of  cloud  users  [2].  Only  authorized  customers  get  access  to  data. 
Privileges set by cloud service provider as per the security norms fulfilled by services users. Privileges may verify time 
to time using public key encryption.

Anup Date et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 528-534 

1)  Policy Approach: 
In this  framework  the  cloud  should make  a  decision about to  enforce  privacy  protection mechanism  publically  or 
privately to the access of data stored on cloud server either concerning to user or automatically [6]. Every user should 
specify  the  private  or  public  access  to  all  its  data.  Every  file,  documents,  or  data  unit  should  consist  of  these  policy 
norms, and if any user forgets to specify security policy then automatically security norms being allocated to its all data 
elements  on  cloud  server.  If  any  other  person  want  to  access  data  preset    on  cloud  but  it  belongs  to  other  user  then 
policy approach will take into consideration and as per the security approach if data is available publically then other 
user  will  get  access  to  it  otherwise  access  should  denied  to  that  documents  or  files.    Important  documents  such  as 
financial data or personal data may be protected by introducing the run time alert on user’s mobile phone.  
 
C.  Cryptography Unit: 

Data always stored in the encrypted format which encrypted get at the time of data uploading on the cloud either by 
single key  or double key (public key) encryption. The cloud will maintain the unique random key generator so every 
user  on  cloud  will  have  unique  key  for  data  encryption  and  decryption  purpose.    Standards  for  communication 
protocols and public key certificates allow data transfer to be protected using cryptography [5]. Only cryptography is 
not the single solution to privacy for cloud provider should invent used standards protocol for communication. Without 
a  properly  designed  auditing  protocol,  encryption  itself  cannot  prevent  data  from  flowing  towards  external  parties 
during  the  auditing  process  [3]. It  will help  to maintain  the  unique access  to  data.  Whenever  user  want to  access  the 
data then every time this user will get his decryption key via E-mail on his registered mail id registered at the time of 
creation of account on cloud. Techniques  for  data  protection  such  as truncation,  redaction,  obfuscation,  and  others  
can  be used  in  this security component [2].  
 
D.  Attack Detection Unit: 

This unit is responsible to stop the unwanted operation carried out by intruder on physical or logical resources of 
the  cloud. To  stop  the attacks  first  there  is need  to  detect and  identify  the  type  of  an  attack. This  unit is identify  the 
software  attack  by  introducing  the  software  based  solution  such  as  log  file  information,  history,  web  analytics,  IP 
address, Mobile No, decryption key, Service provider and other things being implemented in the software security form.  
 
 
 

VI. CONCLUSION 

Cloud computing brings the application software’s and databases to servers on the Internet, where the management 
of the data and services are not reliable. And as we moving forward to the direction of  cloud computing the security 
and privacy issues will generate day by day in the area of computation, storage management, infrastructure handling, 
input/output management, resource  utilization  and authorized  user  activities.  A  cloud  computing has  its  own  security 
threat  problems  and  such threats  are  completely  different  from  threats  in  physical  system  due  to  this to  attaining  the 
high assurance  qualities  in  development and implementation is  an  mysterious  goal  for  computer  security  researchers 
and  practitioners.  So  this  is  an  important  and  essential  factor  to  fulfil  the  security  and  privacy  requirement  while 
designing  and  implementing  the  cloud.  In  this  paper  it’s  explained  that  if  we  implement  the  multilevel  security 
framework on cloud then customer can enjoy the outcome without any  worry.  Here we tried to identify security and 
privacy  requirement,  threats,  concerns  issues,  risk  associated  to  cloud  and  multiple  security  frameworks  which 
somewhat complete cloud security requirement. Apart from this it is responsibility of cloud users and cloud provider 
organizations  should  enforce  some  security  and  privacy  policies  to  protect  cloud. There  is  wide  scope  for researcher 
and developers to introduce the new era knowledge in the area of security and privacy of cloud and it will bind strong 
and secure relation between cloud users and their vendors.

Abstract—  Cloud  computing  is  a  model  of  information  computing,  storage,  delivery  of  services  and  sharing 
infrastructure resources provided to clients on their demand.  Instead of purchasing actual physical devices servers, 
storage,  or  any  networking  equipment,  customer  used  these  resources  from  a  cloud  provider  as  an  outsourced 
service. It defined as ―a model of management of information, resources and applications as services over Internet 
as per requirement of clients‖.   Cloud  computing  is  a approach to convenient  and    on demand network access to  
a  shared group  of computing  resources  that  can  be provided by service  provider in the form of multiple services.   
It introduces a new Internet-based environment for on-demand access, dynamic provision for computing resources 
by using various type services on cloud. These models are referred as Software as a Service, Platform as a Service 
and Infrastructure as a Service.  Just because of that it is tough to manage the  security  and  privacy problems in 
cloud caused  by  its  sensitive  data, outsourcing  of  infrastructure, multi-tenancy  nature, and  critical applications.   
This  paper  proposing  a  framework  that  identifies  and  summarize  the  security  and  privacy  challenges  in  cloud 
services.  It    highlights    cloud-specific    attacks    and    risks    and    clearly  illustrates    their    mitigations    and  
countermeasures.  This is also highlight a multilevel security framework for cloud computing  that helps  to satisfy  
security  and  privacy  requirements  in  the  clouds  and protect  them  against intruder attacks.   The purpose of this 
work  is  to  demonstrate  and  introduced  a  security  and  privacy  aspect  that  will  take  into  considerations  while 
developing and using the cloud environment either by individuals or organizations.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing  is  one  of  the  rapidly  and  most  acceptable  growing  areas  of  information  technology.  It  is  a  new 
computing and processing scheme which available on Internet “Cloud’. Cloud computing  is  a  way to delivering the 
convenient on demand  network  access  to  a  shared  band  of  computing  resources such as networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services that can be rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal management effort or service 
provider interaction[2].   Cloud  computing  is  categorized  into  two  main parts:  Front  End  and  Back  End.  Front 
End is customer or client or any application (i.e. web browser etc.) which is uses the cloud services and Back End is the 
network  of  servers  with  a  computer  programs  and  data  storage  system  [1].paper  guidelines,  please  contact  the

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL 

In  cloud  computing  almost  every  things  being  delivers  as  a  Services  from  access  to  security.    The  cloud  is 

conflagration of buzzwords “as a Service” [3]. There are three types of services which are very special ongoing days. 
 
A.  Software as a Service 

Its means to deliver the various types of software’s on internet as a services. It is comes in reality around in early 
2001 when it was referred as Application as a service [3]. In SaaS model, the user buys a subscription to some software 
product  and  services  but  these  data  and  code  available  on remote  server and  customer  can access  to  this  services  via 
Internet [8]. It provides the computation power in the form of software services on cloud multiple clients.  Clients can 
use  the  various  applications  on  cloud  but  cloud  users  doesn’t  have  right  to  manage  them.    Ex.  Google,  salesforce, 
Microsoft and Zoho etc. 
 
B.  Platform as a Service 

Its gives  chance  and  flexibility  to  build,  develop,  test and  deploy  an application  on  service  provider’s machine  or 
platform whether it’s API, Storage or Infrastructure [3].  The freedom provided to the customer to create and acquire an 
application  created  using  either  different  programming languages  or  tools  supported  by  the provider  [10].  Customers 
get access to the platform by enabling them to organize their own software and application in the cloud [4].  It reduces 
the  cost  and  complexity  of  buying,  housing  and  managing  hardware  and  software  components  as  a  platform  to  the 
clients  [5].  Service  providers  are  only  responsible  for  integrity  and  availability  of  their  services  where  as  the  users 
responsible  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  [8].  Ex.  WAMP  (Windows,  Apache,  MySql,  and  PHP)  LAMP(Linux, 
Apache, MySql, and PHP) 
 
C.  Infrastructure as a Service 

SaaS  and  PaaS  are  providing  application  to  customers  where  as  IaaS  simply  offer  hardware  support  to  customer 
where they can put whatever they want onto it [8]. It offers access to various fundamental resources such as available in 
the  form  of  networks,  servers,  storage  devices,  computational  resources  and  many  more.  The  clients  doesn’t  have 
authority to manage these fundamental resources over the cloud, users can just used them [4]. Ex. Amazon, GoGrid and 
3tera. 

 

III. SECURITY ISSUES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING 

The security means to protect and get secure from unauthorized access, uses, disclosure, disruption, modification, 
perusal,  inspection,  recording  or  destruction  [1].  Cloud  computing  has  grown  rapidly  in  various  aspects  including 
services,  architecture,  computing  and  storage  due  the  utility  of  such  things  the  security  issues  can  be  viewed  as 
problems.  
 
A.  Account or Service Hijacking: 

Hijacking refers to get complete control over others account and it is not new to the today’s  world but the attacks 
like  phishing,  fraud  and  exploitation  of  software  are  need  to  avoid  [1].  If  any  intruders  get  an  access  to  any  other 
account then security of account is lapsed completely and activities like deletion, updating data, and manipulation with 
account data create lots of burden to its account holder as well as the manger (cloud). The person who is carried out 
such things beings identified by the name of Intruder or Hacker. And it has been observed that mostly hacker will take 
an  advantages  of  silly  mistakes  performed  by  cloud  users  such  an  not  proper  log  off  of  service  windows,  allows 
additional plug ins even they are not be a part of cloud services, access illegal sites simultaneously with using on cloud 
services, share and distribute financial and personal information to other people etc. 
 
B.  Unknown Risk Profile:  

Information about who is sharing infrastructure may be relevant in addition to network instruction logs, redirection 
attempts and other logs, but low effort of security may be it can result in unknown exposures [3]. To track the unknown 
profile is tedious job. So its responsibility of cloud providers to verify every users before to allow them to be a part of 
cloud  and  for  that  cloud  providers  may  used  telephone  versification,  email  verification,  or  social  network  account 
verification  and  if  cloud  services  related  to  financial  sector  then  cloud  providers  may  refer  his  banking  or  financial

information as well. It will not give guaranty to stop all fraud but at least it restricts someone. Due to this cloud contain 
unethical and uncontrolled account which generate misbehave on cloud.  
 
C.   Shared Technology Issues: 

IaaS deliver the service of sharable infrastructure between multiple users.  The underlying components such as CPU 
and  Memory  were  not  designed  to  offer  strong  isolation  properties.  To  address  this  gap  a  virtualization  hyper  visor 
between  guest  operating  system  and  the  physical  compute  resources  [3].  Strong  compartmentalization  must  be 
implemented to avoid the access and control over the sharable infrastructure and the individual customers should not 
impact on other customers operation.  
 
D.  Architecture of Cloud Server: 

The actual location of the infrastructure such as computing servers, Data servers, Hardware’s is determined  by the 
cloud service provider. The implementation of reliability, scalability logic and virtual machines (VM) typically to serve 
as the abstract unit of deployment and are loosely coupled with the cloud storage architecture [5]. A VM or hypervisor 
is the additional layer between Operating system and Hardware and sometimes these supports to take control over the 
administrative  operations  like  migration,  launching  and  end  up  the  process  of  VM  objects.  If  any  individual  get 
command over the other’s VM object then it will create a major problem.  

 
E.   Identity Management: 

The proper identity of customer will help to manage the uniqueness of each user and to carry  out such things the 
different levels  of  user  authentication  and  validation  schemes  being  implemented  in  cloud  but  still  the  access  control 
will create a threat. Apart from authentication the identity management should have control over the user’s privileges 
and access to required resources [5]. Cloud should have capability to formulate and maintain user privileges about its 
access and task that user will performs on cloud as a part of identity management [5]. 
 
F.  Insecure Interface and API: 

The  cloud  providers  deliver  the  cloud  services  via  different  interfaces  and  API  where  customers have  freedom  to 
choose interface and interact with cloud services. It’s been observed that the security and availability of general cloud 
services is dependent on the security of interfaces and API [1]. Some time cloud users share their interface and API to 
access the cloud services and due to the week knowledge of security aspects, users will allow to such interfaces to store 
and  use  their  personal  information  in  the  form  of  remember  password,  transaction  history,  scripts,  cookies  and 
additional plug inns. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that interface 
need  only  meaningful  information  of  users  to  provide  access  to  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user’s  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, scripts, transaction history even user wishes to do it.

Above figure shows the essential security components such as 
 
A.  Authentication:  

To provide authenticated access to cloud is the major issue in the cloud environment. To manage this problem there 
is  need  individually  verification  and  validation.  Authentication  is  one  of  the  process  that  keep  data  away  from 
unauthorized  users and  it  typically  identity-based,  which  makes  authentication  of  the user’s  identity  [5].  When  cloud 
users logon to their accounts the Authentication system get activated and identify whether user if genuine user or not 
[2]. For authentication usernames and passwords are used to access the cloud.    
 
B.  Authorization:  

It is a process  where privileges are allocated to cloud users as per their login status and role they  want to play on 
cloud.  Sometime  User  authentication  and  chosen  service  on  cloud  will  decide  the  privileges  for  customers  and 
according to that user authorization gets a shape. As per the norms of authority the customer can do and manage the 
things on cloud. The Authorizations will decide what operation and task will execute by user. 
 
C.  Confidentiality of user:  

It  refers  only  right  user  get  command  and  access  over  the  things  in  cloud.  It  specifies  that  the  genuine  customer 

should get the access to the resources like computation, infrastructure, data storage and application handling.  
 
 
D.  Availability of resources at location:  

It  indicates  that  all  resources  whether  they  are  logical  or  fundamental  they  should  make  available  to  respective 
customer  wherever  and  whenever  they  needed.  Only  authenticated  and  authorized  user  should  get  access  of  the 
resources. 
 
E.  Integrity of Data:   

It is responsibility of cloud server to maintain the accurate computing of data that comes from integration of various 
files  and  deliver  it  within  specified  time.  While  performing  this  operation  the  cloud  should  make  sure  that  there  I 
provision  for  error  during  computing.  Also  there  should  be  some  mechanism  that  can  assure  the  customers  that 
whatever  data  will  be  stored  on  the  files  servers  will not hampering any  other  data  elements  [1].  Additionally  it  also 
specify to  protect  cloud  data  and  applications from  unauthorized  deletion,  modification,  theft, falsehood or abused 
[2].  Integrity  may  come  from  the  accuracy,  Isolation,  Atomicity,  completeness,  availability,  Consistency,  and 
Durability of a data.   
 
F.  Harmful Attacks:  

An  attack  can  happen  in  several  ways  on  cloud  and  every  attacker  come  to  spoil  the  things  on  cloud.  Someone 
randomly  create  a threat  on  cloud  and  someone  do  it  by  specific  intention.  These  attacker  either  come  to  collect  the 
valuable  data  present  on  cloud  or  to  disturb  the  behaviour  of  cloud  by  introducing  the  spoiling  agents  like  virus, 
malwares  etc.  These  attacks  may  follow  then  Unethical  Browsing  and  wrapping  of  data.  Wrapping  of  data  means 
attacker wrap the communication between two people in such a way that the individual feels that the data comes from 
original sources but actually it’s being designed by attacker not by original source.  Unethical Browsing means where 
bad actions being happens such as phishing, spoofing, alteration of browser certificates etc [2].  
 
G.  Concerning Risk Area:  

It  specifies  the  things  related  to  access  control,  Monitoring  of  data,  changing  of  data  format  (encryption  and 
decryption), data  isolation and  many  more.   It  exposes  the new  era  of  concerning risk.  Data  Isolation,  Data recovery 
and data location is one of them.  Data isolation means every individual will enjoy the separate copy data elements like 
maintain  by  any  database.  Data  Recovery  is  ability  to  restore  and  recover  the  data  if  a  disaster  occurred  [2].  Data 
location is nothing but the data should maintain and store in the same geographical regions where user belonged i.e if 
any user comes from India and its data should manage and store in the same territory so data will not be spread to some 
another one because norms and regulation may violet according to the territory.

V.  MULTILEVEL SECURITY FRAMEWORK  FOR CLOUD COMPUTING 

 

 

Fig 2: Cloud Computing Security Model 

 

The  above  figure  stated  as  the  multilevel  security  model  for  cloud  computing  by  introducing  the  security  and 

privacy instruments in cloud to protect the cloud against external crisis. 
 
A.  Verification and Validation Unit: 

The main task of any cloud security is to verify and authenticate the genuine user and to ensure that the correctness 
of  data  and  services  on  the  cloud  [2].    Here  the  user  authentication  mechanism  will  identify  the  user  and  allocates 
privileges  and  authorization  as  per  the  prescribe  norms.  To  maintain  the  authentication  of  user  on  cloud  we  can 
implements  various  techniques  such  as  simple  user  name  and  password  protection  scheme,  Graphical  passwords 
protection  scheme  or  bio  information  based  user  authentication  as  per  the  requirements  of  data  and  cloud  services. 
Digital signature is one the era of user authentication and authorization where documents being verified on the basis of 
digital signature to maintain the secrecy.  
 

1)  Provide Secure Interface 
During verification and validation of user most of the Interfaces and API are stored the user personal information 
such as remember password, transaction history, scripts, cookies and additional plug inns without concerning or with 
concern to users. This information some time will access by cloud service provider to track the client and maintain the 
web traffic records. Sometime it will reach to intruder and entire securities of user as well as service provider get leaked 
to the outside world. So its responsibility to cloud provider to invent an API and interface in such a way that they will 
need  only  important  information  of  users  to  provide  interaction  with  cloud  services  and  do  not  store  user  personal 
information such as passwords, cookies, transaction history even user wishes to do it. 
 
B.  Privileged Control Unit:  

On  cloud there are millions and  billions  of  users  who  are  performing thousands  of  operation  of  same  or  different 
data element in a same or different area of computing. To manage the privacy and secrecy among these people is really 
a  tedious  job.    Here  privileged  based  separation  will  reduce  the  burden  of  mixing.    This  unit  is  essential  because  it 
protects  users’  privacy  and  security.  It  ensures  that  data integrity  and  confidentiality  by  applying  a  set  of  regulations 
and  policies  that  govern  the  authorization  process  of  cloud  users  [2].  Only  authorized  customers  get  access  to  data. 
Privileges set by cloud service provider as per the security norms fulfilled by services users. Privileges may verify time 
to time using public key encryption.

Anup Date et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 528-534 

1)  Policy Approach: 
In this  framework  the  cloud  should make  a  decision about to  enforce  privacy  protection mechanism  publically  or 
privately to the access of data stored on cloud server either concerning to user or automatically [6]. Every user should 
specify  the  private  or  public  access  to  all  its  data.  Every  file,  documents,  or  data  unit  should  consist  of  these  policy 
norms, and if any user forgets to specify security policy then automatically security norms being allocated to its all data 
elements  on  cloud  server.  If  any  other  person  want  to  access  data  preset    on  cloud  but  it  belongs  to  other  user  then 
policy approach will take into consideration and as per the security approach if data is available publically then other 
user  will  get  access  to  it  otherwise  access  should  denied  to  that  documents  or  files.    Important  documents  such  as 
financial data or personal data may be protected by introducing the run time alert on user’s mobile phone.  
 
C.  Cryptography Unit: 

Data always stored in the encrypted format which encrypted get at the time of data uploading on the cloud either by 
single key  or double key (public key) encryption. The cloud will maintain the unique random key generator so every 
user  on  cloud  will  have  unique  key  for  data  encryption  and  decryption  purpose.    Standards  for  communication 
protocols and public key certificates allow data transfer to be protected using cryptography [5]. Only cryptography is 
not the single solution to privacy for cloud provider should invent used standards protocol for communication. Without 
a  properly  designed  auditing  protocol,  encryption  itself  cannot  prevent  data  from  flowing  towards  external  parties 
during  the  auditing  process  [3]. It  will help  to maintain  the  unique access  to  data.  Whenever  user  want to  access  the 
data then every time this user will get his decryption key via E-mail on his registered mail id registered at the time of 
creation of account on cloud. Techniques  for  data  protection  such  as truncation,  redaction,  obfuscation,  and  others  
can  be used  in  this security component [2].  
 
D.  Attack Detection Unit: 

This unit is responsible to stop the unwanted operation carried out by intruder on physical or logical resources of 
the  cloud. To  stop  the attacks  first  there  is need  to  detect and  identify  the  type  of  an  attack. This  unit is identify  the 
software  attack  by  introducing  the  software  based  solution  such  as  log  file  information,  history,  web  analytics,  IP 
address, Mobile No, decryption key, Service provider and other things being implemented in the software security form.  
 
 
 

VI. CONCLUSION 

Cloud computing brings the application software’s and databases to servers on the Internet, where the management 
of the data and services are not reliable. And as we moving forward to the direction of  cloud computing the security 
and privacy issues will generate day by day in the area of computation, storage management, infrastructure handling, 
input/output management, resource  utilization  and authorized  user  activities.  A  cloud  computing has  its  own  security 
threat  problems  and  such threats  are  completely  different  from  threats  in  physical  system  due  to  this to  attaining  the 
high assurance  qualities  in  development and implementation is  an  mysterious  goal  for  computer  security  researchers 
and  practitioners.  So  this  is  an  important  and  essential  factor  to  fulfil  the  security  and  privacy  requirement  while 
designing  and  implementing  the  cloud.  In  this  paper  it’s  explained  that  if  we  implement  the  multilevel  security 
framework on cloud then customer can enjoy the outcome without any  worry.  Here we tried to identify security and 
privacy  requirement,  threats,  concerns  issues,  risk  associated  to  cloud  and  multiple  security  frameworks  which 
somewhat complete cloud security requirement. Apart from this it is responsibility of cloud users and cloud provider 
organizations  should  enforce  some  security  and  privacy  policies  to  protect  cloud. There  is  wide  scope  for researcher 
and developers to introduce the new era knowledge in the area of security and privacy of cloud and it will bind strong 
and secure relation between cloud users and their vendors.
