1.1Service models of cloud 

Following are the service models of cloud computing. To share services within 

any one of the following service models are: 

  Software as a service (SaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is 

to  use  the  provider’s  application  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 

applications  are  accessible  from  variant  client  devices  through  a  thin 

client interface such as a web browser. The consumer does not manage or 

control the underlying cloud infrastructure [2]. 

Advantages: Rapid start-up, maintenance and upgrades performed by the 

vendor, scalable. Risks: Minimal customization, data integration, security 

and privacy, no control over upgrades, exit strategy, proliferation. 

Examples: Salesforce.com, Google Apps. 

  Platform as a service (PaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is 

to  deploy  on  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  consumer-created  or  acquired 

applications created using programming languages and tools supported by 

the  provider.  Various  types  of  PaaS  vendors  offerings  can  be  extensive 

and  can  include  complete  application  hosting,  development,  testing  and 

deployment  environment  as  well  as  extensive  integrated  services  that 

include scalability, maintenance and versioning. 

Advantages:  Focus  on  high  value  rather  than  infrastructure,  leverage 

economies of scale, provides scalable go-to-market capability. 

Risks: Exit strategy, pricing model, upgrade issues. 

Examples: force.com, Microsoft Azure, web and e-mail hosting. 

  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability  provided  to  the 

consumer  is  to  provision  processing,  storage,  networks  and  other 

fundamental  computing  resources  where  the  consumer  is  able  to  deploy 

and  run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating  system  and 

application. 

Advantages: Scalable, rapid start-up, peak levelling

1.2 Deployment Models of Cloud 
         1) 1. Public Cloud 

Public  cloud  or  external  cloud  describes  cloud  computing  in  the 

traditional  main  stream  sense,  whereby  resources  are  dynamically  provisioned 

on a fine-grained, self-service basis over the Internet, via web applications/web 

services, from  an  off-site third-party  provider  who  bills  on  a utility  computing 

basis [3]. 

 
         2) Private Cloud 

Some  vendors  have  used  the  terms  to  describe  offerings  that  emulate  cloud 

computing  on  private  networks.  These  (typically  virtualization  automation) 

products offer the ability to host applications or virtual machines in company’s 

own  set  of  hosts.  These  provide  the  benefits  of  utility  computing  –shared 

hardware costs, the ability to recover from failure, and the ability to scale up or 

down depending upon demand. 

         3) Community cloud 

Community  cloud  may  be  established  where  several  organizations  have 

similar requirements and seek to share infrastructure so as to realize some of the 

benefits  of  cloud  computing.  With  the  costs  spread  over  fewer  users  than  a 

public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  single  tenant)  this  option is  more  expensive but 

may  offer  a  higher  level  of  privacy,  security  and/or  policy  compliance. 

Examples of community cloud include Google’s “Gov Cloud”. 

          4) Hybrid cloud 

The  term  “Hybrid  Cloud”  has  been  used  to  mean  either  two  separate 

clouds joined together (public, private, internal or external), or a combination of 

virtualized  cloud  server  instances  used  together  with  real  physical  hardware. 

The  most correct definition of the term  “Hybrid Cloud” is probably the use of

physical  hardware  and  virtualized  cloud  server  instances  together  to  provide  a 

single common service [4]. By integrating multiple cloud services users may be 

able  to  ease  the  transition  to  public  cloud  services  Another  perspective  on 

deploying a web application in the cloud is using Hybrid Web Hosting, where 

the  hosting  infrastructure  is  a  mix  between  Cloud  Hosting  and  Managed 

dedicated servers – this is most commonly achieved as part of a web cluster in 

which  some  of  the  nodes  are  running  on  real  physical  hardware  and  some  are 

running on cloud server instances. A hybrid storage cloud uses a combination of 

public  and  private  storage  clouds.  Hybrid  storage  clouds  are  often  useful  for 

archiving and backup functions, allowing local data to be replicated to a public 

cloud.

1.2 Deployment Models of Cloud 
         1) 1. Public Cloud 

Public  cloud  or  external  cloud  describes  cloud  computing  in  the 

traditional  main  stream  sense,  whereby  resources  are  dynamically  provisioned 

on a fine-grained, self-service basis over the Internet, via web applications/web 

services, from  an  off-site third-party  provider  who  bills  on  a utility  computing 

basis [3]. 

 
         2) Private Cloud 

Some  vendors  have  used  the  terms  to  describe  offerings  that  emulate  cloud 

computing  on  private  networks.  These  (typically  virtualization  automation) 

products offer the ability to host applications or virtual machines in company’s 

own  set  of  hosts.  These  provide  the  benefits  of  utility  computing  –shared 

hardware costs, the ability to recover from failure, and the ability to scale up or 

down depending upon demand. 

         3) Community cloud 

Community  cloud  may  be  established  where  several  organizations  have 

similar requirements and seek to share infrastructure so as to realize some of the 

benefits  of  cloud  computing.  With  the  costs  spread  over  fewer  users  than  a 

public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  single  tenant)  this  option is  more  expensive but 

may  offer  a  higher  level  of  privacy,  security  and/or  policy  compliance. 

Examples of community cloud include Google’s “Gov Cloud”. 

          4) Hybrid cloud 

The  term  “Hybrid  Cloud”  has  been  used  to  mean  either  two  separate 

clouds joined together (public, private, internal or external), or a combination of 

virtualized  cloud  server  instances  used  together  with  real  physical  hardware. 

The  most correct definition of the term  “Hybrid Cloud” is probably the use of

physical  hardware  and  virtualized  cloud  server  instances  together  to  provide  a 

single common service [4]. By integrating multiple cloud services users may be 

able  to  ease  the  transition  to  public  cloud  services  Another  perspective  on 

deploying a web application in the cloud is using Hybrid Web Hosting, where 

the  hosting  infrastructure  is  a  mix  between  Cloud  Hosting  and  Managed 

dedicated servers – this is most commonly achieved as part of a web cluster in 

which  some  of  the  nodes  are  running  on  real  physical  hardware  and  some  are 

running on cloud server instances. A hybrid storage cloud uses a combination of 

public  and  private  storage  clouds.  Hybrid  storage  clouds  are  often  useful  for 

archiving and backup functions, allowing local data to be replicated to a public 

cloud.

2.  Architecture of cloud Computing 

 
Cloud  computing  architecture refers  to  the  components  and  subcomponents 
required for cloud computing [7]. These components typically consist of a front 
end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile device), back end platforms (servers,

storage), a  cloud  based  delivery,  and  a  network  (Internet,  Intranet, Intercloud). 
Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture. 
    
 2.1) Front End Platform 

These  clients  comprise  servers,  fat  (or  thick)  clients,  thin  clients,  zero 
clients, tablets  and  mobile  devices.  These  client  platforms  interact  with  the 
cloud  data  storage  via  an  application  (middleware),  via  a  web  browser,  or 
through a virtual session. 

The  zero  or  ultra-thin  client  initializes  the  network  to  gather  required 
configuration  files  that  then  tell  it  where  its  OS binaries  are  stored.  The  entire 
zero client devices runs via the network. This creates a single point of failure, in 
that, if the network goes down, the device is rendered useless. 
 

2.2) Back End Platform 

It contain cloud server, cloud storage and cloud based delivery and network..

1.  Introduction 

Cloud  Computing  is  the  computing  with  cloud.  Cloud  is  the  Internet.  In  the 

cloud  we  can  do  many  applications at the  time  on  the  connected computers in 

the network. 

Although cloud computing has been widely adopted by the industry, still there 

are many faults in cloud computing [1]. Cloud provides the some basic service 

with the help of service models.

1.1Service models of cloud 

Following are the service models of cloud computing. To share services within 

any one of the following service models are: 

  Software as a service (SaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is 

to  use  the  provider’s  application  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 

applications  are  accessible  from  variant  client  devices  through  a  thin 

client interface such as a web browser. The consumer does not manage or 

control the underlying cloud infrastructure [2]. 

Advantages: Rapid start-up, maintenance and upgrades performed by the 

vendor, scalable. Risks: Minimal customization, data integration, security 

and privacy, no control over upgrades, exit strategy, proliferation. 

Examples: Salesforce.com, Google Apps. 

  Platform as a service (PaaS): The capability provided to the consumer is 

to  deploy  on  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  consumer-created  or  acquired 

applications created using programming languages and tools supported by 

the  provider.  Various  types  of  PaaS  vendors  offerings  can  be  extensive 

and  can  include  complete  application  hosting,  development,  testing  and 

deployment  environment  as  well  as  extensive  integrated  services  that 

include scalability, maintenance and versioning. 

Advantages:  Focus  on  high  value  rather  than  infrastructure,  leverage 

economies of scale, provides scalable go-to-market capability. 

Risks: Exit strategy, pricing model, upgrade issues. 

Examples: force.com, Microsoft Azure, web and e-mail hosting. 

  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability  provided  to  the 

consumer  is  to  provision  processing,  storage,  networks  and  other 

fundamental  computing  resources  where  the  consumer  is  able  to  deploy 

and  run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating  system  and 

application. 

Advantages: Scalable, rapid start-up, peak levelling

are  more  chances  of  errors.  In  order  to  minimize  failure  impact  on  the  system 

and  application  execution,  failures  should  be  anticipated  and  proactively 

handled. Fault tolerance techniques are used to predict these failures and take an 

appropriate action before failures actually occur. There are various faults which 

can occur in cloud computing [1] . 

1)  Memory Threshold  

This is the fault in which some memory and threshold value is given by 

the  cloud  server  to  the  client.  If  the  client  is  accessing  the  files  beyond 

this limit then it consider as a fault.

          In  this  fault  unauthorized  attacker  tries  to  accessing  the  files  from  the 

cloud by modifying the existing files.

computing  on  private  networks.  These  (typically  virtualization  automation) 

products offer the ability to host applications or virtual machines in company’s 

own  set  of  hosts.  These  provide  the  benefits  of  utility  computing  –shared 

hardware costs, the ability to recover from failure, and the ability to scale up or 

down depending upon demand. 

         3) Community cloud 

Community  cloud  may  be  established  where  several  organizations  have 

similar requirements and seek to share infrastructure so as to realize some of the 

benefits  of  cloud  computing.  With  the  costs  spread  over  fewer  users  than  a 

public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  single  tenant)  this  option is  more  expensive but 

may  offer  a  higher  level  of  privacy,  security  and/or  policy  compliance. 

Examples of community cloud include Google’s “Gov Cloud”. 

          4) Hybrid cloud 

The  term  “Hybrid  Cloud”  has  been  used  to  mean  either  two  separate 

clouds joined together (public, private, internal or external), or a combination of 

virtualized  cloud  server  instances  used  together  with  real  physical  hardware. 

The  most correct definition of the term  “Hybrid Cloud” is probably the use of

physical  hardware  and  virtualized  cloud  server  instances  together  to  provide  a 

single common service [4]. By integrating multiple cloud services users may be 

able  to  ease  the  transition  to  public  cloud  services  Another  perspective  on 

deploying a web application in the cloud is using Hybrid Web Hosting, where 

the  hosting  infrastructure  is  a  mix  between  Cloud  Hosting  and  Managed 

dedicated servers – this is most commonly achieved as part of a web cluster in 

which  some  of  the  nodes  are  running  on  real  physical  hardware  and  some  are 

running on cloud server instances. A hybrid storage cloud uses a combination of 

public  and  private  storage  clouds.  Hybrid  storage  clouds  are  often  useful  for 

archiving and backup functions, allowing local data to be replicated to a public 

cloud.

2.  Architecture of cloud Computing 

 
Cloud  computing  architecture refers  to  the  components  and  subcomponents 
required for cloud computing [7]. These components typically consist of a front 
end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile device), back end platforms (servers,

storage), a  cloud  based  delivery,  and  a  network  (Internet,  Intranet, Intercloud). 
Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture. 
    
 2.1) Front End Platform 

These  clients  comprise  servers,  fat  (or  thick)  clients,  thin  clients,  zero 
clients, tablets  and  mobile  devices.  These  client  platforms  interact  with  the 
cloud  data  storage  via  an  application  (middleware),  via  a  web  browser,  or 
through a virtual session. 

The  zero  or  ultra-thin  client  initializes  the  network  to  gather  required 
configuration  files  that  then  tell  it  where  its  OS binaries  are  stored.  The  entire 
zero client devices runs via the network. This creates a single point of failure, in 
that, if the network goes down, the device is rendered useless. 
 

2.2) Back End Platform 

It contain cloud server, cloud storage and cloud based delivery and network..

4.  Faults in Cloud Computing 

are  more  chances  of  errors.  In  order  to  minimize  failure  impact  on  the  system 

and  application  execution,  failures  should  be  anticipated  and  proactively 

handled. Fault tolerance techniques are used to predict these failures and take an 

appropriate action before failures actually occur. There are various faults which 

can occur in cloud computing [1] . 

1)  Memory Threshold  

This is the fault in which some memory and threshold value is given by 

the  cloud  server  to  the  client.  If  the  client  is  accessing  the  files  beyond 

this limit then it consider as a fault. 

2)  Credential fault 

          In  this  fault  unauthorized  attacker  tries  to  accessing  the  files  from  the 

cloud by modifying the existing files. 

                Based  on  fault  tolerance  policies  various  fault  tolerance  techniques 

can be used that can either be task level or workflow level
