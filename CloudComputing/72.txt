1    Introduction 

ERP  provides  an  integrated  real-time  view  of  core  business  processes,  using  common 
databases maintained by a database management system. The applications that make up 
the system share data across the various departments that entered the data. ERP facilitates 
information  flow  between  all  business  functions,  and  manages  connections  to  outside 
stakeholders [1][2]. 

Mobile  device  use  for  ERP  functions  is  an  inevitable  extension  of  our  increasingly 
connected  wireless  society,  and  offers  a  wealth  of  advantages  as  employees  meet 
customers on their own turf. [3]. 

Cloud based ERP benefits customers by providing application scalability and reduced 
hardware  costs.  In  addition,  Cloud  computing  technology  made  it  easier  to  deliver  our 
ERP software as a service (SaaS) for customers who want to acquire cloud ERP and not 
have  to  manage  hardware,  software,  and  upgrades  while  reducing  up-front  expenses.

According  to  data  from  the  2012  ERP  Benchmark  Survey  as  of  October  2012,  the 
majority  of  ERP  solution  is  currently,  deployed  on-premise.  This  is  unsurprising  since 
SaaS and hosted solutions are only now coming to the forefront. Today, the gap between 
the SaaS and on-premise solutions is more pronounced in larger organization. On-premise

outside of the organization. In the survey performed, 62% indicated that the sales can be 
improved through the cloud technology. This could be because sales professionals can be 
constantly connected to customer data in order to improve efficiency and customer service, 
or sales professionals can check inventory in real-time in order to guarantee delivery times

3    Mobile Cloud-based ERP System 

The advances in mobile industry also brought an idea to put the ERP system into to next 
level. The business owners are still hesitant to migrate from standard hardware support to 
mobile  system.  Mobile  cloud  applications  move  the  computing  power  and  data  storage 
away  from  the  mobile  devices  and  into  powerful  and  centralized  computing  platforms 
located in clouds, which are then accessed over the wireless connection based on a thin 
native client. 

•  Mobile devices are connected to the mobile networks via base stations that establish 
and  control  the  connections  and  functional  interfaces  between  the  networks  and 
mobile devices. 

•  Mobile users’ requests and information are transmitted to the central processors that 

are connected to servers providing mobile network services. 

•  The subscribers’ requests are delivered to a cloud through the Internet.   

3.1 Mobility Platform 

Enterprise  mobility  management (EMM) is the set of people, processes and technology 
focused  on  managing  the  increasing  array  of  mobile  devices,  wireless  networks,  and 
related services to enable broad use of mobile computing in a business context. When we 
say  mobility  management  it  is  refer  to  the  management  for  mobility  of  the  device.  To 
perform  a  daily  transaction,  employees  maybe  move  from  one  place  to  another,  hence 
mobility is very important. This is an emerging discipline within the enterprise that has 
become  increasingly  important  over  the  past  few  years  as  more  workers  have  bought 
smartphone and tablet computing devices and have sought support for using these devices 
in the workplace [3][4].

interfaces, can be used to identify specific points where the application can be extended to 
add specialized behavior expressed using source code.

The figure 5depicts the core design of an AOM. This design can change the relationship, 
attribute  and  behavior  of  the  existing  system  by  integrating  it  with  the  analysis  of  the 
business requirements, like for example the accountability entity and accountabilityType, 
by analyzing the business rule, we can restructure the existing entity and adapt the new 
entity the new attributes and constraints.

1    Introduction 

ERP  provides  an  integrated  real-time  view  of  core  business  processes,  using  common 
databases maintained by a database management system. The applications that make up 
the system share data across the various departments that entered the data. ERP facilitates 
information  flow  between  all  business  functions,  and  manages  connections  to  outside 
stakeholders [1][2]. 

Mobile  device  use  for  ERP  functions  is  an  inevitable  extension  of  our  increasingly 
connected  wireless  society,  and  offers  a  wealth  of  advantages  as  employees  meet 
customers on their own turf. [3]. 

Cloud based ERP benefits customers by providing application scalability and reduced 
hardware  costs.  In  addition,  Cloud  computing  technology  made  it  easier  to  deliver  our 
ERP software as a service (SaaS) for customers who want to acquire cloud ERP and not 
have  to  manage  hardware,  software,  and  upgrades  while  reducing  up-front  expenses. 
Cloud  based  ERP  benefits  customers  by  providing  application  scalability  and  reduced 
hardware  costs.  It  is  low  cost,  supports  rapid  development,  flexible  and  scalable.  It 
improved  accessibility,  mobility  and  usability;  also  it  improved  system  availability  and

the company’s readiness and capability to handle such transition. 

2    Background of the Study 

2.1Cloud based ERP vs. On-premise ERP Surveys 

 

According  to  data  from  the  2012  ERP  Benchmark  Survey  as  of  October  2012,  the 
majority  of  ERP  solution  is  currently,  deployed  on-premise.  This  is  unsurprising  since 
SaaS and hosted solutions are only now coming to the forefront. Today, the gap between 
the SaaS and on-premise solutions is more pronounced in larger organization. On-premise 
got 79% over 4% of SaaS[5].

The functions are often performed outside of the office walls or deal with moving parts 
outside of the organization. In the survey performed, 62% indicated that the sales can be 
improved through the cloud technology. This could be because sales professionals can be 
constantly connected to customer data in order to improve efficiency and customer service, 
or sales professionals can check inventory in real-time in order to guarantee delivery times 
[6].

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.51 (ACIT 2014)318Copyright © 2014 SERSCImproved data backup services/ disaster recovery was the top factor driving interest in the 
cloud.  However,  among  organizations  with  cloud-based  services  in  place  or  working 
toward implementing one, cost savings was the top influencer (51%). Ref. -2013 Outlook 
on Technology Cloud Computing Survey Results, 2013 PC Connection [7]. 

3    Mobile Cloud-based ERP System 

The advances in mobile industry also brought an idea to put the ERP system into to next 
level. The business owners are still hesitant to migrate from standard hardware support to 
mobile  system.  Mobile  cloud  applications  move  the  computing  power  and  data  storage 
away  from  the  mobile  devices  and  into  powerful  and  centralized  computing  platforms 
located in clouds, which are then accessed over the wireless connection based on a thin 
native client. 

•  Mobile devices are connected to the mobile networks via base stations that establish 
and  control  the  connections  and  functional  interfaces  between  the  networks  and 
mobile devices. 

•  Mobile users’ requests and information are transmitted to the central processors that 

are connected to servers providing mobile network services. 

•  The subscribers’ requests are delivered to a cloud through the Internet.   

3.1 Mobility Platform 

Enterprise  mobility  management (EMM) is the set of people, processes and technology 
focused  on  managing  the  increasing  array  of  mobile  devices,  wireless  networks,  and 
related services to enable broad use of mobile computing in a business context. When we 
say  mobility  management  it  is  refer  to  the  management  for  mobility  of  the  device.  To 
perform  a  daily  transaction,  employees  maybe  move  from  one  place  to  another,  hence 
mobility is very important. This is an emerging discipline within the enterprise that has 
become  increasingly  important  over  the  past  few  years  as  more  workers  have  bought 
smartphone and tablet computing devices and have sought support for using these devices 
in the workplace [3][4].

mobile ERP application. The end user using the mobile devices can performtheir day to 
day transactions using the combination of cloud computing, mobile web ERP and mobile 
devices.This  shows  the  composition  of  the  mobile  enterprise  application.  These  are  the 
Enterprise connectors, Communication platform, mobile devices and storage or databases. 
Enterprise connectors are software,  middleware and also components  which are used to 
develop  the  applications.  Communication  platform,  are  the  communication  technology 
that support the mobility of the devices. Mobile devices are of course the devices; this can 
be smartphones, PDAs, tablets and etc. 

4    Optimized Mobile Cloud ERP 

The figure 4, illustrates the flow of the processes for customizing the existing ERP system. 
It is difficult for the developer to reprogram again the existing ERP system. Considering 
that the ERP systems are structured similar to each other, here we proposed a development 
of mobile ERP based on the Adaptive object model. The business requirements should be 
analyze by the service provider, then they can remodel the existing system.

4.1 Application of Adaptive Object Model (AOM) 
 
To provide customization support we proposed that the development of the mobile ERP 
application is based on the Adaptive Object Model (AOM). An Adaptive Object Model 
(AOM)  is  a  common  architectural  style  for  systems  in  which  classes,  attributes, 
relationships and behaviors of applications are represented as metadata, allowing them to 
be changed at runtime not only by programmers, but also by end users.Metadata resources, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.51 (ACIT 2014)320Copyright © 2014 SERSCsuch as annotations (Java), custom attributes (.NET), XML files, naming conventions and 
interfaces, can be used to identify specific points where the application can be extended to 
add specialized behavior expressed using source code.

The figure 5depicts the core design of an AOM. This design can change the relationship, 
attribute  and  behavior  of  the  existing  system  by  integrating  it  with  the  analysis  of  the 
business requirements, like for example the accountability entity and accountabilityType, 
by analyzing the business rule, we can restructure the existing entity and adapt the new 
entity the new attributes and constraints.
