1. Introduction 

Utility computing with cost-effective realization became the 
foundation  of    Cloud  computing  model  which  allows  users 
and providers to access the resources easily in a self-efficient  
manner,  with  pay-as-you-go  fashion,  thus  reducing  initial 
infrastructure  cost  and  improving  resource  utilization  by 
maximizing  the  effectiveness  of  resource.  Recently,  the 
Global  IT  ecosystem  and  new  markets  economy  are  greatly 
influenced by the impact of cloud computing which can meet 
the fluctuating and unpredictable business demands because 
of  its  achieving  coherence  and  economics  of  scale.  Thus 
considering  the  benefits  of  end  user,  usability  is  considered 
to be a vital attribute for measuring user satisfaction level in 
cloud  computing  environment.  So,  usability  can  be  defined 
as  the  process  of  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  shared 
resources with maximizing task efficiency, computing power 
so  as  to  ensure  user  need  and  satisfaction.  Effectiveness, 
efficiency,  and  satisfaction  are  considered  to  be  the  three 
main  goals  of  cloud  that  encourages  achieving  specified 
goals to specified users. So we can say a usable cloud always 
support  the  Users'  tasks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Usability 
evaluation  is  defined  as  systematic  process  of  collection  of 

data  and  makes  a  better  understanding  of  users  that  how  a 
user  can  use  the  cloud  service  to  perform  a  particular  task. 
To create cloud service, scientific observation, measurement 
and design principles are applied. These processes helps user 
to use cloud service easily at lower cost. 

2. Brief History of Usability Evaluation 

The  journey  of  usability  was  started  in  simple  environment 
but proceed to a complex environment. The term “usability” 
was  coined  in  the  late  1980s,  when  J.  Whiteside  (Digital 
Equipment  Corporation)  and  J.  Bennett  (IBM)  published 
several  articles  about  usability  engineering  [7].  In  2006  a 
study  on  usability  testing  done  by  Miller  [1],  [5]  where  he 
discussed  about  usability  testing  and  quality  assurance 
attribute.  From  his  publication  we  came  to  know  that 
usability  testing  should  be  performed  at  the  initial  stage  to 
overcome  the  problems  and  good  usability  testing  method 
can make the service faster. To measure a website in cloud, 
L.Fang  [2],  [5]  proposed  different  usability  evaluation 
methods.  Evaluation  methods  such  as  heuristic  evaluation, 
focus group cognitive walkthrough, and questionnaire can be 
adopted to measure the usability and in 2010, A. Lodhi, [3], 
[5] described usability heuristics as an assessment parameter

for  usability  testing  and  several  experiments  was  conducted 
to establish to justify his research. In 2012, L.Hasan [4], [5] 
performed  experiment  on  usability  evaluating  in  nine 
Jordanian  university  websites.  Some  usability  attribute  was 
taken  into  consideration  to  evaluate  the  usability  such  as 
easiness  of  usability,  architectural  design  and  informational 
content. 237 user were selected to perform a specific task on 
a  particular  website  and  provide  feedback  .From  their 
feedback a report was generated to measure their satisfaction 
level  of  users.  Google,  Yahoo,  Hotmail  and  IBM  are 
continuously  attempting  to  facilitate  the  users  through  more 
innovations. 

3.  Brief  History  of  Usability  Attributes, 
Benefits,  Challenges  of  Cloud  Computing 
Environment 

3.1. Usability Attribute 

According to J. Nielsen, usability is defined by the following 
five quality components [7], [8]. 

  Learnability:  It  defines  that  user's  capacity  of  learning 
quickly  and  easily  of  the  functionalities  of  a  product  to 
achieve goal of a certain tasks.  

  Efficiency:  It  defines  how  fast  users  are  accomplished 
different tasks and how effectively user can perform task 
to estimate the costs. 

  Memorability:  Memorability  defines  the  recollection 
capability  of  user  when  they  have  not  worked  with  the 
interface for a longer time. 

  Errors:  Users  make  many  errors  working  with  the  cloud 
service.  This  attributes  focuses  on  how  often  user  can 
make error and can they cope with problem with ease and 
comfort. This attribute is related with the effort for error 
correction  which  greatly  concern  of  recovery  from  error 
and robustness of device. 

  Satisfaction: It defines how user is satisfied after working 
with  the  Cloud  based  application  and  how  they  are 
concerned  with  the  time  of  execution.  Satisfaction  is 
measured by feedback of user's attitude, perceptions, and 
feelings about the service. 

3.2. Benefits of Usability Evaluation 

  Gaining Higher Level of Usage: Cloud services will be 
easy  to  use  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  their 
clients, and novice users can able to access the service 
offered [12]. 

  Lowering User Support Cost: Usable services help the 
customer to search the needed content and accomplish 
the  application.  The  cloud 
his/her  goals  with 
application interface,  operations   should 
be 
understandable  to  the  user  without  help  of  external 
intervention 
  thus  reducing  user  support  cost. 
Accuracy is key components of the content. Accuracy 
will decrease the probability of customer's complain to 
the  service  provider  about  the  quality  of  service 
offered [12]. 

 

  Impact  on  Usability  Engineering  Lifecycle:  Usability 
evaluation  should  influence  each  step  of  usability 
engineering.  In  engineering  lifecycle  process,  the 
usability  activity  is  minimal  in  case  of  requirement 

analysis  but  increases  during  the  development  phase. 
The discovery process of usability reduces the cost of 
redesigning  as  modification  is  applied  on  prototype 
[12]. 

  Impact of Usability on Return on Investment: From an 
economical  perspective,  cloud-computing  service 
allows  users  and  providers  access  to  resources  in  a 
self-service  manner  and  pay-as-you-go 
fashion. 
Usability  techniques  can  reduce  costs  (including 
development,  support,  training,  documentation  and 
maintenance  costs),  minimize  the  development  time, 
and improve marketability (Cheskin: 1999). Usability-
aware  organizations  maintain  the  thumb  rule  that  the 
cost  benefit  ratio  for  the  usability  is  $1:$10-$100.  If 
they  spent  one  dollar  for  implementing  usability 
techniques, the organization will get a benefit between 
$10 and $100 (Gilb T: 1998). Developing high quality 
cloud  applications  enhance  the  credibility  of  the 
application  manages  the  cloud  service  of  various 
organization  with  full  satisfaction  of  the  users  and 
clients [12]. 

3.3. Usability Challenges 

The followings are some challenges that generally the 
usability area faces: 

  Scalability: Scalability is one of the challenges of Cloud 
usability.  For  an  example  if  any  changes  done  by  Face 
book  (a  social  networking  site),  it  will  instantly  affect 
large  number  of  users.  However,  three  years  back  that 
affected fewer users. So scalability is an issue to usability 
of cloud computing [11]. 

  Visual  Design:  Visual  design  plays  an  important  role  of 
application  and  communication  with  user.  When  user 
pays their taxes or purchases an airline reservation ticket, 
need  simple  application  and  do  not  want  to  concentrate 
about  the  mechanics  of  interpreting  the  application’s 
screen.  Clear  and  concise  visual  design  will  need  to 
satisfy the user [11]. 
Interactivity:  One  of  the  major  challenges  for  cloud 
service provider is how the cloud service becomes more 
interactive to user [11]. 

 

  Dynamic  Application:  Dynamic  Application  is  a  most 
important  challenge  in  usability.  Designer  can  face 
serious negative outcome if changes are done incorrectly. 
The  problems  of  changes  mainly  affect  those  users  who 
use an application frequently [11]. 

4.  Needs  and  Design  Process  on  Usability  of 
Cloud 

On  the  cloud,  usability  is  an  essential  condition.  The 
useful  method  of  usability  is  user  testing,  which  are 
discussed here [9], [12].  

At  first,  some  users  should  be  selected  and  then  instruct 
the  users  to  perform  tasks  in  specific  cloud  platform. At 
last,  evaluator  observes  whether  user  does  the  work 
successfully  or  not  and  where  they  face  discomfort  with 
the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for

the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for 

64 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

the design process: 
Step  1.  Prototyping  a new requirement,  the design engineer 
have  to  identify  the  requirement  and  satisfaction  level  of 
user. 
Step  2.  To  get  more  quality  product  at  low  prices, 
developer  makes  a  comparison  with  competitors'  designs 
and  develops  more  quality  product  based  on  user 
requirement.  

Step  3.  Then  Evaluator  should  conduct  a  field  study  to 
observe user's behavior, their comfort and difficulties with 
the service.  

Step  4.After  that  evaluator  makes  paper  prototypes  of  
new design ideas.  

Step  5.Evaluator  refines  the  design  ideas  with  multiple 
iterations for  best result.  

Step 6. After implementation of the final design; test will 
be conducted to reduce the usability problems.  

5. Usability Assessment 

The basic steps of assessment are  

  It will predict whether usability will meet the target or 

not. 

  It will obtain feedback from user to improve design of 

product. 

  It will assess the targets that have been met. 

5.1. Centre of Interest of Usability Assessment 

Usability  assessment  depends  on 
the 
evaluation  and  the  assessment  concentrate  on  how  it 
works  well  on  different  aspects.  We  will  discuss  some 
important scenarios of usability assessment [10]. 

the  state  of 

5.1.1  Application's  Information  Content.  Usability 
assessment  is  greatly  depending  upon  the  informational 
content. Usability assessment is performed to evaluate the 
correctness  of  information,  designing  and  functionalities 
of the systems. 

5.1.2  User  Interface  Functionality.  Functionality  of  the 
user  interface  is  an  important      property  responsible  for 
the  application  of  presenting  components  of  the  user-
interface  relationship.  This  feature  helps  user  to  access 
different  information content  by browsing and navigating 
metrics. User can able to search, select, retrieve and store 
the information after successful navigation. 

5.1.3  Performance  of  User.  User  performance  is  most 
essential usability assessment and can be distinguished by 
two aspects. First, one is Effectiveness.  (Whether the user 
fetched  the  information  correctly  to  provide  the  correct 
outputs);  and  second  is  efficiency  (the  duration  that  user 
can achieve result or goal).                                         

5.1.4  Workload  Distributed  to  End  User.  This  factor 
depends  on  the  properties  and  attributes  of  task,  which 
performed  by  the  user.  The  outcome  of  tasks  determines 
the  user  performance  .Stress  is  a  big  factor  of  cognitive 
load  and  it  depends  on  individual  capability  to  learn  and 
to cope with fatigue. 

5.1.5  End  User  Satisfaction.  User  satisfaction 
is 
considered  a  vital  attribute  while  considering  usability 
issues. Though the system is efficient, or produces outputs 
effectively  but  the  user,  reaction  to  the  system  is  most 
important.  User  perseverance  is  determined  whether  the 
system will be accepted in use or not.  

5.1.6  Cost/benefit  Analysis.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis 
focuses  on  functionality  of  the  system  so  that  user  can 
achieve a satisfaction level    to carry his work at reasonable 
cost. 

5.2. Assessment Process of Usability 

Usability is considered as iterative methods that concentrate 
on  real  users  and  the  task  performed  by  them.  Variety  of 
techniques  is  involved  with  usability  engineering  and 
assessment. These techniques are described below: 
  Observations of user and task: Here the evaluator goes 
through  observation  performed  by  users  while 
attempting any task in their workplace and analysis of 
their  work  processes  evaluator  finds  their  mental 
satisfaction level [10]. 

  Interviews  and  questionnaires: A  set  of questionnaires 
are  prepared  before    conducting    an  interview  with 
users,  and  from  feedback  of  user  the  report    is 
generated based on user  preferences, experiences  and 
their needs.[10], [5], [8]. 

  Competitive  analysis  and  Benchmarking:  Evaluation 
of  usability  focuses  on  the  similar  products  that  are 
available  in  the  market.  Thus,  competitive  analysis  is 
performed  between  similar  product  to  provide  a 
beneficial usability study [10], [8], [5]. 

  Paper  prototyping:  In  this  process,  users  are  involved 
to  perform  the  task  in  the  rough  and  hand  sketched 
prototype  model,  before  beginning  of  actual  coding. 
Depending  on 
actual 
implementation is done [10], [8], and [5]. 

their  performance, 

the 

  Creation  of  guidelines:  This  includes  set  of  rules  and 
standard  guidelines,  which  may  be  followed  by 
designers  to  assure  consistency  in  design  of  the 
software during the design phase [10], [5]. 

  Usability testing: In this technique, user tests a product 
and provides feedback to evaluator. Evaluator analyzes 
their  feedback  to  find  out  problem  so  that  corrective 
measure can be taken [10], [8]. 

6. Evaluation Methods of Usability 
There  are  several  approaches  of  usability  evaluation 
methods. Some of them are discussed below:  

6.1.  Approaches  of  usability  evaluation  assessment 
methods: [5], [8], [10] 

6.1.1  Heuristic  Evaluation.  Evaluator  and  task  expert 
plays important  role in  heuristic methods[10,5].  It  can be 
considered  as  a  fast  process  and  economically  feasible. 
Evaluators  examine  the  user  interface  and  make  a 
comparison  study  with  established  heuristic  methods  to 
reduce the problem faced by user.

Abstract: In the field of service computing, cloud computing provides a scalable services and promising delivery platform. 
Although the specific future of cloud computing is hard to pin, but it has a vital impact in the present world of Information 
Technology and digitalized business world. The more usable the cloud is the more efficient will be its task performance and 
making  a  cloud  usable  is  Usability.  The  usability aspect is an  essential criterion to  design services in  an  interactive way to 
support the task performance efficiently, effectively and with least navigational time, which increases user satisfaction level. 
Usability experts have carried out various usability evaluation techniques and metrics (or user satisfaction metrics) which play 
a significant role in  cloud computing environment. Thus usability aspect became essential for designing cloud services and 
more interactive to support the user at their work. This paper mainly addresses the various usability techniques and evaluation 
assessment and issues that may be considered while evaluating the usability of cloud services.

1. Introduction 

Utility computing with cost-effective realization became the 
foundation  of    Cloud  computing  model  which  allows  users 
and providers to access the resources easily in a self-efficient  
manner,  with  pay-as-you-go  fashion,  thus  reducing  initial 
infrastructure  cost  and  improving  resource  utilization  by 
maximizing  the  effectiveness  of  resource.  Recently,  the 
Global  IT  ecosystem  and  new  markets  economy  are  greatly 
influenced by the impact of cloud computing which can meet 
the fluctuating and unpredictable business demands because 
of  its  achieving  coherence  and  economics  of  scale.  Thus 
considering  the  benefits  of  end  user,  usability  is  considered 
to be a vital attribute for measuring user satisfaction level in 
cloud  computing  environment.  So,  usability  can  be  defined 
as  the  process  of  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  shared 
resources with maximizing task efficiency, computing power 
so  as  to  ensure  user  need  and  satisfaction.  Effectiveness, 
efficiency,  and  satisfaction  are  considered  to  be  the  three 
main  goals  of  cloud  that  encourages  achieving  specified 
goals to specified users. So we can say a usable cloud always 
support  the  Users'  tasks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Usability 
evaluation  is  defined  as  systematic  process  of  collection  of 

data  and  makes  a  better  understanding  of  users  that  how  a 
user  can  use  the  cloud  service  to  perform  a  particular  task. 
To create cloud service, scientific observation, measurement 
and design principles are applied. These processes helps user 
to use cloud service easily at lower cost. 

2. Brief History of Usability Evaluation 

The  journey  of  usability  was  started  in  simple  environment 
but proceed to a complex environment. The term “usability” 
was  coined  in  the  late  1980s,  when  J.  Whiteside  (Digital 
Equipment  Corporation)  and  J.  Bennett  (IBM)  published 
several  articles  about  usability  engineering  [7].  In  2006  a 
study  on  usability  testing  done  by  Miller  [1],  [5]  where  he 
discussed  about  usability  testing  and  quality  assurance 
attribute.  From  his  publication  we  came  to  know  that 
usability  testing  should  be  performed  at  the  initial  stage  to 
overcome  the  problems  and  good  usability  testing  method 
can make the service faster. To measure a website in cloud, 
L.Fang  [2],  [5]  proposed  different  usability  evaluation 
methods.  Evaluation  methods  such  as  heuristic  evaluation, 
focus group cognitive walkthrough, and questionnaire can be 
adopted to measure the usability and in 2010, A. Lodhi, [3], 
[5] described usability heuristics as an assessment parameter

for  usability  testing  and  several  experiments  was  conducted 
to establish to justify his research. In 2012, L.Hasan [4], [5] 
performed  experiment  on  usability  evaluating  in  nine 
Jordanian  university  websites.  Some  usability  attribute  was 
taken  into  consideration  to  evaluate  the  usability  such  as 
easiness  of  usability,  architectural  design  and  informational 
content. 237 user were selected to perform a specific task on 
a  particular  website  and  provide  feedback  .From  their 
feedback a report was generated to measure their satisfaction 
level  of  users.  Google,  Yahoo,  Hotmail  and  IBM  are 
continuously  attempting  to  facilitate  the  users  through  more 
innovations. 

3.  Brief  History  of  Usability  Attributes, 
Benefits,  Challenges  of  Cloud  Computing 
Environment 

3.1. Usability Attribute 

According to J. Nielsen, usability is defined by the following 
five quality components [7], [8]. 

  Learnability:  It  defines  that  user's  capacity  of  learning 
quickly  and  easily  of  the  functionalities  of  a  product  to 
achieve goal of a certain tasks.  

  Efficiency:  It  defines  how  fast  users  are  accomplished 
different tasks and how effectively user can perform task 
to estimate the costs. 

  Memorability:  Memorability  defines  the  recollection 
capability  of  user  when  they  have  not  worked  with  the 
interface for a longer time. 

  Errors:  Users  make  many  errors  working  with  the  cloud 
service.  This  attributes  focuses  on  how  often  user  can 
make error and can they cope with problem with ease and 
comfort. This attribute is related with the effort for error 
correction  which  greatly  concern  of  recovery  from  error 
and robustness of device. 

  Satisfaction: It defines how user is satisfied after working 
with  the  Cloud  based  application  and  how  they  are 
concerned  with  the  time  of  execution.  Satisfaction  is 
measured by feedback of user's attitude, perceptions, and 
feelings about the service. 

3.2. Benefits of Usability Evaluation 

  Gaining Higher Level of Usage: Cloud services will be 
easy  to  use  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  their 
clients, and novice users can able to access the service 
offered [12]. 

  Lowering User Support Cost: Usable services help the 
customer to search the needed content and accomplish 
the  application.  The  cloud 
his/her  goals  with 
application interface,  operations   should 
be 
understandable  to  the  user  without  help  of  external 
intervention 
  thus  reducing  user  support  cost. 
Accuracy is key components of the content. Accuracy 
will decrease the probability of customer's complain to 
the  service  provider  about  the  quality  of  service 
offered [12]. 

 

  Impact  on  Usability  Engineering  Lifecycle:  Usability 
evaluation  should  influence  each  step  of  usability 
engineering.  In  engineering  lifecycle  process,  the 
usability  activity  is  minimal  in  case  of  requirement 

analysis  but  increases  during  the  development  phase. 
The discovery process of usability reduces the cost of 
redesigning  as  modification  is  applied  on  prototype 
[12]. 

  Impact of Usability on Return on Investment: From an 
economical  perspective,  cloud-computing  service 
allows  users  and  providers  access  to  resources  in  a 
self-service  manner  and  pay-as-you-go 
fashion. 
Usability  techniques  can  reduce  costs  (including 
development,  support,  training,  documentation  and 
maintenance  costs),  minimize  the  development  time, 
and improve marketability (Cheskin: 1999). Usability-
aware  organizations  maintain  the  thumb  rule  that  the 
cost  benefit  ratio  for  the  usability  is  $1:$10-$100.  If 
they  spent  one  dollar  for  implementing  usability 
techniques, the organization will get a benefit between 
$10 and $100 (Gilb T: 1998). Developing high quality 
cloud  applications  enhance  the  credibility  of  the 
application  manages  the  cloud  service  of  various 
organization  with  full  satisfaction  of  the  users  and 
clients [12]. 

3.3. Usability Challenges 

The followings are some challenges that generally the 
usability area faces: 

  Scalability: Scalability is one of the challenges of Cloud 
usability.  For  an  example  if  any  changes  done  by  Face 
book  (a  social  networking  site),  it  will  instantly  affect 
large  number  of  users.  However,  three  years  back  that 
affected fewer users. So scalability is an issue to usability 
of cloud computing [11]. 

  Visual  Design:  Visual  design  plays  an  important  role  of 
application  and  communication  with  user.  When  user 
pays their taxes or purchases an airline reservation ticket, 
need  simple  application  and  do  not  want  to  concentrate 
about  the  mechanics  of  interpreting  the  application’s 
screen.  Clear  and  concise  visual  design  will  need  to 
satisfy the user [11]. 
Interactivity:  One  of  the  major  challenges  for  cloud 
service provider is how the cloud service becomes more 
interactive to user [11]. 

 

  Dynamic  Application:  Dynamic  Application  is  a  most 
important  challenge  in  usability.  Designer  can  face 
serious negative outcome if changes are done incorrectly. 
The  problems  of  changes  mainly  affect  those  users  who 
use an application frequently [11]. 

4.  Needs  and  Design  Process  on  Usability  of 
Cloud 

On  the  cloud,  usability  is  an  essential  condition.  The 
useful  method  of  usability  is  user  testing,  which  are 
discussed here [9], [12].  

At  first,  some  users  should  be  selected  and  then  instruct 
the  users  to  perform  tasks  in  specific  cloud  platform. At 
last,  evaluator  observes  whether  user  does  the  work 
successfully  or  not  and  where  they  face  discomfort  with 
the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for 

64 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

the design process: 
Step  1.  Prototyping  a new requirement,  the design engineer 
have  to  identify  the  requirement  and  satisfaction  level  of 
user. 
Step  2.  To  get  more  quality  product  at  low  prices, 
developer  makes  a  comparison  with  competitors'  designs 
and  develops  more  quality  product  based  on  user 
requirement.  

Step  3.  Then  Evaluator  should  conduct  a  field  study  to 
observe user's behavior, their comfort and difficulties with 
the service.  

Step  4.After  that  evaluator  makes  paper  prototypes  of  
new design ideas.  

Step  5.Evaluator  refines  the  design  ideas  with  multiple 
iterations for  best result.  

Step 6. After implementation of the final design; test will 
be conducted to reduce the usability problems.  

5. Usability Assessment 

The basic steps of assessment are  

  It will predict whether usability will meet the target or 

not. 

  It will obtain feedback from user to improve design of 

product. 

  It will assess the targets that have been met. 

5.1. Centre of Interest of Usability Assessment 

Usability  assessment  depends  on 
the 
evaluation  and  the  assessment  concentrate  on  how  it 
works  well  on  different  aspects.  We  will  discuss  some 
important scenarios of usability assessment [10]. 

the  state  of 

5.1.1  Application's  Information  Content.  Usability 
assessment  is  greatly  depending  upon  the  informational 
content. Usability assessment is performed to evaluate the 
correctness  of  information,  designing  and  functionalities 
of the systems. 

5.1.2  User  Interface  Functionality.  Functionality  of  the 
user  interface  is  an  important      property  responsible  for 
the  application  of  presenting  components  of  the  user-
interface  relationship.  This  feature  helps  user  to  access 
different  information content  by browsing and navigating 
metrics. User can able to search, select, retrieve and store 
the information after successful navigation. 

5.1.3  Performance  of  User.  User  performance  is  most 
essential usability assessment and can be distinguished by 
two aspects. First, one is Effectiveness.  (Whether the user 
fetched  the  information  correctly  to  provide  the  correct 
outputs);  and  second  is  efficiency  (the  duration  that  user 
can achieve result or goal).                                         

5.1.4  Workload  Distributed  to  End  User.  This  factor 
depends  on  the  properties  and  attributes  of  task,  which 
performed  by  the  user.  The  outcome  of  tasks  determines 
the  user  performance  .Stress  is  a  big  factor  of  cognitive 
load  and  it  depends  on  individual  capability  to  learn  and 
to cope with fatigue. 

5.1.5  End  User  Satisfaction.  User  satisfaction 
is 
considered  a  vital  attribute  while  considering  usability 
issues. Though the system is efficient, or produces outputs 
effectively  but  the  user,  reaction  to  the  system  is  most 
important.  User  perseverance  is  determined  whether  the 
system will be accepted in use or not.  

5.1.6  Cost/benefit  Analysis.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis 
focuses  on  functionality  of  the  system  so  that  user  can 
achieve a satisfaction level    to carry his work at reasonable 
cost. 

5.2. Assessment Process of Usability 

Usability is considered as iterative methods that concentrate 
on  real  users  and  the  task  performed  by  them.  Variety  of 
techniques  is  involved  with  usability  engineering  and 
assessment. These techniques are described below: 
  Observations of user and task: Here the evaluator goes 
through  observation  performed  by  users  while 
attempting any task in their workplace and analysis of 
their  work  processes  evaluator  finds  their  mental 
satisfaction level [10]. 

  Interviews  and  questionnaires: A  set  of questionnaires 
are  prepared  before    conducting    an  interview  with 
users,  and  from  feedback  of  user  the  report    is 
generated based on user  preferences, experiences  and 
their needs.[10], [5], [8]. 

  Competitive  analysis  and  Benchmarking:  Evaluation 
of  usability  focuses  on  the  similar  products  that  are 
available  in  the  market.  Thus,  competitive  analysis  is 
performed  between  similar  product  to  provide  a 
beneficial usability study [10], [8], [5]. 

  Paper  prototyping:  In  this  process,  users  are  involved 
to  perform  the  task  in  the  rough  and  hand  sketched 
prototype  model,  before  beginning  of  actual  coding. 
Depending  on 
actual 
implementation is done [10], [8], and [5]. 

their  performance, 

the 

  Creation  of  guidelines:  This  includes  set  of  rules  and 
standard  guidelines,  which  may  be  followed  by 
designers  to  assure  consistency  in  design  of  the 
software during the design phase [10], [5]. 

  Usability testing: In this technique, user tests a product 
and provides feedback to evaluator. Evaluator analyzes 
their  feedback  to  find  out  problem  so  that  corrective 
measure can be taken [10], [8]. 

6. Evaluation Methods of Usability 
There  are  several  approaches  of  usability  evaluation 
methods. Some of them are discussed below:  

6.1.  Approaches  of  usability  evaluation  assessment 
methods: [5], [8], [10] 

6.1.1  Heuristic  Evaluation.  Evaluator  and  task  expert 
plays important  role in  heuristic methods[10,5].  It  can be 
considered  as  a  fast  process  and  economically  feasible. 
Evaluators  examine  the  user  interface  and  make  a 
comparison  study  with  established  heuristic  methods  to 
reduce the problem faced by user.  

65 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

6.1.2  User  Based  Evaluation.  This  method  mainly 
focuses  on  the  feedback  of  user  in  design  phase.  The 
partial/rapid prototypes are required in the design phase of 
usability  evaluations  which  will  create  complete  versions 
of the best quality product. 

needed  to  fix  errors,  iii)time    required  for    learning  
applications,  and  iv)features  and    functionality  of  the  
system.  At  first  a  benchmark  has  to  be  established  and 
then  to  determine  the  usability  of  other  system  by 
comparative study.  

6.1.3  Evaluation  Based  on  Design  Principal.  Design 
phase  has  a  great  contribution  and  impact  to  establish 
usability  evaluation 
.Collections  of  guidelines  and 
standards are essential for design criteria of evaluation of 
usability. 

6.1.4  Evaluation  Based  on  Assessment  Model.  It  is  a 
theoretical model that specifies human-computer interface 
and human abilities in usability.  This model is considered 
as generic models of industry specific. 

6.2. Different types of Usability Evaluation Methods: 

Usability  Evaluation  methods can be  categorized in three 
types:  Testing, Inspection and Inquiry. 

6.2.1 Testing. Usability testing is a method that associated 
with user interaction and is used to evaluate a product by 
testing.  In this method a set of user are needed to perform 
task of the prototype of a product. Feedback from user helps 
to understand the evaluator about user interface. Testing 
methods include the following: [10], [13]. 

6.2.1.1 Thinking Aloud Protocol: Think aloud method is a 
technique to accumulate data that can be used in usability 
scenario.  In  this  method  user  verbally  announce  their 
thought of tasks. Generally an instructor gives instruction 
to  the  user  to  be  more  verbal  at  time  of  working.  In 
“Think-Aloud” protocol, 
the 
participants 
opportunities 
their  feelings  which  helps 
usability specialist to analyze the users experience. 

to  express 

have 

6.2.1.2  Rapid  Iterative  Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE 
Method):  Another  important  usability  method  is  Rapid 
Iterative Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE)  method.  RITE  is 
an  iterative  method  of  usability  study.  The  tester  team 
focus  a  set  of  target  population  to  make  testing.  In  this 
method  particular  participant  is  chosen  for  a  task  on  a 
prototype  model  and  usability  engineer  based  on  their 
observation  collect  the  essential  data  for  the  participant. 
The  development  and  testing  team  decide  whether  there 
will  need  any  change  for  that  prototype  prior  to  the  next 
participant.  

6.2.1.3  Co-Discovery  Methods:  Co-discovery  method 
determines  that  usability  test  is  required  for  accumulate 
vital information from pairing of subjects. Discussion can 
help  to  find  out  the  problem  area  of  design  and 
documentation which is essential in usability study.  

6.2.1.4  Usability  Testing  Based  on  Component: 
Component-based  usability  testing is  used  for  interaction 
of component of a system and test the elementary unit of 
usability.  This  method  involves  quantitative  measure  of 
usability  which  is  based  on  user  interaction  by  interview 
and questionnaires. 

6.2.1.5  Benchmarking  Methods:  Benchmarking method 
determines the standard of design of the specific product. 
To establish a benchmark  four main  characteristics are to 
be  maintained  .i)Time  for  performing  the    task  ,ii)  time 

6.2.1.6  Coaching  Method:    In  this  technique  an  expert 
coach will  answer  the question of participants  best of his 
capability. Tester  observes  the  interaction  between  expert 
coach  and  user.  The  main  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
modify  the design of the product and make  it more  users 
friendly. 

in 

6.2.1.7  Remote  Testing:  Research  on  remote  usability 
evaluation  is  performed  with  the  user  and  the  evaluators 
located  in  separated  space  and  time.  Remote  testing  can 
be  divided 
two  categories  synchronous  and 
asynchronous.  Synchronous  usability  testing  is  related  to 
video  conferencing  or  employs  remote  application  that 
shares  the tools such as WebEx. And other one related to 
real  time  communication  between  the  evaluator  and 
participant user one to one. 

to 

6.2.1.8  Retrospective  Testing:  Sometimes  videotape  has 
been used for usability test session, and evaluator can able 
to  gather  information  by  reviewing  the  videotape  and 
make query to participants regarding their attitude during 
the  test.  The  main  requirement  for  this  technique  is  the 
user's  interaction  with  the  service  has  to  be  recorded  and 
replayed when necessary. 

6.2.1.9 Shadowing Method: In this method an expert user 
helps the tester during usability test .User performs in task 
domain  and  expert  user  explains 
the  attitude  and 
behaviour  of  normal  user  to  the  tester.  This  technique  is 
needed when tester are not able to communicate with user 
directly. 

6.2.2 Inspection. Usability inspection technique is mainly 
carried by usability specialists and software developers 
before usability test and this method helps the evaluator to 
resolve an issue related to usability. Some popular Inspection 
methods are: [10], [5]. 

6.2.2.1  Feature  Inspection:  Feature  inspection  technique 
concentrates  on  the  features  of  a  product.  In  this  method 
analysis  of  each  feature  is  needed  for  availability, 
understandability and functionality aspects of service. 

6.2.2.2 Perspective-based Inspection: Perspective-based 
inspections are used to broaden the problem-finding ability 
based on user perspectives. User can face different situations 
of interacting a new service or product [15].  

6.2.2.3  Pluralistic  walkthrough:  In  this  method  Experts 
and  specialists 
together  discuss  different  usability 
scenarios  and  try  to  find  optimizations  to  evaluate  a 
service or product [14].

Abstract: In the field of service computing, cloud computing provides a scalable services and promising delivery platform. 
Although the specific future of cloud computing is hard to pin, but it has a vital impact in the present world of Information 
Technology and digitalized business world. The more usable the cloud is the more efficient will be its task performance and 
making  a  cloud  usable  is  Usability.  The  usability aspect is an  essential criterion to  design services in  an  interactive way to 
support the task performance efficiently, effectively and with least navigational time, which increases user satisfaction level. 
Usability experts have carried out various usability evaluation techniques and metrics (or user satisfaction metrics) which play 
a significant role in  cloud computing environment. Thus usability aspect became essential for designing cloud services and 
more interactive to support the user at their work. This paper mainly addresses the various usability techniques and evaluation 
assessment and issues that may be considered while evaluating the usability of cloud services.

1. Introduction 

Utility computing with cost-effective realization became the 
foundation  of    Cloud  computing  model  which  allows  users 
and providers to access the resources easily in a self-efficient  
manner,  with  pay-as-you-go  fashion,  thus  reducing  initial 
infrastructure  cost  and  improving  resource  utilization  by 
maximizing  the  effectiveness  of  resource.  Recently,  the 
Global  IT  ecosystem  and  new  markets  economy  are  greatly 
influenced by the impact of cloud computing which can meet 
the fluctuating and unpredictable business demands because 
of  its  achieving  coherence  and  economics  of  scale.  Thus 
considering  the  benefits  of  end  user,  usability  is  considered 
to be a vital attribute for measuring user satisfaction level in 
cloud  computing  environment.  So,  usability  can  be  defined 
as  the  process  of  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  shared 
resources with maximizing task efficiency, computing power 
so  as  to  ensure  user  need  and  satisfaction.  Effectiveness, 
efficiency,  and  satisfaction  are  considered  to  be  the  three 
main  goals  of  cloud  that  encourages  achieving  specified 
goals to specified users. So we can say a usable cloud always 
support  the  Users'  tasks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Usability 
evaluation  is  defined  as  systematic  process  of  collection  of 

data  and  makes  a  better  understanding  of  users  that  how  a 
user  can  use  the  cloud  service  to  perform  a  particular  task. 
To create cloud service, scientific observation, measurement 
and design principles are applied. These processes helps user 
to use cloud service easily at lower cost. 

2. Brief History of Usability Evaluation 

The  journey  of  usability  was  started  in  simple  environment 
but proceed to a complex environment. The term “usability” 
was  coined  in  the  late  1980s,  when  J.  Whiteside  (Digital 
Equipment  Corporation)  and  J.  Bennett  (IBM)  published 
several  articles  about  usability  engineering  [7].  In  2006  a 
study  on  usability  testing  done  by  Miller  [1],  [5]  where  he 
discussed  about  usability  testing  and  quality  assurance 
attribute.  From  his  publication  we  came  to  know  that 
usability  testing  should  be  performed  at  the  initial  stage  to 
overcome  the  problems  and  good  usability  testing  method 
can make the service faster. To measure a website in cloud, 
L.Fang  [2],  [5]  proposed  different  usability  evaluation 
methods.  Evaluation  methods  such  as  heuristic  evaluation, 
focus group cognitive walkthrough, and questionnaire can be 
adopted to measure the usability and in 2010, A. Lodhi, [3], 
[5] described usability heuristics as an assessment parameter

for  usability  testing  and  several  experiments  was  conducted 
to establish to justify his research. In 2012, L.Hasan [4], [5] 
performed  experiment  on  usability  evaluating  in  nine 
Jordanian  university  websites.  Some  usability  attribute  was 
taken  into  consideration  to  evaluate  the  usability  such  as 
easiness  of  usability,  architectural  design  and  informational 
content. 237 user were selected to perform a specific task on 
a  particular  website  and  provide  feedback  .From  their 
feedback a report was generated to measure their satisfaction 
level  of  users.  Google,  Yahoo,  Hotmail  and  IBM  are 
continuously  attempting  to  facilitate  the  users  through  more 
innovations. 

3.  Brief  History  of  Usability  Attributes, 
Benefits,  Challenges  of  Cloud  Computing 
Environment 

3.1. Usability Attribute 

According to J. Nielsen, usability is defined by the following 
five quality components [7], [8]. 

  Learnability:  It  defines  that  user's  capacity  of  learning 
quickly  and  easily  of  the  functionalities  of  a  product  to 
achieve goal of a certain tasks.  

  Efficiency:  It  defines  how  fast  users  are  accomplished 
different tasks and how effectively user can perform task 
to estimate the costs. 

  Memorability:  Memorability  defines  the  recollection 
capability  of  user  when  they  have  not  worked  with  the 
interface for a longer time. 

  Errors:  Users  make  many  errors  working  with  the  cloud 
service.  This  attributes  focuses  on  how  often  user  can 
make error and can they cope with problem with ease and 
comfort. This attribute is related with the effort for error 
correction  which  greatly  concern  of  recovery  from  error 
and robustness of device. 

  Satisfaction: It defines how user is satisfied after working 
with  the  Cloud  based  application  and  how  they  are 
concerned  with  the  time  of  execution.  Satisfaction  is 
measured by feedback of user's attitude, perceptions, and 
feelings about the service. 

3.2. Benefits of Usability Evaluation 

  Gaining Higher Level of Usage: Cloud services will be 
easy  to  use  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  their 
clients, and novice users can able to access the service 
offered [12]. 

  Lowering User Support Cost: Usable services help the 
customer to search the needed content and accomplish 
the  application.  The  cloud 
his/her  goals  with 
application interface,  operations   should 
be 
understandable  to  the  user  without  help  of  external 
intervention 
  thus  reducing  user  support  cost. 
Accuracy is key components of the content. Accuracy 
will decrease the probability of customer's complain to 
the  service  provider  about  the  quality  of  service 
offered [12]. 

 

  Impact  on  Usability  Engineering  Lifecycle:  Usability 
evaluation  should  influence  each  step  of  usability 
engineering.  In  engineering  lifecycle  process,  the 
usability  activity  is  minimal  in  case  of  requirement 

analysis  but  increases  during  the  development  phase. 
The discovery process of usability reduces the cost of 
redesigning  as  modification  is  applied  on  prototype 
[12]. 

  Impact of Usability on Return on Investment: From an 
economical  perspective,  cloud-computing  service 
allows  users  and  providers  access  to  resources  in  a 
self-service  manner  and  pay-as-you-go 
fashion. 
Usability  techniques  can  reduce  costs  (including 
development,  support,  training,  documentation  and 
maintenance  costs),  minimize  the  development  time, 
and improve marketability (Cheskin: 1999). Usability-
aware  organizations  maintain  the  thumb  rule  that  the 
cost  benefit  ratio  for  the  usability  is  $1:$10-$100.  If 
they  spent  one  dollar  for  implementing  usability 
techniques, the organization will get a benefit between 
$10 and $100 (Gilb T: 1998). Developing high quality 
cloud  applications  enhance  the  credibility  of  the 
application  manages  the  cloud  service  of  various 
organization  with  full  satisfaction  of  the  users  and 
clients [12]. 

3.3. Usability Challenges 

The followings are some challenges that generally the 
usability area faces: 

  Scalability: Scalability is one of the challenges of Cloud 
usability.  For  an  example  if  any  changes  done  by  Face 
book  (a  social  networking  site),  it  will  instantly  affect 
large  number  of  users.  However,  three  years  back  that 
affected fewer users. So scalability is an issue to usability 
of cloud computing [11]. 

  Visual  Design:  Visual  design  plays  an  important  role  of 
application  and  communication  with  user.  When  user 
pays their taxes or purchases an airline reservation ticket, 
need  simple  application  and  do  not  want  to  concentrate 
about  the  mechanics  of  interpreting  the  application’s 
screen.  Clear  and  concise  visual  design  will  need  to 
satisfy the user [11]. 
Interactivity:  One  of  the  major  challenges  for  cloud 
service provider is how the cloud service becomes more 
interactive to user [11]. 

 

  Dynamic  Application:  Dynamic  Application  is  a  most 
important  challenge  in  usability.  Designer  can  face 
serious negative outcome if changes are done incorrectly. 
The  problems  of  changes  mainly  affect  those  users  who 
use an application frequently [11]. 

4.  Needs  and  Design  Process  on  Usability  of 
Cloud 

On  the  cloud,  usability  is  an  essential  condition.  The 
useful  method  of  usability  is  user  testing,  which  are 
discussed here [9], [12].  

At  first,  some  users  should  be  selected  and  then  instruct 
the  users  to  perform  tasks  in  specific  cloud  platform. At 
last,  evaluator  observes  whether  user  does  the  work 
successfully  or  not  and  where  they  face  discomfort  with 
the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for 

64 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

the design process: 
Step  1.  Prototyping  a new requirement,  the design engineer 
have  to  identify  the  requirement  and  satisfaction  level  of 
user. 
Step  2.  To  get  more  quality  product  at  low  prices, 
developer  makes  a  comparison  with  competitors'  designs 
and  develops  more  quality  product  based  on  user 
requirement.  

Step  3.  Then  Evaluator  should  conduct  a  field  study  to 
observe user's behavior, their comfort and difficulties with 
the service.  

Step  4.After  that  evaluator  makes  paper  prototypes  of  
new design ideas.  

Step  5.Evaluator  refines  the  design  ideas  with  multiple 
iterations for  best result.  

Step 6. After implementation of the final design; test will 
be conducted to reduce the usability problems.  

5. Usability Assessment 

The basic steps of assessment are  

  It will predict whether usability will meet the target or 

not. 

  It will obtain feedback from user to improve design of 

product. 

  It will assess the targets that have been met. 

5.1. Centre of Interest of Usability Assessment 

Usability  assessment  depends  on 
the 
evaluation  and  the  assessment  concentrate  on  how  it 
works  well  on  different  aspects.  We  will  discuss  some 
important scenarios of usability assessment [10]. 

the  state  of 

5.1.1  Application's  Information  Content.  Usability 
assessment  is  greatly  depending  upon  the  informational 
content. Usability assessment is performed to evaluate the 
correctness  of  information,  designing  and  functionalities 
of the systems. 

5.1.2  User  Interface  Functionality.  Functionality  of  the 
user  interface  is  an  important      property  responsible  for 
the  application  of  presenting  components  of  the  user-
interface  relationship.  This  feature  helps  user  to  access 
different  information content  by browsing and navigating 
metrics. User can able to search, select, retrieve and store 
the information after successful navigation. 

5.1.3  Performance  of  User.  User  performance  is  most 
essential usability assessment and can be distinguished by 
two aspects. First, one is Effectiveness.  (Whether the user 
fetched  the  information  correctly  to  provide  the  correct 
outputs);  and  second  is  efficiency  (the  duration  that  user 
can achieve result or goal).                                         

5.1.4  Workload  Distributed  to  End  User.  This  factor 
depends  on  the  properties  and  attributes  of  task,  which 
performed  by  the  user.  The  outcome  of  tasks  determines 
the  user  performance  .Stress  is  a  big  factor  of  cognitive 
load  and  it  depends  on  individual  capability  to  learn  and 
to cope with fatigue. 

5.1.5  End  User  Satisfaction.  User  satisfaction 
is 
considered  a  vital  attribute  while  considering  usability 
issues. Though the system is efficient, or produces outputs 
effectively  but  the  user,  reaction  to  the  system  is  most 
important.  User  perseverance  is  determined  whether  the 
system will be accepted in use or not.  

5.1.6  Cost/benefit  Analysis.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis 
focuses  on  functionality  of  the  system  so  that  user  can 
achieve a satisfaction level    to carry his work at reasonable 
cost. 

5.2. Assessment Process of Usability 

Usability is considered as iterative methods that concentrate 
on  real  users  and  the  task  performed  by  them.  Variety  of 
techniques  is  involved  with  usability  engineering  and 
assessment. These techniques are described below: 
  Observations of user and task: Here the evaluator goes 
through  observation  performed  by  users  while 
attempting any task in their workplace and analysis of 
their  work  processes  evaluator  finds  their  mental 
satisfaction level [10]. 

  Interviews  and  questionnaires: A  set  of questionnaires 
are  prepared  before    conducting    an  interview  with 
users,  and  from  feedback  of  user  the  report    is 
generated based on user  preferences, experiences  and 
their needs.[10], [5], [8]. 

  Competitive  analysis  and  Benchmarking:  Evaluation 
of  usability  focuses  on  the  similar  products  that  are 
available  in  the  market.  Thus,  competitive  analysis  is 
performed  between  similar  product  to  provide  a 
beneficial usability study [10], [8], [5]. 

  Paper  prototyping:  In  this  process,  users  are  involved 
to  perform  the  task  in  the  rough  and  hand  sketched 
prototype  model,  before  beginning  of  actual  coding. 
Depending  on 
actual 
implementation is done [10], [8], and [5]. 

their  performance, 

the 

  Creation  of  guidelines:  This  includes  set  of  rules  and 
standard  guidelines,  which  may  be  followed  by 
designers  to  assure  consistency  in  design  of  the 
software during the design phase [10], [5]. 

  Usability testing: In this technique, user tests a product 
and provides feedback to evaluator. Evaluator analyzes 
their  feedback  to  find  out  problem  so  that  corrective 
measure can be taken [10], [8]. 

6. Evaluation Methods of Usability 
There  are  several  approaches  of  usability  evaluation 
methods. Some of them are discussed below:  

6.1.  Approaches  of  usability  evaluation  assessment 
methods: [5], [8], [10] 

6.1.1  Heuristic  Evaluation.  Evaluator  and  task  expert 
plays important  role in  heuristic methods[10,5].  It  can be 
considered  as  a  fast  process  and  economically  feasible. 
Evaluators  examine  the  user  interface  and  make  a 
comparison  study  with  established  heuristic  methods  to 
reduce the problem faced by user.  

65 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

6.1.2  User  Based  Evaluation.  This  method  mainly 
focuses  on  the  feedback  of  user  in  design  phase.  The 
partial/rapid prototypes are required in the design phase of 
usability  evaluations  which  will  create  complete  versions 
of the best quality product. 

needed  to  fix  errors,  iii)time    required  for    learning  
applications,  and  iv)features  and    functionality  of  the  
system.  At  first  a  benchmark  has  to  be  established  and 
then  to  determine  the  usability  of  other  system  by 
comparative study.  

6.1.3  Evaluation  Based  on  Design  Principal.  Design 
phase  has  a  great  contribution  and  impact  to  establish 
usability  evaluation 
.Collections  of  guidelines  and 
standards are essential for design criteria of evaluation of 
usability. 

6.1.4  Evaluation  Based  on  Assessment  Model.  It  is  a 
theoretical model that specifies human-computer interface 
and human abilities in usability.  This model is considered 
as generic models of industry specific. 

6.2. Different types of Usability Evaluation Methods: 

Usability  Evaluation  methods can be  categorized in three 
types:  Testing, Inspection and Inquiry. 

6.2.1 Testing. Usability testing is a method that associated 
with user interaction and is used to evaluate a product by 
testing.  In this method a set of user are needed to perform 
task of the prototype of a product. Feedback from user helps 
to understand the evaluator about user interface. Testing 
methods include the following: [10], [13]. 

6.2.1.1 Thinking Aloud Protocol: Think aloud method is a 
technique to accumulate data that can be used in usability 
scenario.  In  this  method  user  verbally  announce  their 
thought of tasks. Generally an instructor gives instruction 
to  the  user  to  be  more  verbal  at  time  of  working.  In 
“Think-Aloud” protocol, 
the 
participants 
opportunities 
their  feelings  which  helps 
usability specialist to analyze the users experience. 

to  express 

have 

6.2.1.2  Rapid  Iterative  Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE 
Method):  Another  important  usability  method  is  Rapid 
Iterative Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE)  method.  RITE  is 
an  iterative  method  of  usability  study.  The  tester  team 
focus  a  set  of  target  population  to  make  testing.  In  this 
method  particular  participant  is  chosen  for  a  task  on  a 
prototype  model  and  usability  engineer  based  on  their 
observation  collect  the  essential  data  for  the  participant. 
The  development  and  testing  team  decide  whether  there 
will  need  any  change  for  that  prototype  prior  to  the  next 
participant.  

6.2.1.3  Co-Discovery  Methods:  Co-discovery  method 
determines  that  usability  test  is  required  for  accumulate 
vital information from pairing of subjects. Discussion can 
help  to  find  out  the  problem  area  of  design  and 
documentation which is essential in usability study.  

6.2.1.4  Usability  Testing  Based  on  Component: 
Component-based  usability  testing is  used  for  interaction 
of component of a system and test the elementary unit of 
usability.  This  method  involves  quantitative  measure  of 
usability  which  is  based  on  user  interaction  by  interview 
and questionnaires. 

6.2.1.5  Benchmarking  Methods:  Benchmarking method 
determines the standard of design of the specific product. 
To establish a benchmark  four main  characteristics are to 
be  maintained  .i)Time  for  performing  the    task  ,ii)  time 

6.2.1.6  Coaching  Method:    In  this  technique  an  expert 
coach will  answer  the question of participants  best of his 
capability. Tester  observes  the  interaction  between  expert 
coach  and  user.  The  main  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
modify  the design of the product and make  it more  users 
friendly. 

in 

6.2.1.7  Remote  Testing:  Research  on  remote  usability 
evaluation  is  performed  with  the  user  and  the  evaluators 
located  in  separated  space  and  time.  Remote  testing  can 
be  divided 
two  categories  synchronous  and 
asynchronous.  Synchronous  usability  testing  is  related  to 
video  conferencing  or  employs  remote  application  that 
shares  the tools such as WebEx. And other one related to 
real  time  communication  between  the  evaluator  and 
participant user one to one. 

to 

6.2.1.8  Retrospective  Testing:  Sometimes  videotape  has 
been used for usability test session, and evaluator can able 
to  gather  information  by  reviewing  the  videotape  and 
make query to participants regarding their attitude during 
the  test.  The  main  requirement  for  this  technique  is  the 
user's  interaction  with  the  service  has  to  be  recorded  and 
replayed when necessary. 

6.2.1.9 Shadowing Method: In this method an expert user 
helps the tester during usability test .User performs in task 
domain  and  expert  user  explains 
the  attitude  and 
behaviour  of  normal  user  to  the  tester.  This  technique  is 
needed when tester are not able to communicate with user 
directly. 

6.2.2 Inspection. Usability inspection technique is mainly 
carried by usability specialists and software developers 
before usability test and this method helps the evaluator to 
resolve an issue related to usability. Some popular Inspection 
methods are: [10], [5]. 

6.2.2.1  Feature  Inspection:  Feature  inspection  technique 
concentrates  on  the  features  of  a  product.  In  this  method 
analysis  of  each  feature  is  needed  for  availability, 
understandability and functionality aspects of service. 

6.2.2.2 Perspective-based Inspection: Perspective-based 
inspections are used to broaden the problem-finding ability 
based on user perspectives. User can face different situations 
of interacting a new service or product [15].  

6.2.2.3  Pluralistic  walkthrough:  In  this  method  Experts 
and  specialists 
together  discuss  different  usability 
scenarios  and  try  to  find  optimizations  to  evaluate  a 
service or product [14].  

6.2.2.4  Cognitive  walkthrough:  Cognitive  walkthrough 
technique  is  used  to  detect  any  usability  problems  and 
make  the  service  easy  for  novice  user.  This  method  is 
under  usability  inspection  methods.  Experts  emulate  the 
user’s thoughts and concern when solving problems.    

6.2.3 Inquiry.The main objective of usability evaluators is 
to concern about user feedback. Users' facility, discomfort, 
necessity, and understand ability of a new system are very 

66 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

important for evaluators. Observing the user attitude and 
discussing with them evaluator perform the task of 
evaluation. Inquiry methods comprise the following methods 
[10], [8], [16]. 

6.2.3.1  Field  Observation:  Evaluator  will  physically 
present  at  the  workplace  and  observe  the  task  of 
representative  user.  Evaluators  try  to  understand  how  the 
user deals with the system. 

6.2.3.2  Focus  Groups:  In  this  method,  a  group  of 
representative  user  are  selected  by  evaluators  to  collect 
data and find out the issues of the service. Evaluator plays 
the role of moderator, who prepares the list of issues from 
the  discussion  with  user. This  method  able to  capture  the 
spontaneous  user  reactions  that  evolves  in  the  process  of 
dynamic group. 

6.2.3.2  Interviews  and  Questionnaires  [13]:  In  this 
method,  evaluator  prepares  a  set  of  questions  about  the 
product  and  they  interview  to  the  users  from  these 
questions in order to gather information. In an evaluation 
interview  technique,  user  answers  the  question  verbally, 
and the interviewer records those responses. There are two 
types of interview:  unstructured interview and structured 
interview. 

  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Structured  interviewing:  In  this  method  there  are  a 
predetermined  and  specific  agenda  and  a  set  of 
specific  questions  are  prepared,  a  guidelines  are 
maintained when interrogation going on. There are two 
types of Questionnaire methods. 

  Pre-test  Questionnaire:  Pre-test  questionnaire  requires 
various  attribute  to  perform  the  test,  such  as  first 
impressions of user about a product, user information.  

  Post-test Questionnaire.  This  process  is done after the 
completion  of  the  task  successfully.  User  provides 
their  opinions  and  feelings  of  that  service  after 
completing their works 

7. Cloud Usability Metrics 

There are some metrics which are based on statistical and   
countable 
information.  Countable  metrics  can  be 
constructed from raw data that are collected from various 
log,  video  recording,  interview  and  questionnaires.  We 
will  discuss  10  metrics  which  are  used  for  usability 
evaluation [5], [8], [6], [17]. 
  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Completion Rates:  Completion rate can be considered 
as  a  basic  usability  metric.  It  can  be  determined  as 
gateway metric also. It can be represented as a binary 
metric (1 can be considered as Success of task and 0 is 
treated as failure of task.) 

  Usability Problems: It is considered as a key metric for 
measuring usability activity. This focuses the problem 

which is done by user while using the cloud service or 
web service. It also describes severity ratings of those 
problems. 

  Task  Time:  It  is  one  of  the  important  key  metric  that 
can be used to measure the efficiency and productivity 
of cloud and web service. Total task time defines how 
long  a  user  takes  to  complete  a  task. Task  time  is  the 
duration between a Start task times and end task time. 

  Task  Level  Satisfaction:  When  user  completes  a  task 
his  or  her  feedback  is  essential  to  determine  the 
satisfaction and difficulty level of tasks. 

  Test  Level  Satisfaction:  An 

is 

interview 

to  be 
conducted  with  users  at  the  end  of  usability  test  and 
from the feedback of the user, tester determine the ease 
of usability.  System Usability Scale (SUS) is required 
for  testing  of  software,  hardware  and  devices  .The 
SUS  is  technology  independent  and is  very  simple 
which  provides  global  view  of subjective  assessments 
of usability. 

  Errors: Error  may  be  encountered  by  user  by  doing 
wrong action, omission and mistakes while performing 
a job. Description of error along with each instance is 
recorded  which  is  helpful  in  Usability  Inspection 
problems. 

  User Expectation: It is based on the expectation of user 
about  the  difficulty  level  of  a  task  .A  comparison  is 
done  between  the  expectation  of  user  about  difficulty 
of  task  and  actual  difficulty  of  task.  (Experiment 
conducted on set of user). 

  Page  Views/Clicks:   This  metric  is  specially  needed 
for  web-applications  and  cloud  application.  Only  this 
fundamental metrics user can able to access.  Clicks or 
page view determines  success  rate or failure of a task 
.This  metrics  is  used  for  better  measurement  of 
efficiency of web or cloud service. 
  Conversion:  Conversion  metric 

the 
measurement  of  the  effectiveness  of  a  product.  It  is 
essential  metric  used  in  e-Commerce.  Usability  of 
conversion  rates  is  used  in  all  phases  of  the  sales 
process  by  focusing  on  the  usability  problems,  errors 
and reduces time.

Abstract: In the field of service computing, cloud computing provides a scalable services and promising delivery platform. 
Although the specific future of cloud computing is hard to pin, but it has a vital impact in the present world of Information 
Technology and digitalized business world. The more usable the cloud is the more efficient will be its task performance and 
making  a  cloud  usable  is  Usability.  The  usability aspect is an  essential criterion to  design services in  an  interactive way to 
support the task performance efficiently, effectively and with least navigational time, which increases user satisfaction level. 
Usability experts have carried out various usability evaluation techniques and metrics (or user satisfaction metrics) which play 
a significant role in  cloud computing environment. Thus usability aspect became essential for designing cloud services and 
more interactive to support the user at their work. This paper mainly addresses the various usability techniques and evaluation 
assessment and issues that may be considered while evaluating the usability of cloud services.

1. Introduction 

Utility computing with cost-effective realization became the 
foundation  of    Cloud  computing  model  which  allows  users 
and providers to access the resources easily in a self-efficient  
manner,  with  pay-as-you-go  fashion,  thus  reducing  initial 
infrastructure  cost  and  improving  resource  utilization  by 
maximizing  the  effectiveness  of  resource.  Recently,  the 
Global  IT  ecosystem  and  new  markets  economy  are  greatly 
influenced by the impact of cloud computing which can meet 
the fluctuating and unpredictable business demands because 
of  its  achieving  coherence  and  economics  of  scale.  Thus 
considering  the  benefits  of  end  user,  usability  is  considered 
to be a vital attribute for measuring user satisfaction level in 
cloud  computing  environment.  So,  usability  can  be  defined 
as  the  process  of  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  shared 
resources with maximizing task efficiency, computing power 
so  as  to  ensure  user  need  and  satisfaction.  Effectiveness, 
efficiency,  and  satisfaction  are  considered  to  be  the  three 
main  goals  of  cloud  that  encourages  achieving  specified 
goals to specified users. So we can say a usable cloud always 
support  the  Users'  tasks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Usability 
evaluation  is  defined  as  systematic  process  of  collection  of 

data  and  makes  a  better  understanding  of  users  that  how  a 
user  can  use  the  cloud  service  to  perform  a  particular  task. 
To create cloud service, scientific observation, measurement 
and design principles are applied. These processes helps user 
to use cloud service easily at lower cost. 

2. Brief History of Usability Evaluation 

The  journey  of  usability  was  started  in  simple  environment 
but proceed to a complex environment. The term “usability” 
was  coined  in  the  late  1980s,  when  J.  Whiteside  (Digital 
Equipment  Corporation)  and  J.  Bennett  (IBM)  published 
several  articles  about  usability  engineering  [7].  In  2006  a 
study  on  usability  testing  done  by  Miller  [1],  [5]  where  he 
discussed  about  usability  testing  and  quality  assurance 
attribute.  From  his  publication  we  came  to  know  that 
usability  testing  should  be  performed  at  the  initial  stage  to 
overcome  the  problems  and  good  usability  testing  method 
can make the service faster. To measure a website in cloud, 
L.Fang  [2],  [5]  proposed  different  usability  evaluation 
methods.  Evaluation  methods  such  as  heuristic  evaluation, 
focus group cognitive walkthrough, and questionnaire can be 
adopted to measure the usability and in 2010, A. Lodhi, [3], 
[5] described usability heuristics as an assessment parameter

for  usability  testing  and  several  experiments  was  conducted 
to establish to justify his research. In 2012, L.Hasan [4], [5] 
performed  experiment  on  usability  evaluating  in  nine 
Jordanian  university  websites.  Some  usability  attribute  was 
taken  into  consideration  to  evaluate  the  usability  such  as 
easiness  of  usability,  architectural  design  and  informational 
content. 237 user were selected to perform a specific task on 
a  particular  website  and  provide  feedback  .From  their 
feedback a report was generated to measure their satisfaction 
level  of  users.  Google,  Yahoo,  Hotmail  and  IBM  are 
continuously  attempting  to  facilitate  the  users  through  more 
innovations. 

3.  Brief  History  of  Usability  Attributes, 
Benefits,  Challenges  of  Cloud  Computing 
Environment 

3.1. Usability Attribute 

According to J. Nielsen, usability is defined by the following 
five quality components [7], [8]. 

  Learnability:  It  defines  that  user's  capacity  of  learning 
quickly  and  easily  of  the  functionalities  of  a  product  to 
achieve goal of a certain tasks.  

  Efficiency:  It  defines  how  fast  users  are  accomplished 
different tasks and how effectively user can perform task 
to estimate the costs. 

  Memorability:  Memorability  defines  the  recollection 
capability  of  user  when  they  have  not  worked  with  the 
interface for a longer time. 

  Errors:  Users  make  many  errors  working  with  the  cloud 
service.  This  attributes  focuses  on  how  often  user  can 
make error and can they cope with problem with ease and 
comfort. This attribute is related with the effort for error 
correction  which  greatly  concern  of  recovery  from  error 
and robustness of device. 

  Satisfaction: It defines how user is satisfied after working 
with  the  Cloud  based  application  and  how  they  are 
concerned  with  the  time  of  execution.  Satisfaction  is 
measured by feedback of user's attitude, perceptions, and 
feelings about the service. 

3.2. Benefits of Usability Evaluation 

  Gaining Higher Level of Usage: Cloud services will be 
easy  to  use  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  their 
clients, and novice users can able to access the service 
offered [12]. 

  Lowering User Support Cost: Usable services help the 
customer to search the needed content and accomplish 
the  application.  The  cloud 
his/her  goals  with 
application interface,  operations   should 
be 
understandable  to  the  user  without  help  of  external 
intervention 
  thus  reducing  user  support  cost. 
Accuracy is key components of the content. Accuracy 
will decrease the probability of customer's complain to 
the  service  provider  about  the  quality  of  service 
offered [12]. 

 

  Impact  on  Usability  Engineering  Lifecycle:  Usability 
evaluation  should  influence  each  step  of  usability 
engineering.  In  engineering  lifecycle  process,  the 
usability  activity  is  minimal  in  case  of  requirement 

analysis  but  increases  during  the  development  phase. 
The discovery process of usability reduces the cost of 
redesigning  as  modification  is  applied  on  prototype 
[12]. 

  Impact of Usability on Return on Investment: From an 
economical  perspective,  cloud-computing  service 
allows  users  and  providers  access  to  resources  in  a 
self-service  manner  and  pay-as-you-go 
fashion. 
Usability  techniques  can  reduce  costs  (including 
development,  support,  training,  documentation  and 
maintenance  costs),  minimize  the  development  time, 
and improve marketability (Cheskin: 1999). Usability-
aware  organizations  maintain  the  thumb  rule  that  the 
cost  benefit  ratio  for  the  usability  is  $1:$10-$100.  If 
they  spent  one  dollar  for  implementing  usability 
techniques, the organization will get a benefit between 
$10 and $100 (Gilb T: 1998). Developing high quality 
cloud  applications  enhance  the  credibility  of  the 
application  manages  the  cloud  service  of  various 
organization  with  full  satisfaction  of  the  users  and 
clients [12]. 

3.3. Usability Challenges 

The followings are some challenges that generally the 
usability area faces: 

  Scalability: Scalability is one of the challenges of Cloud 
usability.  For  an  example  if  any  changes  done  by  Face 
book  (a  social  networking  site),  it  will  instantly  affect 
large  number  of  users.  However,  three  years  back  that 
affected fewer users. So scalability is an issue to usability 
of cloud computing [11]. 

  Visual  Design:  Visual  design  plays  an  important  role  of 
application  and  communication  with  user.  When  user 
pays their taxes or purchases an airline reservation ticket, 
need  simple  application  and  do  not  want  to  concentrate 
about  the  mechanics  of  interpreting  the  application’s 
screen.  Clear  and  concise  visual  design  will  need  to 
satisfy the user [11]. 
Interactivity:  One  of  the  major  challenges  for  cloud 
service provider is how the cloud service becomes more 
interactive to user [11]. 

 

  Dynamic  Application:  Dynamic  Application  is  a  most 
important  challenge  in  usability.  Designer  can  face 
serious negative outcome if changes are done incorrectly. 
The  problems  of  changes  mainly  affect  those  users  who 
use an application frequently [11]. 

4.  Needs  and  Design  Process  on  Usability  of 
Cloud 

On  the  cloud,  usability  is  an  essential  condition.  The 
useful  method  of  usability  is  user  testing,  which  are 
discussed here [9], [12].  

At  first,  some  users  should  be  selected  and  then  instruct 
the  users  to  perform  tasks  in  specific  cloud  platform. At 
last,  evaluator  observes  whether  user  does  the  work 
successfully  or  not  and  where  they  face  discomfort  with 
the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for 

64 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

the design process: 
Step  1.  Prototyping  a new requirement,  the design engineer 
have  to  identify  the  requirement  and  satisfaction  level  of 
user. 
Step  2.  To  get  more  quality  product  at  low  prices, 
developer  makes  a  comparison  with  competitors'  designs 
and  develops  more  quality  product  based  on  user 
requirement.  

Step  3.  Then  Evaluator  should  conduct  a  field  study  to 
observe user's behavior, their comfort and difficulties with 
the service.  

Step  4.After  that  evaluator  makes  paper  prototypes  of  
new design ideas.  

Step  5.Evaluator  refines  the  design  ideas  with  multiple 
iterations for  best result.  

Step 6. After implementation of the final design; test will 
be conducted to reduce the usability problems.  

5. Usability Assessment 

The basic steps of assessment are  

  It will predict whether usability will meet the target or 

not. 

  It will obtain feedback from user to improve design of 

product. 

  It will assess the targets that have been met. 

5.1. Centre of Interest of Usability Assessment 

Usability  assessment  depends  on 
the 
evaluation  and  the  assessment  concentrate  on  how  it 
works  well  on  different  aspects.  We  will  discuss  some 
important scenarios of usability assessment [10]. 

the  state  of 

5.1.1  Application's  Information  Content.  Usability 
assessment  is  greatly  depending  upon  the  informational 
content. Usability assessment is performed to evaluate the 
correctness  of  information,  designing  and  functionalities 
of the systems. 

5.1.2  User  Interface  Functionality.  Functionality  of  the 
user  interface  is  an  important      property  responsible  for 
the  application  of  presenting  components  of  the  user-
interface  relationship.  This  feature  helps  user  to  access 
different  information content  by browsing and navigating 
metrics. User can able to search, select, retrieve and store 
the information after successful navigation. 

5.1.3  Performance  of  User.  User  performance  is  most 
essential usability assessment and can be distinguished by 
two aspects. First, one is Effectiveness.  (Whether the user 
fetched  the  information  correctly  to  provide  the  correct 
outputs);  and  second  is  efficiency  (the  duration  that  user 
can achieve result or goal).                                         

5.1.4  Workload  Distributed  to  End  User.  This  factor 
depends  on  the  properties  and  attributes  of  task,  which 
performed  by  the  user.  The  outcome  of  tasks  determines 
the  user  performance  .Stress  is  a  big  factor  of  cognitive 
load  and  it  depends  on  individual  capability  to  learn  and 
to cope with fatigue. 

5.1.5  End  User  Satisfaction.  User  satisfaction 
is 
considered  a  vital  attribute  while  considering  usability 
issues. Though the system is efficient, or produces outputs 
effectively  but  the  user,  reaction  to  the  system  is  most 
important.  User  perseverance  is  determined  whether  the 
system will be accepted in use or not.  

5.1.6  Cost/benefit  Analysis.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis 
focuses  on  functionality  of  the  system  so  that  user  can 
achieve a satisfaction level    to carry his work at reasonable 
cost. 

5.2. Assessment Process of Usability 

Usability is considered as iterative methods that concentrate 
on  real  users  and  the  task  performed  by  them.  Variety  of 
techniques  is  involved  with  usability  engineering  and 
assessment. These techniques are described below: 
  Observations of user and task: Here the evaluator goes 
through  observation  performed  by  users  while 
attempting any task in their workplace and analysis of 
their  work  processes  evaluator  finds  their  mental 
satisfaction level [10]. 

  Interviews  and  questionnaires: A  set  of questionnaires 
are  prepared  before    conducting    an  interview  with 
users,  and  from  feedback  of  user  the  report    is 
generated based on user  preferences, experiences  and 
their needs.[10], [5], [8]. 

  Competitive  analysis  and  Benchmarking:  Evaluation 
of  usability  focuses  on  the  similar  products  that  are 
available  in  the  market.  Thus,  competitive  analysis  is 
performed  between  similar  product  to  provide  a 
beneficial usability study [10], [8], [5]. 

  Paper  prototyping:  In  this  process,  users  are  involved 
to  perform  the  task  in  the  rough  and  hand  sketched 
prototype  model,  before  beginning  of  actual  coding. 
Depending  on 
actual 
implementation is done [10], [8], and [5]. 

their  performance, 

the 

  Creation  of  guidelines:  This  includes  set  of  rules  and 
standard  guidelines,  which  may  be  followed  by 
designers  to  assure  consistency  in  design  of  the 
software during the design phase [10], [5]. 

  Usability testing: In this technique, user tests a product 
and provides feedback to evaluator. Evaluator analyzes 
their  feedback  to  find  out  problem  so  that  corrective 
measure can be taken [10], [8]. 

6. Evaluation Methods of Usability 
There  are  several  approaches  of  usability  evaluation 
methods. Some of them are discussed below:  

6.1.  Approaches  of  usability  evaluation  assessment 
methods: [5], [8], [10] 

6.1.1  Heuristic  Evaluation.  Evaluator  and  task  expert 
plays important  role in  heuristic methods[10,5].  It  can be 
considered  as  a  fast  process  and  economically  feasible. 
Evaluators  examine  the  user  interface  and  make  a 
comparison  study  with  established  heuristic  methods  to 
reduce the problem faced by user.  

65 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

6.1.2  User  Based  Evaluation.  This  method  mainly 
focuses  on  the  feedback  of  user  in  design  phase.  The 
partial/rapid prototypes are required in the design phase of 
usability  evaluations  which  will  create  complete  versions 
of the best quality product. 

needed  to  fix  errors,  iii)time    required  for    learning  
applications,  and  iv)features  and    functionality  of  the  
system.  At  first  a  benchmark  has  to  be  established  and 
then  to  determine  the  usability  of  other  system  by 
comparative study.  

6.1.3  Evaluation  Based  on  Design  Principal.  Design 
phase  has  a  great  contribution  and  impact  to  establish 
usability  evaluation 
.Collections  of  guidelines  and 
standards are essential for design criteria of evaluation of 
usability. 

6.1.4  Evaluation  Based  on  Assessment  Model.  It  is  a 
theoretical model that specifies human-computer interface 
and human abilities in usability.  This model is considered 
as generic models of industry specific. 

6.2. Different types of Usability Evaluation Methods: 

Usability  Evaluation  methods can be  categorized in three 
types:  Testing, Inspection and Inquiry. 

6.2.1 Testing. Usability testing is a method that associated 
with user interaction and is used to evaluate a product by 
testing.  In this method a set of user are needed to perform 
task of the prototype of a product. Feedback from user helps 
to understand the evaluator about user interface. Testing 
methods include the following: [10], [13]. 

6.2.1.1 Thinking Aloud Protocol: Think aloud method is a 
technique to accumulate data that can be used in usability 
scenario.  In  this  method  user  verbally  announce  their 
thought of tasks. Generally an instructor gives instruction 
to  the  user  to  be  more  verbal  at  time  of  working.  In 
“Think-Aloud” protocol, 
the 
participants 
opportunities 
their  feelings  which  helps 
usability specialist to analyze the users experience. 

to  express 

have 

6.2.1.2  Rapid  Iterative  Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE 
Method):  Another  important  usability  method  is  Rapid 
Iterative Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE)  method.  RITE  is 
an  iterative  method  of  usability  study.  The  tester  team 
focus  a  set  of  target  population  to  make  testing.  In  this 
method  particular  participant  is  chosen  for  a  task  on  a 
prototype  model  and  usability  engineer  based  on  their 
observation  collect  the  essential  data  for  the  participant. 
The  development  and  testing  team  decide  whether  there 
will  need  any  change  for  that  prototype  prior  to  the  next 
participant.  

6.2.1.3  Co-Discovery  Methods:  Co-discovery  method 
determines  that  usability  test  is  required  for  accumulate 
vital information from pairing of subjects. Discussion can 
help  to  find  out  the  problem  area  of  design  and 
documentation which is essential in usability study.  

6.2.1.4  Usability  Testing  Based  on  Component: 
Component-based  usability  testing is  used  for  interaction 
of component of a system and test the elementary unit of 
usability.  This  method  involves  quantitative  measure  of 
usability  which  is  based  on  user  interaction  by  interview 
and questionnaires. 

6.2.1.5  Benchmarking  Methods:  Benchmarking method 
determines the standard of design of the specific product. 
To establish a benchmark  four main  characteristics are to 
be  maintained  .i)Time  for  performing  the    task  ,ii)  time 

6.2.1.6  Coaching  Method:    In  this  technique  an  expert 
coach will  answer  the question of participants  best of his 
capability. Tester  observes  the  interaction  between  expert 
coach  and  user.  The  main  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
modify  the design of the product and make  it more  users 
friendly. 

in 

6.2.1.7  Remote  Testing:  Research  on  remote  usability 
evaluation  is  performed  with  the  user  and  the  evaluators 
located  in  separated  space  and  time.  Remote  testing  can 
be  divided 
two  categories  synchronous  and 
asynchronous.  Synchronous  usability  testing  is  related  to 
video  conferencing  or  employs  remote  application  that 
shares  the tools such as WebEx. And other one related to 
real  time  communication  between  the  evaluator  and 
participant user one to one. 

to 

6.2.1.8  Retrospective  Testing:  Sometimes  videotape  has 
been used for usability test session, and evaluator can able 
to  gather  information  by  reviewing  the  videotape  and 
make query to participants regarding their attitude during 
the  test.  The  main  requirement  for  this  technique  is  the 
user's  interaction  with  the  service  has  to  be  recorded  and 
replayed when necessary. 

6.2.1.9 Shadowing Method: In this method an expert user 
helps the tester during usability test .User performs in task 
domain  and  expert  user  explains 
the  attitude  and 
behaviour  of  normal  user  to  the  tester.  This  technique  is 
needed when tester are not able to communicate with user 
directly. 

6.2.2 Inspection. Usability inspection technique is mainly 
carried by usability specialists and software developers 
before usability test and this method helps the evaluator to 
resolve an issue related to usability. Some popular Inspection 
methods are: [10], [5]. 

6.2.2.1  Feature  Inspection:  Feature  inspection  technique 
concentrates  on  the  features  of  a  product.  In  this  method 
analysis  of  each  feature  is  needed  for  availability, 
understandability and functionality aspects of service. 

6.2.2.2 Perspective-based Inspection: Perspective-based 
inspections are used to broaden the problem-finding ability 
based on user perspectives. User can face different situations 
of interacting a new service or product [15].  

6.2.2.3  Pluralistic  walkthrough:  In  this  method  Experts 
and  specialists 
together  discuss  different  usability 
scenarios  and  try  to  find  optimizations  to  evaluate  a 
service or product [14].  

6.2.2.4  Cognitive  walkthrough:  Cognitive  walkthrough 
technique  is  used  to  detect  any  usability  problems  and 
make  the  service  easy  for  novice  user.  This  method  is 
under  usability  inspection  methods.  Experts  emulate  the 
user’s thoughts and concern when solving problems.    

6.2.3 Inquiry.The main objective of usability evaluators is 
to concern about user feedback. Users' facility, discomfort, 
necessity, and understand ability of a new system are very 

66 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

important for evaluators. Observing the user attitude and 
discussing with them evaluator perform the task of 
evaluation. Inquiry methods comprise the following methods 
[10], [8], [16]. 

6.2.3.1  Field  Observation:  Evaluator  will  physically 
present  at  the  workplace  and  observe  the  task  of 
representative  user.  Evaluators  try  to  understand  how  the 
user deals with the system. 

6.2.3.2  Focus  Groups:  In  this  method,  a  group  of 
representative  user  are  selected  by  evaluators  to  collect 
data and find out the issues of the service. Evaluator plays 
the role of moderator, who prepares the list of issues from 
the  discussion  with  user. This  method  able to  capture  the 
spontaneous  user  reactions  that  evolves  in  the  process  of 
dynamic group. 

6.2.3.2  Interviews  and  Questionnaires  [13]:  In  this 
method,  evaluator  prepares  a  set  of  questions  about  the 
product  and  they  interview  to  the  users  from  these 
questions in order to gather information. In an evaluation 
interview  technique,  user  answers  the  question  verbally, 
and the interviewer records those responses. There are two 
types of interview:  unstructured interview and structured 
interview. 

  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Structured  interviewing:  In  this  method  there  are  a 
predetermined  and  specific  agenda  and  a  set  of 
specific  questions  are  prepared,  a  guidelines  are 
maintained when interrogation going on. There are two 
types of Questionnaire methods. 

  Pre-test  Questionnaire:  Pre-test  questionnaire  requires 
various  attribute  to  perform  the  test,  such  as  first 
impressions of user about a product, user information.  

  Post-test Questionnaire.  This  process  is done after the 
completion  of  the  task  successfully.  User  provides 
their  opinions  and  feelings  of  that  service  after 
completing their works 

7. Cloud Usability Metrics 

There are some metrics which are based on statistical and   
countable 
information.  Countable  metrics  can  be 
constructed from raw data that are collected from various 
log,  video  recording,  interview  and  questionnaires.  We 
will  discuss  10  metrics  which  are  used  for  usability 
evaluation [5], [8], [6], [17]. 
  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Completion Rates:  Completion rate can be considered 
as  a  basic  usability  metric.  It  can  be  determined  as 
gateway metric also. It can be represented as a binary 
metric (1 can be considered as Success of task and 0 is 
treated as failure of task.) 

  Usability Problems: It is considered as a key metric for 
measuring usability activity. This focuses the problem 

which is done by user while using the cloud service or 
web service. It also describes severity ratings of those 
problems. 

  Task  Time:  It  is  one  of  the  important  key  metric  that 
can be used to measure the efficiency and productivity 
of cloud and web service. Total task time defines how 
long  a  user  takes  to  complete  a  task. Task  time  is  the 
duration between a Start task times and end task time. 

  Task  Level  Satisfaction:  When  user  completes  a  task 
his  or  her  feedback  is  essential  to  determine  the 
satisfaction and difficulty level of tasks. 

  Test  Level  Satisfaction:  An 

is 

interview 

to  be 
conducted  with  users  at  the  end  of  usability  test  and 
from the feedback of the user, tester determine the ease 
of usability.  System Usability Scale (SUS) is required 
for  testing  of  software,  hardware  and  devices  .The 
SUS  is  technology  independent  and is  very  simple 
which  provides  global  view  of subjective  assessments 
of usability. 

  Errors: Error  may  be  encountered  by  user  by  doing 
wrong action, omission and mistakes while performing 
a job. Description of error along with each instance is 
recorded  which  is  helpful  in  Usability  Inspection 
problems. 

  User Expectation: It is based on the expectation of user 
about  the  difficulty  level  of  a  task  .A  comparison  is 
done  between  the  expectation  of  user  about  difficulty 
of  task  and  actual  difficulty  of  task.  (Experiment 
conducted on set of user). 

  Page  Views/Clicks:   This  metric  is  specially  needed 
for  web-applications  and  cloud  application.  Only  this 
fundamental metrics user can able to access.  Clicks or 
page view determines  success  rate or failure of a task 
.This  metrics  is  used  for  better  measurement  of 
efficiency of web or cloud service. 
  Conversion:  Conversion  metric 

the 
measurement  of  the  effectiveness  of  a  product.  It  is 
essential  metric  used  in  e-Commerce.  Usability  of 
conversion  rates  is  used  in  all  phases  of  the  sales 
process  by  focusing  on  the  usability  problems,  errors 
and reduces time. 

is  used  for 

of 

efficiency, 

  Single  Usability  Metric  (SUM):  This  metric  is  the 
combination of four usability metrics respectively  task 
completion  rate,  average  number  of  errors,  average 
time on task and post-task satisfaction .  This metrics is 
summation 
and 
satisfaction. 
Standard  Units  of  Measure  (SUoM)  is  metric  is 
particularly  used 
for  cloud  evaluation.  Service 
provider  and  vendors  provide  cloud  metric  that 
relevant  to  business  needs.  To  manage  the  cloud 
services  following  metrics  are  to  be  considered  [13], 
[6], and [18]. 

effectiveness 

  Costing  of  Cloud  percentage  of  Revenue:  It  describes 
the costing price of cloud that is related to revenue of 
business. 

  Cloud  Cost 

based 

on  Application/Business 
perspectives: The main aim of this metric to maximize 
business  profit  at  low  cost.   Cloud  Cost  related  to  per 
Transaction of business infrastructure.

  DiskRead time: This metric is required to identify the 

rate at which the application reads a disk. 

  DiskWrite time: This metric is required to identify the 

rate at which the application writes to a disk. 

  Average    Load  Time:  It  considered    the  load  time  to 

upload video and image 

  File CRUD Times: The time required to Create, Read, 

and Update or Delete a file of fixed size.  

  Database  CRUD  Times:  Average  time  required  to 
execute the commands to create, read, update or delete 
file from desired cloud database.  

  Average  &  Peak  CPU  Utilization:  It  is  a  crucial 
matrices which depends on how much percentage CPU 
is      computed  in  cloud  environment  and  how  many 
instance is currently running. 

  CPU Performance Variance: It defines the consistency 
level of CPU performance and also defines how cloud 
virtualization is responsible for CPU cycles. 

  Network-In:  This  metrics  identifies  number  of  bytes 

received in all network interfaces by the instance. 

  Network-Out: This  metrics  identifies  number  of  bytes 

sent in all network interfaces by the instance. 

8. Conclusion 

Today the World Wide Web gain huge popularity because of 
various  services  provided  to  the  user  in  the  field  of  cloud 
computing  and  human  computer  interface.  Thus,  usability 
becomes  a  vital  attribute  for  measuring  user  satisfaction 
level,  which  may  further  improve  the  performance  and 
effectiveness  of  software  product  as  well  as  web  cloud. 
Usability  can  be  considered  as  an  attribute  to  measure  the 
intelligence  of  Cloud  while  performing  the  task  in  order  to 
achieve  the  user’s  goal  and  needs.  In  this  paper  we 
summarize  usability  evaluation  techniques,  assessment  and 
issue  related  to  cloud  computing  services.  The  users' 
performance  in  the  cloud  environment  can  improve  the 
quality  of  cloud  service  .The  user  performance  in  the  cloud 
environment  can  improve  the  quality  of  the  cloud  service 
which leads to increase in ROI and user satisfaction level.

Abstract: In the field of service computing, cloud computing provides a scalable services and promising delivery platform. 
Although the specific future of cloud computing is hard to pin, but it has a vital impact in the present world of Information 
Technology and digitalized business world. The more usable the cloud is the more efficient will be its task performance and 
making  a  cloud  usable  is  Usability.  The  usability aspect is an  essential criterion to  design services in  an  interactive way to 
support the task performance efficiently, effectively and with least navigational time, which increases user satisfaction level. 
Usability experts have carried out various usability evaluation techniques and metrics (or user satisfaction metrics) which play 
a significant role in  cloud computing environment. Thus usability aspect became essential for designing cloud services and 
more interactive to support the user at their work. This paper mainly addresses the various usability techniques and evaluation 
assessment and issues that may be considered while evaluating the usability of cloud services. 

Keywords: Usability Metrics, Usability Evaluation Techniques, Cloud Computing Environment

1. Introduction 

Utility computing with cost-effective realization became the 
foundation  of    Cloud  computing  model  which  allows  users 
and providers to access the resources easily in a self-efficient  
manner,  with  pay-as-you-go  fashion,  thus  reducing  initial 
infrastructure  cost  and  improving  resource  utilization  by 
maximizing  the  effectiveness  of  resource.  Recently,  the 
Global  IT  ecosystem  and  new  markets  economy  are  greatly 
influenced by the impact of cloud computing which can meet 
the fluctuating and unpredictable business demands because 
of  its  achieving  coherence  and  economics  of  scale.  Thus 
considering  the  benefits  of  end  user,  usability  is  considered 
to be a vital attribute for measuring user satisfaction level in 
cloud  computing  environment.  So,  usability  can  be  defined 
as  the  process  of  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  shared 
resources with maximizing task efficiency, computing power 
so  as  to  ensure  user  need  and  satisfaction.  Effectiveness, 
efficiency,  and  satisfaction  are  considered  to  be  the  three 
main  goals  of  cloud  that  encourages  achieving  specified 
goals to specified users. So we can say a usable cloud always 
support  the  Users'  tasks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Usability 
evaluation  is  defined  as  systematic  process  of  collection  of 

data  and  makes  a  better  understanding  of  users  that  how  a 
user  can  use  the  cloud  service  to  perform  a  particular  task. 
To create cloud service, scientific observation, measurement 
and design principles are applied. These processes helps user 
to use cloud service easily at lower cost. 

2. Brief History of Usability Evaluation 

The  journey  of  usability  was  started  in  simple  environment 
but proceed to a complex environment. The term “usability” 
was  coined  in  the  late  1980s,  when  J.  Whiteside  (Digital 
Equipment  Corporation)  and  J.  Bennett  (IBM)  published 
several  articles  about  usability  engineering  [7].  In  2006  a 
study  on  usability  testing  done  by  Miller  [1],  [5]  where  he 
discussed  about  usability  testing  and  quality  assurance 
attribute.  From  his  publication  we  came  to  know  that 
usability  testing  should  be  performed  at  the  initial  stage  to 
overcome  the  problems  and  good  usability  testing  method 
can make the service faster. To measure a website in cloud, 
L.Fang  [2],  [5]  proposed  different  usability  evaluation 
methods.  Evaluation  methods  such  as  heuristic  evaluation, 
focus group cognitive walkthrough, and questionnaire can be 
adopted to measure the usability and in 2010, A. Lodhi, [3], 
[5] described usability heuristics as an assessment parameter

for  usability  testing  and  several  experiments  was  conducted 
to establish to justify his research. In 2012, L.Hasan [4], [5] 
performed  experiment  on  usability  evaluating  in  nine 
Jordanian  university  websites.  Some  usability  attribute  was 
taken  into  consideration  to  evaluate  the  usability  such  as 
easiness  of  usability,  architectural  design  and  informational 
content. 237 user were selected to perform a specific task on 
a  particular  website  and  provide  feedback  .From  their 
feedback a report was generated to measure their satisfaction 
level  of  users.  Google,  Yahoo,  Hotmail  and  IBM  are 
continuously  attempting  to  facilitate  the  users  through  more 
innovations. 

3.  Brief  History  of  Usability  Attributes, 
Benefits,  Challenges  of  Cloud  Computing 
Environment 

3.1. Usability Attribute 

According to J. Nielsen, usability is defined by the following 
five quality components [7], [8]. 

  Learnability:  It  defines  that  user's  capacity  of  learning 
quickly  and  easily  of  the  functionalities  of  a  product  to 
achieve goal of a certain tasks.  

  Efficiency:  It  defines  how  fast  users  are  accomplished 
different tasks and how effectively user can perform task 
to estimate the costs. 

  Memorability:  Memorability  defines  the  recollection 
capability  of  user  when  they  have  not  worked  with  the 
interface for a longer time. 

  Errors:  Users  make  many  errors  working  with  the  cloud 
service.  This  attributes  focuses  on  how  often  user  can 
make error and can they cope with problem with ease and 
comfort. This attribute is related with the effort for error 
correction  which  greatly  concern  of  recovery  from  error 
and robustness of device. 

  Satisfaction: It defines how user is satisfied after working 
with  the  Cloud  based  application  and  how  they  are 
concerned  with  the  time  of  execution.  Satisfaction  is 
measured by feedback of user's attitude, perceptions, and 
feelings about the service. 

3.2. Benefits of Usability Evaluation 

  Gaining Higher Level of Usage: Cloud services will be 
easy  to  use  and  meeting  the  expectations  of  their 
clients, and novice users can able to access the service 
offered [12]. 

  Lowering User Support Cost: Usable services help the 
customer to search the needed content and accomplish 
the  application.  The  cloud 
his/her  goals  with 
application interface,  operations   should 
be 
understandable  to  the  user  without  help  of  external 
intervention 
  thus  reducing  user  support  cost. 
Accuracy is key components of the content. Accuracy 
will decrease the probability of customer's complain to 
the  service  provider  about  the  quality  of  service 
offered [12]. 

 

  Impact  on  Usability  Engineering  Lifecycle:  Usability 
evaluation  should  influence  each  step  of  usability 
engineering.  In  engineering  lifecycle  process,  the 
usability  activity  is  minimal  in  case  of  requirement 

analysis  but  increases  during  the  development  phase. 
The discovery process of usability reduces the cost of 
redesigning  as  modification  is  applied  on  prototype 
[12]. 

  Impact of Usability on Return on Investment: From an 
economical  perspective,  cloud-computing  service 
allows  users  and  providers  access  to  resources  in  a 
self-service  manner  and  pay-as-you-go 
fashion. 
Usability  techniques  can  reduce  costs  (including 
development,  support,  training,  documentation  and 
maintenance  costs),  minimize  the  development  time, 
and improve marketability (Cheskin: 1999). Usability-
aware  organizations  maintain  the  thumb  rule  that  the 
cost  benefit  ratio  for  the  usability  is  $1:$10-$100.  If 
they  spent  one  dollar  for  implementing  usability 
techniques, the organization will get a benefit between 
$10 and $100 (Gilb T: 1998). Developing high quality 
cloud  applications  enhance  the  credibility  of  the 
application  manages  the  cloud  service  of  various 
organization  with  full  satisfaction  of  the  users  and 
clients [12]. 

3.3. Usability Challenges 

The followings are some challenges that generally the 
usability area faces: 

  Scalability: Scalability is one of the challenges of Cloud 
usability.  For  an  example  if  any  changes  done  by  Face 
book  (a  social  networking  site),  it  will  instantly  affect 
large  number  of  users.  However,  three  years  back  that 
affected fewer users. So scalability is an issue to usability 
of cloud computing [11]. 

  Visual  Design:  Visual  design  plays  an  important  role  of 
application  and  communication  with  user.  When  user 
pays their taxes or purchases an airline reservation ticket, 
need  simple  application  and  do  not  want  to  concentrate 
about  the  mechanics  of  interpreting  the  application’s 
screen.  Clear  and  concise  visual  design  will  need  to 
satisfy the user [11]. 
Interactivity:  One  of  the  major  challenges  for  cloud 
service provider is how the cloud service becomes more 
interactive to user [11]. 

 

  Dynamic  Application:  Dynamic  Application  is  a  most 
important  challenge  in  usability.  Designer  can  face 
serious negative outcome if changes are done incorrectly. 
The  problems  of  changes  mainly  affect  those  users  who 
use an application frequently [11]. 

4.  Needs  and  Design  Process  on  Usability  of 
Cloud 

On  the  cloud,  usability  is  an  essential  condition.  The 
useful  method  of  usability  is  user  testing,  which  are 
discussed here [9], [12].  

At  first,  some  users  should  be  selected  and  then  instruct 
the  users  to  perform  tasks  in  specific  cloud  platform. At 
last,  evaluator  observes  whether  user  does  the  work 
successfully  or  not  and  where  they  face  discomfort  with 
the user interface. 

Usability  plays  a  vital  role  in  each  stage  of  the  design 
process of creating cloud. Following steps are performed for 

64 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

the design process: 
Step  1.  Prototyping  a new requirement,  the design engineer 
have  to  identify  the  requirement  and  satisfaction  level  of 
user. 
Step  2.  To  get  more  quality  product  at  low  prices, 
developer  makes  a  comparison  with  competitors'  designs 
and  develops  more  quality  product  based  on  user 
requirement.  

Step  3.  Then  Evaluator  should  conduct  a  field  study  to 
observe user's behavior, their comfort and difficulties with 
the service.  

Step  4.After  that  evaluator  makes  paper  prototypes  of  
new design ideas.  

Step  5.Evaluator  refines  the  design  ideas  with  multiple 
iterations for  best result.  

Step 6. After implementation of the final design; test will 
be conducted to reduce the usability problems.  

5. Usability Assessment 

The basic steps of assessment are  

  It will predict whether usability will meet the target or 

not. 

  It will obtain feedback from user to improve design of 

product. 

  It will assess the targets that have been met. 

5.1. Centre of Interest of Usability Assessment 

Usability  assessment  depends  on 
the 
evaluation  and  the  assessment  concentrate  on  how  it 
works  well  on  different  aspects.  We  will  discuss  some 
important scenarios of usability assessment [10]. 

the  state  of 

5.1.1  Application's  Information  Content.  Usability 
assessment  is  greatly  depending  upon  the  informational 
content. Usability assessment is performed to evaluate the 
correctness  of  information,  designing  and  functionalities 
of the systems. 

5.1.2  User  Interface  Functionality.  Functionality  of  the 
user  interface  is  an  important      property  responsible  for 
the  application  of  presenting  components  of  the  user-
interface  relationship.  This  feature  helps  user  to  access 
different  information content  by browsing and navigating 
metrics. User can able to search, select, retrieve and store 
the information after successful navigation. 

5.1.3  Performance  of  User.  User  performance  is  most 
essential usability assessment and can be distinguished by 
two aspects. First, one is Effectiveness.  (Whether the user 
fetched  the  information  correctly  to  provide  the  correct 
outputs);  and  second  is  efficiency  (the  duration  that  user 
can achieve result or goal).                                         

5.1.4  Workload  Distributed  to  End  User.  This  factor 
depends  on  the  properties  and  attributes  of  task,  which 
performed  by  the  user.  The  outcome  of  tasks  determines 
the  user  performance  .Stress  is  a  big  factor  of  cognitive 
load  and  it  depends  on  individual  capability  to  learn  and 
to cope with fatigue. 

5.1.5  End  User  Satisfaction.  User  satisfaction 
is 
considered  a  vital  attribute  while  considering  usability 
issues. Though the system is efficient, or produces outputs 
effectively  but  the  user,  reaction  to  the  system  is  most 
important.  User  perseverance  is  determined  whether  the 
system will be accepted in use or not.  

5.1.6  Cost/benefit  Analysis.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis 
focuses  on  functionality  of  the  system  so  that  user  can 
achieve a satisfaction level    to carry his work at reasonable 
cost. 

5.2. Assessment Process of Usability 

Usability is considered as iterative methods that concentrate 
on  real  users  and  the  task  performed  by  them.  Variety  of 
techniques  is  involved  with  usability  engineering  and 
assessment. These techniques are described below: 
  Observations of user and task: Here the evaluator goes 
through  observation  performed  by  users  while 
attempting any task in their workplace and analysis of 
their  work  processes  evaluator  finds  their  mental 
satisfaction level [10]. 

  Interviews  and  questionnaires: A  set  of questionnaires 
are  prepared  before    conducting    an  interview  with 
users,  and  from  feedback  of  user  the  report    is 
generated based on user  preferences, experiences  and 
their needs.[10], [5], [8]. 

  Competitive  analysis  and  Benchmarking:  Evaluation 
of  usability  focuses  on  the  similar  products  that  are 
available  in  the  market.  Thus,  competitive  analysis  is 
performed  between  similar  product  to  provide  a 
beneficial usability study [10], [8], [5]. 

  Paper  prototyping:  In  this  process,  users  are  involved 
to  perform  the  task  in  the  rough  and  hand  sketched 
prototype  model,  before  beginning  of  actual  coding. 
Depending  on 
actual 
implementation is done [10], [8], and [5].

  Creation  of  guidelines:  This  includes  set  of  rules  and 
standard  guidelines,  which  may  be  followed  by 
designers  to  assure  consistency  in  design  of  the 
software during the design phase [10], [5]. 

  Usability testing: In this technique, user tests a product 
and provides feedback to evaluator. Evaluator analyzes 
their  feedback  to  find  out  problem  so  that  corrective 
measure can be taken [10], [8]. 

6. Evaluation Methods of Usability 
There  are  several  approaches  of  usability  evaluation 
methods. Some of them are discussed below:  

6.1.  Approaches  of  usability  evaluation  assessment 
methods: [5], [8], [10] 

6.1.1  Heuristic  Evaluation.  Evaluator  and  task  expert 
plays important  role in  heuristic methods[10,5].  It  can be 
considered  as  a  fast  process  and  economically  feasible. 
Evaluators  examine  the  user  interface  and  make  a 
comparison  study  with  established  heuristic  methods  to 
reduce the problem faced by user.

6.1.2  User  Based  Evaluation.  This  method  mainly 
focuses  on  the  feedback  of  user  in  design  phase.  The 
partial/rapid prototypes are required in the design phase of 
usability  evaluations  which  will  create  complete  versions 
of the best quality product. 

needed  to  fix  errors,  iii)time    required  for    learning  
applications,  and  iv)features  and    functionality  of  the  
system.  At  first  a  benchmark  has  to  be  established  and 
then  to  determine  the  usability  of  other  system  by 
comparative study.  

6.1.3  Evaluation  Based  on  Design  Principal.  Design 
phase  has  a  great  contribution  and  impact  to  establish 
usability  evaluation 
.Collections  of  guidelines  and 
standards are essential for design criteria of evaluation of 
usability. 

6.1.4  Evaluation  Based  on  Assessment  Model.  It  is  a 
theoretical model that specifies human-computer interface 
and human abilities in usability.  This model is considered 
as generic models of industry specific. 

6.2. Different types of Usability Evaluation Methods: 

Usability  Evaluation  methods can be  categorized in three 
types:  Testing, Inspection and Inquiry. 

6.2.1 Testing. Usability testing is a method that associated 
with user interaction and is used to evaluate a product by 
testing.  In this method a set of user are needed to perform 
task of the prototype of a product. Feedback from user helps 
to understand the evaluator about user interface. Testing 
methods include the following: [10], [13]. 

6.2.1.1 Thinking Aloud Protocol: Think aloud method is a 
technique to accumulate data that can be used in usability 
scenario.  In  this  method  user  verbally  announce  their 
thought of tasks. Generally an instructor gives instruction 
to  the  user  to  be  more  verbal  at  time  of  working.  In 
“Think-Aloud” protocol, 
the 
participants 
opportunities 
their  feelings  which  helps 
usability specialist to analyze the users experience. 

to  express 

have 

6.2.1.2  Rapid  Iterative  Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE 
Method):  Another  important  usability  method  is  Rapid 
Iterative Testing  and  Evaluation  (RITE)  method.  RITE  is 
an  iterative  method  of  usability  study.  The  tester  team 
focus  a  set  of  target  population  to  make  testing.  In  this 
method  particular  participant  is  chosen  for  a  task  on  a 
prototype  model  and  usability  engineer  based  on  their 
observation  collect  the  essential  data  for  the  participant. 
The  development  and  testing  team  decide  whether  there 
will  need  any  change  for  that  prototype  prior  to  the  next 
participant.  

6.2.1.3  Co-Discovery  Methods:  Co-discovery  method 
determines  that  usability  test  is  required  for  accumulate 
vital information from pairing of subjects. Discussion can 
help  to  find  out  the  problem  area  of  design  and 
documentation which is essential in usability study.  

6.2.1.4  Usability  Testing  Based  on  Component: 
Component-based  usability  testing is  used  for  interaction 
of component of a system and test the elementary unit of 
usability.  This  method  involves  quantitative  measure  of 
usability  which  is  based  on  user  interaction  by  interview 
and questionnaires. 

6.2.1.5  Benchmarking  Methods:  Benchmarking method 
determines the standard of design of the specific product. 
To establish a benchmark  four main  characteristics are to 
be  maintained  .i)Time  for  performing  the    task  ,ii)  time 

6.2.1.6  Coaching  Method:    In  this  technique  an  expert 
coach will  answer  the question of participants  best of his 
capability. Tester  observes  the  interaction  between  expert 
coach  and  user.  The  main  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
modify  the design of the product and make  it more  users 
friendly. 

in 

6.2.1.7  Remote  Testing:  Research  on  remote  usability 
evaluation  is  performed  with  the  user  and  the  evaluators 
located  in  separated  space  and  time.  Remote  testing  can 
be  divided 
two  categories  synchronous  and 
asynchronous.  Synchronous  usability  testing  is  related  to 
video  conferencing  or  employs  remote  application  that 
shares  the tools such as WebEx. And other one related to 
real  time  communication  between  the  evaluator  and 
participant user one to one. 

to 

6.2.1.8  Retrospective  Testing:  Sometimes  videotape  has 
been used for usability test session, and evaluator can able 
to  gather  information  by  reviewing  the  videotape  and 
make query to participants regarding their attitude during 
the  test.  The  main  requirement  for  this  technique  is  the 
user's  interaction  with  the  service  has  to  be  recorded  and 
replayed when necessary. 

6.2.1.9 Shadowing Method: In this method an expert user 
helps the tester during usability test .User performs in task 
domain  and  expert  user  explains 
the  attitude  and 
behaviour  of  normal  user  to  the  tester.  This  technique  is 
needed when tester are not able to communicate with user 
directly. 

6.2.2 Inspection. Usability inspection technique is mainly 
carried by usability specialists and software developers 
before usability test and this method helps the evaluator to 
resolve an issue related to usability. Some popular Inspection 
methods are: [10], [5]. 

6.2.2.1  Feature  Inspection:  Feature  inspection  technique 
concentrates  on  the  features  of  a  product.  In  this  method 
analysis  of  each  feature  is  needed  for  availability, 
understandability and functionality aspects of service. 

6.2.2.2 Perspective-based Inspection: Perspective-based 
inspections are used to broaden the problem-finding ability 
based on user perspectives. User can face different situations 
of interacting a new service or product [15].  

6.2.2.3  Pluralistic  walkthrough:  In  this  method  Experts 
and  specialists 
together  discuss  different  usability 
scenarios  and  try  to  find  optimizations  to  evaluate  a 
service or product [14].  

6.2.2.4  Cognitive  walkthrough:  Cognitive  walkthrough 
technique  is  used  to  detect  any  usability  problems  and 
make  the  service  easy  for  novice  user.  This  method  is 
under  usability  inspection  methods.  Experts  emulate  the 
user’s thoughts and concern when solving problems.    

6.2.3 Inquiry.The main objective of usability evaluators is 
to concern about user feedback. Users' facility, discomfort, 
necessity, and understand ability of a new system are very 

66 
 

European Journal of Academic Essays 1(3): 63-69, 2014 

important for evaluators. Observing the user attitude and 
discussing with them evaluator perform the task of 
evaluation. Inquiry methods comprise the following methods 
[10], [8], [16]. 

6.2.3.1  Field  Observation:  Evaluator  will  physically 
present  at  the  workplace  and  observe  the  task  of 
representative  user.  Evaluators  try  to  understand  how  the 
user deals with the system. 

6.2.3.2  Focus  Groups:  In  this  method,  a  group  of 
representative  user  are  selected  by  evaluators  to  collect 
data and find out the issues of the service. Evaluator plays 
the role of moderator, who prepares the list of issues from 
the  discussion  with  user. This  method  able to  capture  the 
spontaneous  user  reactions  that  evolves  in  the  process  of 
dynamic group. 

6.2.3.2  Interviews  and  Questionnaires  [13]:  In  this 
method,  evaluator  prepares  a  set  of  questions  about  the 
product  and  they  interview  to  the  users  from  these 
questions in order to gather information. In an evaluation 
interview  technique,  user  answers  the  question  verbally, 
and the interviewer records those responses. There are two 
types of interview:  unstructured interview and structured 
interview. 

  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Structured  interviewing:  In  this  method  there  are  a 
predetermined  and  specific  agenda  and  a  set  of 
specific  questions  are  prepared,  a  guidelines  are 
maintained when interrogation going on. There are two 
types of Questionnaire methods. 

  Pre-test  Questionnaire:  Pre-test  questionnaire  requires 
various  attribute  to  perform  the  test,  such  as  first 
impressions of user about a product, user information.  

  Post-test Questionnaire.  This  process  is done after the 
completion  of  the  task  successfully.  User  provides 
their  opinions  and  feelings  of  that  service  after 
completing their works 

7. Cloud Usability Metrics 

There are some metrics which are based on statistical and   
countable 
information.  Countable  metrics  can  be 
constructed from raw data that are collected from various 
log,  video  recording,  interview  and  questionnaires.  We 
will  discuss  10  metrics  which  are  used  for  usability 
evaluation [5], [8], [6], [17]. 
  Unstructured  interviewing:  In  this  method  interviewer 
is  not  concerned  with  the  specification  of  systems. 
They  ask  the  question  to  user  to  collect  information 
based on their experience. 

  Completion Rates:  Completion rate can be considered 
as  a  basic  usability  metric.  It  can  be  determined  as 
gateway metric also. It can be represented as a binary 
metric (1 can be considered as Success of task and 0 is 
treated as failure of task.) 

  Usability Problems: It is considered as a key metric for 
measuring usability activity. This focuses the problem 

which is done by user while using the cloud service or 
web service. It also describes severity ratings of those 
problems. 

  Task  Time:  It  is  one  of  the  important  key  metric  that 
can be used to measure the efficiency and productivity 
of cloud and web service. Total task time defines how 
long  a  user  takes  to  complete  a  task. Task  time  is  the 
duration between a Start task times and end task time. 

  Task  Level  Satisfaction:  When  user  completes  a  task 
his  or  her  feedback  is  essential  to  determine  the 
satisfaction and difficulty level of tasks. 

  Test  Level  Satisfaction:  An 

is 

interview 

to  be 
conducted  with  users  at  the  end  of  usability  test  and 
from the feedback of the user, tester determine the ease 
of usability.  System Usability Scale (SUS) is required 
for  testing  of  software,  hardware  and  devices  .The 
SUS  is  technology  independent  and is  very  simple 
which  provides  global  view  of subjective  assessments 
of usability. 

  Errors: Error  may  be  encountered  by  user  by  doing 
wrong action, omission and mistakes while performing 
a job. Description of error along with each instance is 
recorded  which  is  helpful  in  Usability  Inspection 
problems. 

  User Expectation: It is based on the expectation of user 
about  the  difficulty  level  of  a  task  .A  comparison  is 
done  between  the  expectation  of  user  about  difficulty 
of  task  and  actual  difficulty  of  task.  (Experiment 
conducted on set of user). 

  Page  Views/Clicks:   This  metric  is  specially  needed 
for  web-applications  and  cloud  application.  Only  this 
fundamental metrics user can able to access.  Clicks or 
page view determines  success  rate or failure of a task 
.This  metrics  is  used  for  better  measurement  of 
efficiency of web or cloud service. 
  Conversion:  Conversion  metric 

the 
measurement  of  the  effectiveness  of  a  product.  It  is 
essential  metric  used  in  e-Commerce.  Usability  of 
conversion  rates  is  used  in  all  phases  of  the  sales 
process  by  focusing  on  the  usability  problems,  errors 
and reduces time. 

is  used  for 

of 

efficiency, 

  Single  Usability  Metric  (SUM):  This  metric  is  the 
combination of four usability metrics respectively  task 
completion  rate,  average  number  of  errors,  average 
time on task and post-task satisfaction .  This metrics is 
summation 
and 
satisfaction. 
Standard  Units  of  Measure  (SUoM)  is  metric  is 
particularly  used 
for  cloud  evaluation.  Service 
provider  and  vendors  provide  cloud  metric  that 
relevant  to  business  needs.  To  manage  the  cloud 
services  following  metrics  are  to  be  considered  [13], 
[6], and [18]. 

effectiveness 

  Costing  of  Cloud  percentage  of  Revenue:  It  describes 
the costing price of cloud that is related to revenue of 
business. 

  Cloud  Cost 

based 

on  Application/Business 
perspectives: The main aim of this metric to maximize 
business  profit  at  low  cost.   Cloud  Cost  related  to  per 
Transaction of business infrastructure.

  DiskRead time: This metric is required to identify the 

rate at which the application reads a disk. 

  DiskWrite time: This metric is required to identify the 

rate at which the application writes to a disk. 

  Average    Load  Time:  It  considered    the  load  time  to 

upload video and image 

  File CRUD Times: The time required to Create, Read, 

and Update or Delete a file of fixed size.  

  Database  CRUD  Times:  Average  time  required  to 
execute the commands to create, read, update or delete 
file from desired cloud database.  

  Average  &  Peak  CPU  Utilization:  It  is  a  crucial 
matrices which depends on how much percentage CPU 
is      computed  in  cloud  environment  and  how  many 
instance is currently running. 

  CPU Performance Variance: It defines the consistency 
level of CPU performance and also defines how cloud 
virtualization is responsible for CPU cycles. 

  Network-In:  This  metrics  identifies  number  of  bytes 

received in all network interfaces by the instance. 

  Network-Out: This  metrics  identifies  number  of  bytes 

sent in all network interfaces by the instance. 

8. Conclusion 

Today the World Wide Web gain huge popularity because of 
various  services  provided  to  the  user  in  the  field  of  cloud 
computing  and  human  computer  interface.  Thus,  usability 
becomes  a  vital  attribute  for  measuring  user  satisfaction 
level,  which  may  further  improve  the  performance  and 
effectiveness  of  software  product  as  well  as  web  cloud. 
Usability  can  be  considered  as  an  attribute  to  measure  the 
intelligence  of  Cloud  while  performing  the  task  in  order  to 
achieve  the  user’s  goal  and  needs.  In  this  paper  we 
summarize  usability  evaluation  techniques,  assessment  and 
issue  related  to  cloud  computing  services.  The  users' 
performance  in  the  cloud  environment  can  improve  the 
quality  of  cloud  service  .The  user  performance  in  the  cloud 
environment  can  improve  the  quality  of  the  cloud  service 
which leads to increase in ROI and user satisfaction level.
