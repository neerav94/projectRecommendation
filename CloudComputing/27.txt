Cloud Computing offers SaaS, PaaS, and 
IaaS as cost effective ways of doing 
computation. The recent rapid deployment 
of Cloud Computing comes with a cost that 
can leave users open to vulnerabilities such 
as: Disruptions that may shutdown 24x7 
computation availability of essential services 
since the concentration of government and 
or multiple businesses resources at a single 
site is a convenient target for effective 
cyber-terrorist attacks; Possible theft of 
Cloud resident software Intellectual Property 
and confidential Personal Information; and 
the unwarranted invasions of user data 
privacy. While this mini-track cannot 
adequately cover all of the issues with 
respect to “Secure Cloud Computing,” the 
following six papers open for discussion 
several significant issues in this area.

The first paper, “Analysis of Monolithic and 
Microkernel  Architectures:  Towards  Secure 
Hypervisor  Design,”  by  Jordan  Shropshire 
of  Georgia  Southern  University,  focuses  on 
hypervisor 
the 
vulnerability of its subsystems.

Dependency 
digraphs: The Case of Cloud Data Services,” 
by Katerina Stamou, et al., of the University 
of  Geneva,  and  Michael  Georgio  of  the 
University of Cyprus, addresses the issue of 
SLA data management.

Framework for Storage and Computation on 
Enterprise  Data  in  the  Cloud,”  by  Sourya 
Joyee  De  and  Asim  K.  Pal,  of  the  Indian 
Institute  of  Management  Calcutta,  West 
Bengal, 
for 
establishing trust with an outsourced CSP. 
 
The  forth  paper,  “Securing  KVM-based 
Cloud 
Virtualization 
Introspection,” by Sheng-Wei Lee, and Fang 
Yu of National Chengchi University, Taipei, 
Taiwan,  and  Ken  Tang  of  National  Chiao 
Tung  University,  HsinChu,  Taiwan, 
proposes  a  new  virtualization  introspection 
system  to  protect  the  hosts  as  well  as  VMs 
on  a  KVN-based  cloud  structure  from 
malicious attacks. 
 
The  fifth  paper,  “A  Taxonomic  Perspective 
on Certification Schemes: Development of a 
Taxonomy  for  Cloud  Service  Certification 
(CSC) Criteria,” by Stephan Schneider, Jens 
Lansing,  Fangjian  Gao,  and  Ali  Suyaev  of 
the  University  of  Cologne,  delineates  the 
results  of  expert  interviews  in  a  taxonomy 
that  can  be  used  in  future  research  to 
improve CSC’s.  
 
The  sixth  paper,  “Cloud  Computing  Data 
Protection,  A 
and 
Analysis,” by Florian Pfaff, Thomas Buckel 
and  Axel  Winkelmann  of  the  University  of 
Wuerzburg, aims to provide an overview of 
privacy issues and legal frameworks for data 
protection  in  Cloud  environments  discussed 
in recent scientific literature.
