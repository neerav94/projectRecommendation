THEORETICAL BASELINE 

Cloud  Computing  is  not  only  simple  collection  of  resource,  but  also  provider  a  management

A.    Types of Service Models in Cloud  
                      
 Cloud computing providers offer their services according to three fundamental models: 
  
(1).SaaS (Software as a Service):-the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s 
application on a cloud infrastructure [4]  
 

(2)PaaS (platform as a service):- The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the 

cloud infrastructure consumer-created [4].

application  in  the  same  development  environment  .The  application  layer  is  the  highest  layer  a 
feature a complete application offered as service.[11] 
  
 
B. Types of Cloud:- 

Private cloud: - 

The cloud infrastructure is exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers 

(e.g. business units).  

 

Public cloud: - 

The cloud infrastructure  is open use by the general public.  It may be self, or managed by third 

party. 

 

Community cloud:  

The  cloud  infrastructure  is  use  by  a  specific  community  of  consumers  from  organizations  that 

have shared any type of concerns. It may be self, managed, and operated by single or more than 

one organization in the community, a third party, or any combination of them, and exist on or off 

premises.  

 

Hybrid cloud:  

Hybrid cloud infrastructure is a combination of two or more different cloud  

 

Infrastructures: 

               The relevant  problem associate  with  cloud computing is  the data cloud  security, there 

are  different  factor  are  effect  on  data  security  like  data  dynamics  integrity  of  data,  and  data 

privacy affects. 

              There  are  many  approaches  and  algorithm  are  given  for  data  security  of  cloud 

computing.  Each  and  every  approaches  and  algorithm  has  advantage  and  disadvantage  which 

make  them  suitable  for  distinct    Services.  Within  the  cloud  computing  world,  the  virtual 

environment  lets  users’  access  computing  power  that  exceeds  that  contained  within  their  own

data  nor  the  other  sources  of  the  data  collectively  stored  with  theirs.  To  ensure  data 

confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), the storage provider must offer capabilities that, 

at a minimum, include 

  a tested encryption schema to ensure that the shared storage environment safeguards all 

data; 

  stringent access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the data; and 

  Scheduled data backup and safe storage of the backup media.

Scope of the study 

Cloud  computing  users  range  from  individuals  and  small  businesses  to  Fortune  800 
firms  and      governments.  According  to  a  September  2008  survey  from  the  Pew 
Research Institute, nearly 69 percent of Americans use cloud computing services (such 
as webmail and online data backup sites). In India, companies such as Ashok Leyland, 
Tata Elxi, Bharti, Infosys, Asian Paints, many Universityes  and Maruti are either piloting 
or  using  cloud  computing.  Additionally,  nearly  1,500  companies  in  India  already  use 
blended  (voice-chat-data)  cloud-based  communication  services  from  vendors  such  as 
Cisco WebEx and Microsoft.The US government projects  that between 2010 and 2015, 
its  spending  on  cloud  computing  will  be  at  approximately  a  40-percent  compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) and will pass $7 billion by 2015 

  Cloud  computing  is  nothing  it  is  a  data  centre  environment  allows  enterprises  to  get 
their applications up and running faster, with easier manageability and lessmaintenance 
to  meet  business  demands.    The  smart  phones  we  are  seeing  in  the  world  today  use

THEORETICAL BASELINE 

Cloud  Computing  is  not  only  simple  collection  of  resource,  but  also  provider  a  management 
mechanism  and  provide  service  for  millions  of  user  simultaneously.  Cloud  computing  broke

A.    Types of Service Models in Cloud  
                      
 Cloud computing providers offer their services according to three fundamental models: 
  
(1).SaaS (Software as a Service):-the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s 
application on a cloud infrastructure [4]  
 

(2)PaaS (platform as a service):- The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the 

cloud infrastructure consumer-created [4].

application  in  the  same  development  environment  .The  application  layer  is  the  highest  layer  a 
feature a complete application offered as service.[11] 
  
 
B. Types of Cloud:- 

Private cloud: - 

The cloud infrastructure is exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers 

(e.g. business units).  

 

Public cloud: - 

The cloud infrastructure  is open use by the general public.  It may be self, or managed by third 

party. 

 

Community cloud:  

The  cloud  infrastructure  is  use  by  a  specific  community  of  consumers  from  organizations  that 

have shared any type of concerns. It may be self, managed, and operated by single or more than 

one organization in the community, a third party, or any combination of them, and exist on or off 

premises.  

 

Hybrid cloud:  

Hybrid cloud infrastructure is a combination of two or more different cloud  

 

Infrastructures: 

               The relevant  problem associate  with  cloud computing is  the data cloud  security, there 

are  different  factor  are  effect  on  data  security  like  data  dynamics  integrity  of  data,  and  data

              There  are  many  approaches  and  algorithm  are  given  for  data  security  of  cloud 

computing.  Each  and  every  approaches  and  algorithm  has  advantage  and  disadvantage  which 

make  them  suitable  for  distinct    Services.  Within  the  cloud  computing  world,  the  virtual

data  nor  the  other  sources  of  the  data  collectively  stored  with  theirs.  To  ensure  data 

confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), the storage provider must offer capabilities that, 

at a minimum, include 

  a tested encryption schema to ensure that the shared storage environment safeguards all 

data; 

  stringent access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the data; and 

  Scheduled data backup and safe storage of the backup media.

Review of the Cloud Security  literature 

There  are  so  many  approaches  and  methods  are  carried  out    for  over  come  on  that 

issues  of  cloud  computing  .these  approaches  has  merits  and  demerits  that  are  vary

Are  the  ubiauity  off  broad  brand  and  wireless  network  .  in  a  cloud  computing  a  single 

software  installation  can  cover  many  user  needs.  Within  cloud    the  law  of  portability

man agreements. Author Loan Raiou and  shiyong said that “ the cloud security modal 

adopted by grid [12] . Some of them are given below :- 

 

The author  Abhishek Mohta and R. Sahu   have given algorithm which ensures data 

integrity and dynamic data operations.  

(1) encryption                                    (2)  message digest 

 encryption ensures that data is not leaked while transfer. It Provide security for       data 

and  message  digest  gives  identity  of  client  who  has  send  data.  They  have  designed 

algorithm  for  data  manipulation,  insertion  of  record  and  record  deletion.  Insertion  and 

manipulation algorithms inserts and manipulate data efficiently 

Drawback  :-  Main  drawback  of  this    algorithm  ,in  situation  of    data  deletion  we  cant 

identify the person who have deleted record, how and when means if any one deletes 

record then this algorithm can no longer work.[1] 

The author  Ateniese et al.  are the first who have considered the public adaptability in 

their  defined―provable  data  possession  (PDP)  method.which  ensures  possession  of 

data  files  on  untrusted  storages.  For  auditing  outsourced  data  their  technique  utilizes 

the RSA-based homomorphism authenticators and suggests to randomly sample a few 

blocks  of  the  file.  However,  in  their  scheme  the  public  auditability  demands  the  linear 

combination of sampled blocks which exposed to the external auditor.  

Drawback  :-When used  directly,  their  protocol  is  not provably  privacy  preserving,  and 

thus may leak user data information to the auditor[1]

ensuring  the  remote  data  integrity.  In  that  some  additional  bits  are  add  with  data 

information  .  through  this  we  can  check  data  information  any  where    for  security

 Shacham  et  al.  built  on  this  model  and  constructed  a  random  linear  function

and requires less communication overhead.[1] 

 

Scope of the study 

Cloud  computing  users  range  from  individuals  and  small  businesses  to  Fortune  800 
firms  and      governments.  According  to  a  September  2008  survey  from  the  Pew 
Research Institute, nearly 69 percent of Americans use cloud computing services (such 
as webmail and online data backup sites). In India, companies such as Ashok Leyland, 
Tata Elxi, Bharti, Infosys, Asian Paints, many Universityes  and Maruti are either piloting 
or  using  cloud  computing.  Additionally,  nearly  1,500  companies  in  India  already  use 
blended  (voice-chat-data)  cloud-based  communication  services  from  vendors  such  as 
Cisco WebEx and Microsoft.The US government projects  that between 2010 and 2015, 
its  spending  on  cloud  computing  will  be  at  approximately  a  40-percent  compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) and will pass $7 billion by 2015 

  Cloud  computing  is  nothing  it  is  a  data  centre  environment  allows  enterprises  to  get 
their applications up and running faster, with easier manageability and lessmaintenance 
to  meet  business  demands.    The  smart  phones  we  are  seeing  in  the  world  today  use

their  internal  memory  likewise  the  phones  coming  nowadays  are  having  their  storage 
capacities  like  16gb  to  32gb,  etc.  so  it  is  seen  that  the  memory  is  required  on  each 
mobile phone device to save applications and files of its users and it is also seen that 
main cost for a mobile phonen So instead if you use cloud computing here which means 
the  device  with  you  will  be  just  for  communication  or  interaction  between  you  and  the 
server  and  all  your  apps  and  data  is  stored  at  some  other  location  so  its  reduces  the 
cost of that smart phones. 

 

Limitations of the study 

In  spite  of  security  advantages,  cloud  computing  paradigm  also  introduces  some  key 
security challenges. Here we discuss some of these key security challenges 

.  How  do  we  effectively  manage  the  virtual  machine  (VM)  life  cycle  to  deliver  quality 
expectations  of  consumers  and  at  the  same  time  reduce  the  cost  delivery  of 
services?[13] 

. Data Location: In general, cloud users are not aware of the exact location Of the data 
center and also they do not have any control  over the physical access  mechanisms to 
that data. Most well-known cloud service providers have datacenters around the globe. 
Some  service  providers  also  take  advantage  of  their  global  datacenters.  However,  in 
some  cases  applications  and  data  might  be  stored  in  countries,  which  can  judiciary 
concerns. For example, if the user data is stored in X country then service providers will 
be subjected to the security requirements and legal obligations of X country. This may 
also happen that user does not have the information of these issues. 

.How  do  we  secure  the  data  and  computation  on  the  VMs  managed  by  Cloud  service 
providers? [13] . 

.Investigation:  Investigating  an  illegitimate  activity  may  be  impossible  in  cloud  
environments.  Cloud  services  are  especially  hard  to  investigate,  because  data  for 
multiple customers may be co-located and may also be spread across multiple 

. How do we guarantee users’ privacy and trust requirements? [13] . 

.Recovery:  Cloud  service  providers  must  ensure  the  data  security  in  natural  and man-
made disasters. Generally, data is replicated across multiple sites. However, in the case 
of any such unwanted event, provider must do a complete and quick restoration. 

How  do  we  manage  Service  Level  Agreements  (SLAs)  and  how  do  we  guarantee 
quality of service (QoS) satisfaction and prevent or minimize SLA violations?[13]

 encryption ensures that data is not leaked while transfer. It Provide security for       data 

and  message  digest  gives  identity  of  client  who  has  send  data.  They  have  designed 

algorithm  for  data  manipulation,  insertion  of  record  and  record  deletion.  Insertion  and 

manipulation algorithms inserts and manipulate data efficiently 

Drawback  :-  Main  drawback  of  this    algorithm  ,in  situation  of    data  deletion  we  cant 

identify the person who have deleted record, how and when means if any one deletes 

record then this algorithm can no longer work.[1] 

The author  Ateniese et al.  are the first who have considered the public adaptability in 

their  defined―provable  data  possession  (PDP)  method.which  ensures  possession  of 

data  files  on  untrusted  storages.  For  auditing  outsourced  data  their  technique  utilizes 

the RSA-based homomorphism authenticators and suggests to randomly sample a few 

blocks  of  the  file.  However,  in  their  scheme  the  public  auditability  demands  the  linear 

combination of sampled blocks which exposed to the external auditor.  

Drawback  :-When used  directly,  their  protocol  is  not provably  privacy  preserving,  and 

thus may leak user data information to the auditor[1]

The  author  Juels  et  al.described  a  formal  “proof  of  retrievability”  (POR)  model  for 

ensuring  the  remote  data  integrity.  In  that  some  additional  bits  are  add  with  data 

information  .  through  this  we  can  check  data  information  any  where    for  security 

purpose  that  is  called  spot  checking  .If  any  problem  come  we  correct  the  information 

according  to additional which were add as a header with information that called  Error 

correcting. These two phenomena  provide possession and retrievability of information 

of file on archieve service system.[1]

Scope of the study 

Cloud  computing  users  range  from  individuals  and  small  businesses  to  Fortune  800 
firms  and      governments.  According  to  a  September  2008  survey  from  the  Pew 
Research Institute, nearly 69 percent of Americans use cloud computing services (such 
as webmail and online data backup sites). In India, companies such as Ashok Leyland, 
Tata Elxi, Bharti, Infosys, Asian Paints, many Universityes  and Maruti are either piloting 
or  using  cloud  computing.  Additionally,  nearly  1,500  companies  in  India  already  use 
blended  (voice-chat-data)  cloud-based  communication  services  from  vendors  such  as 
Cisco WebEx and Microsoft.The US government projects  that between 2010 and 2015, 
its  spending  on  cloud  computing  will  be  at  approximately  a  40-percent  compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) and will pass $7 billion by 2015 

  Cloud  computing  is  nothing  it  is  a  data  centre  environment  allows  enterprises  to  get 
their applications up and running faster, with easier manageability and lessmaintenance 
to  meet  business  demands.    The  smart  phones  we  are  seeing  in  the  world  today  use

their  internal  memory  likewise  the  phones  coming  nowadays  are  having  their  storage 
capacities  like  16gb  to  32gb,  etc.  so  it  is  seen  that  the  memory  is  required  on  each 
mobile phone device to save applications and files of its users and it is also seen that 
main cost for a mobile phonen So instead if you use cloud computing here which means 
the  device  with  you  will  be  just  for  communication  or  interaction  between  you  and  the 
server  and  all  your  apps  and  data  is  stored  at  some  other  location  so  its  reduces  the 
cost of that smart phones. 

 

Limitations of the study 

In  spite  of  security  advantages,  cloud  computing  paradigm  also  introduces  some  key 
security challenges. Here we discuss some of these key security challenges 

.  How  do  we  effectively  manage  the  virtual  machine  (VM)  life  cycle  to  deliver  quality 
expectations  of  consumers  and  at  the  same  time  reduce  the  cost  delivery  of 
services?[13] 

. Data Location: In general, cloud users are not aware of the exact location Of the data 
center and also they do not have any control  over the physical access  mechanisms to 
that data. Most well-known cloud service providers have datacenters around the globe. 
Some  service  providers  also  take  advantage  of  their  global  datacenters.  However,  in 
some  cases  applications  and  data  might  be  stored  in  countries,  which  can  judiciary 
concerns. For example, if the user data is stored in X country then service providers will 
be subjected to the security requirements and legal obligations of X country. This may 
also happen that user does not have the information of these issues. 

.How  do  we  secure  the  data  and  computation  on  the  VMs  managed  by  Cloud  service 
providers? [13] . 

.Investigation:  Investigating  an  illegitimate  activity  may  be  impossible  in  cloud  
environments.  Cloud  services  are  especially  hard  to  investigate,  because  data  for 
multiple customers may be co-located and may also be spread across multiple 

. How do we guarantee users’ privacy and trust requirements? [13] . 

.Recovery:  Cloud  service  providers  must  ensure  the  data  security  in  natural  and man-
made disasters. Generally, data is replicated across multiple sites. However, in the case 
of any such unwanted event, provider must do a complete and quick restoration. 

How  do  we  manage  Service  Level  Agreements  (SLAs)  and  how  do  we  guarantee 
quality of service (QoS) satisfaction and prevent or minimize SLA violations?[13]

Cloud  interoperability  :-  customer  ability  to  use  same  artifacts  ,  such  as  management 
tools , virtual server and image and so on with verity of cloud providers and plateform.  

What  standards  and  interfaces  are  needed  for  portability  and  scalability  of  application 
services?[13] 

 

.Software / hardware architecture , data management , security and privacy and service  
provisioning  and    SLA  (  Service  level  agreement  )  are  main  key  limitation  of  cloud 
computing .
