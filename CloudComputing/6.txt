Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1).

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices.

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3).

BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

1. Introduction 

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

1. Introduction 

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the related 
work of this paper. This section describes the situation of cloud based multimedia streaming 
service  and  the  previous  related  work.  Section  3,  which  is  the  core  part  of  this  paper,  gets 
under  way  of  model  building.  It  includes  three  steps:  first  find  out  the  new  requirement  in 
multimedia streaming service, then explore the association between the new requirement and 
the  initial  BMIS  model,  finally  mapping  the  leverage  point  to  new  requirement  for  model 
implementation. Section 4 makes the conclusions of this paper, describes the advantage and 
meaning of the whole work, also point out the shortcomings of this paper. 
 
2. Related work. 
 
2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process.

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

management  mode  to  optimize  the  resource  of  cloud  related  enterprise.  Cloud  based

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process.

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 
 

Figure 4. Cloud applied leveraged BMIS model [9] 

 

 

The  proposed  risk  management  model  supplies  an  integrated  risk  control  function  to 
general  cloud  service.  Although  the  basis  risk  control  for  cloud  broadcast  service  should 
comply  with  the  general  cloud  risk  control,  direct  using  of  this  model  to  the  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service area will be somewhat thoughtless. Through above analysis, we 
found the new requirement in cloud broadcast environment: the performance  requirement is 
requisite for risk management in cloud multimedia streaming service. To apply this leveraged 
BMIS  model  to  this  area, we  need  to  find  out the  connection  between  the  new requirement 
and the proposed cloud applied BMIS model. 

As mentioned above, performance requirement refers to three aspects. 
First, the UI aspect, it can involve technology and people elements in initial BMIS model. 
For technology element, it needs a “UI design” technique support. This factor do not exist in 
original leveraged BMIS model, it’s a new factor which we need to take into consideration in 
broadcast environment. For people element, it relates to “human resource” factor. 

Second, the UX aspect, it can connect with process element.  For detail level, it relates to 

the specific factor “feedback loops”  

Third, the SLA requirement, it can connect with organization element.  For detail level, it 

relates to the specific factor “contract (SLA)”. 

Thus  the  performance  requirement  involves  all  elements  existed  in  BMIS  model. 
Organization, people, process and technology, each element  holds a causal factor which can 
correspond with the performance requirement. The new relationship built as follows. (Figure 
5 below)

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices.

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

management  mode  to  optimize  the  resource  of  cloud  related  enterprise.  Cloud  based 
streaming service, as one kind of cloud service can also under administration of this model.

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process.

3.1.  New  requirement  exploration 
management 

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 
 

Figure 4. Cloud applied leveraged BMIS model [9] 

 

 

The  proposed  risk  management  model  supplies  an  integrated  risk  control  function  to 
general  cloud  service.  Although  the  basis  risk  control  for  cloud  broadcast  service  should 
comply  with  the  general  cloud  risk  control,  direct  using  of  this  model  to  the  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service area will be somewhat thoughtless. Through above analysis, we 
found the new requirement in cloud broadcast environment: the performance  requirement is 
requisite for risk management in cloud multimedia streaming service. To apply this leveraged 
BMIS  model  to  this  area, we  need  to  find  out the  connection  between  the  new requirement 
and the proposed cloud applied BMIS model. 

As mentioned above, performance requirement refers to three aspects. 
First, the UI aspect, it can involve technology and people elements in initial BMIS model. 
For technology element, it needs a “UI design” technique support. This factor do not exist in 
original leveraged BMIS model, it’s a new factor which we need to take into consideration in 
broadcast environment. For people element, it relates to “human resource” factor. 

Second, the UX aspect, it can connect with process element.  For detail level, it relates to 

the specific factor “feedback loops”  

Third, the SLA requirement, it can connect with organization element.  For detail level, it 

relates to the specific factor “contract (SLA)”. 

Thus  the  performance  requirement  involves  all  elements  existed  in  BMIS  model. 
Organization, people, process and technology, each element  holds a causal factor which can 
correspond with the performance requirement. The new relationship built as follows. (Figure 
5 below)

Figure  5  illustrates  the  performance  connection  with  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  the 
innermost foursquare represents the specific risk causal factors which under control of certain 
element;  the  intermediate  circle  represents  the  overlap  factors  which  correspond  with  the 
performance requirement; the  outermost foursquare on behalf of the four elements which in 
charge of all cloud risk causal factors. 

From the figure, it’s easy to see that the performance definitely not an individual factor but 
a connector for the holistic system. It’s worth noting that, performance here is a requirement 
which  can  associate  all  elements  in  BMIS  model;  it  also  can  be  seen  as  one  of  risk 
management  target  (although  the  ultimate  target  is  for  business  benefit  and  continuity)  in 
cloud multimedia streaming service environment. 
 
3.3. Cloud multimedia streaming service applied leveraged BMIS model  

Since performance as a new target and requirement added into the BMIS model for cloud 
multimedia  streaming  risk  management,  we  aim  to  find  the  new  item’s  leverage  point  for 
enhancing the effectiveness of this model.  

 In order to mapping performance with leverage point, first we need a better understanding 
of  the  meaning  of  every  leverage  point.  We  read  the  “twelve  leverage  points”  in-depth  and 
conclude the key conception of every leverage point as below. (See Table 3) 

According  to  the  concept  description  of  performance  requirement  and  the  keyword 
description  of  each  leverage  point,  performance  is  more  close  to  leverage  point  3.  That’s 
because  performance  as  a  risk  management  target  and  a  connecter  of  all  model  elements 
(involves the physical maintenance, feedback loops etc.) helps to improve the service quality 
and  ensure  the  customer  retention.  This  right  matches  with  leverage  point  3  which  also 
mentioned a system goal and increase of market share.

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

1. Introduction 

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the related 
work of this paper. This section describes the situation of cloud based multimedia streaming 
service  and  the  previous  related  work.  Section  3,  which  is  the  core  part  of  this  paper,  gets 
under  way  of  model  building.  It  includes  three  steps:  first  find  out  the  new  requirement  in 
multimedia streaming service, then explore the association between the new requirement and 
the  initial  BMIS  model,  finally  mapping  the  leverage  point  to  new  requirement  for  model 
implementation. Section 4 makes the conclusions of this paper, describes the advantage and 
meaning of the whole work, also point out the shortcomings of this paper. 
 
2. Related work. 
 
2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

management  mode  to  optimize  the  resource  of  cloud  related  enterprise.  Cloud  based 
streaming service, as one kind of cloud service can also under administration of this model.

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process.

3.1.  New  requirement  exploration 
management 

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Figure 4. Cloud applied leveraged BMIS model [9] 

 

 

The  proposed  risk  management  model  supplies  an  integrated  risk  control  function  to 
general  cloud  service.  Although  the  basis  risk  control  for  cloud  broadcast  service  should 
comply  with  the  general  cloud  risk  control,  direct  using  of  this  model  to  the  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service area will be somewhat thoughtless. Through above analysis, we 
found the new requirement in cloud broadcast environment: the performance  requirement is 
requisite for risk management in cloud multimedia streaming service. To apply this leveraged 
BMIS  model  to  this  area, we  need  to  find  out the  connection  between  the  new requirement 
and the proposed cloud applied BMIS model. 

As mentioned above, performance requirement refers to three aspects. 
First, the UI aspect, it can involve technology and people elements in initial BMIS model. 
For technology element, it needs a “UI design” technique support. This factor do not exist in 
original leveraged BMIS model, it’s a new factor which we need to take into consideration in 
broadcast environment. For people element, it relates to “human resource” factor. 

Second, the UX aspect, it can connect with process element.  For detail level, it relates to 

the specific factor “feedback loops”  

Third, the SLA requirement, it can connect with organization element.  For detail level, it 

relates to the specific factor “contract (SLA)”. 

Thus  the  performance  requirement  involves  all  elements  existed  in  BMIS  model. 
Organization, people, process and technology, each element  holds a causal factor which can 
correspond with the performance requirement. The new relationship built as follows. (Figure 
5 below)

Figure  5  illustrates  the  performance  connection  with  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  the 
innermost foursquare represents the specific risk causal factors which under control of certain 
element;  the  intermediate  circle  represents  the  overlap  factors  which  correspond  with  the 
performance requirement; the  outermost foursquare on behalf of the four elements which in 
charge of all cloud risk causal factors. 

From the figure, it’s easy to see that the performance definitely not an individual factor but 
a connector for the holistic system. It’s worth noting that, performance here is a requirement 
which  can  associate  all  elements  in  BMIS  model;  it  also  can  be  seen  as  one  of  risk 
management  target  (although  the  ultimate  target  is  for  business  benefit  and  continuity)  in 
cloud multimedia streaming service environment. 
 
3.3. Cloud multimedia streaming service applied leveraged BMIS model  

Since performance as a new target and requirement added into the BMIS model for cloud 
multimedia  streaming  risk  management,  we  aim  to  find  the  new  item’s  leverage  point  for 
enhancing the effectiveness of this model.  

 In order to mapping performance with leverage point, first we need a better understanding 
of  the  meaning  of  every  leverage  point.  We  read  the  “twelve  leverage  points”  in-depth  and 
conclude the key conception of every leverage point as below. (See Table 3) 

According  to  the  concept  description  of  performance  requirement  and  the  keyword 
description  of  each  leverage  point,  performance  is  more  close  to  leverage  point  3.  That’s 
because  performance  as  a  risk  management  target  and  a  connecter  of  all  model  elements 
(involves the physical maintenance, feedback loops etc.) helps to improve the service quality 
and  ensure  the  customer  retention.  This  right  matches  with  leverage  point  3  which  also 
mentioned a system goal and increase of market share.

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

1. Introduction 

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the related 
work of this paper. This section describes the situation of cloud based multimedia streaming 
service  and  the  previous  related  work.  Section  3,  which  is  the  core  part  of  this  paper,  gets 
under  way  of  model  building.  It  includes  three  steps:  first  find  out  the  new  requirement  in 
multimedia streaming service, then explore the association between the new requirement and 
the  initial  BMIS  model,  finally  mapping  the  leverage  point  to  new  requirement  for  model 
implementation. Section 4 makes the conclusions of this paper, describes the advantage and 
meaning of the whole work, also point out the shortcomings of this paper. 
 
2. Related work. 
 
2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

management  mode  to  optimize  the  resource  of  cloud  related  enterprise.  Cloud  based 
streaming service, as one kind of cloud service can also under administration of this model.

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process.

3.1.  New  requirement  exploration 
management 

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Figure 4. Cloud applied leveraged BMIS model [9] 

 

 

The  proposed  risk  management  model  supplies  an  integrated  risk  control  function  to 
general  cloud  service.  Although  the  basis  risk  control  for  cloud  broadcast  service  should 
comply  with  the  general  cloud  risk  control,  direct  using  of  this  model  to  the  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service area will be somewhat thoughtless. Through above analysis, we 
found the new requirement in cloud broadcast environment: the performance  requirement is 
requisite for risk management in cloud multimedia streaming service. To apply this leveraged 
BMIS  model  to  this  area, we  need  to  find  out the  connection  between  the  new requirement 
and the proposed cloud applied BMIS model. 

As mentioned above, performance requirement refers to three aspects. 
First, the UI aspect, it can involve technology and people elements in initial BMIS model. 
For technology element, it needs a “UI design” technique support. This factor do not exist in 
original leveraged BMIS model, it’s a new factor which we need to take into consideration in 
broadcast environment. For people element, it relates to “human resource” factor. 

Second, the UX aspect, it can connect with process element.  For detail level, it relates to 

the specific factor “feedback loops”  

Third, the SLA requirement, it can connect with organization element.  For detail level, it 

relates to the specific factor “contract (SLA)”. 

Thus  the  performance  requirement  involves  all  elements  existed  in  BMIS  model. 
Organization, people, process and technology, each element  holds a causal factor which can 
correspond with the performance requirement. The new relationship built as follows. (Figure 
5 below)

Figure  5  illustrates  the  performance  connection  with  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  the 
innermost foursquare represents the specific risk causal factors which under control of certain 
element;  the  intermediate  circle  represents  the  overlap  factors  which  correspond  with  the 
performance requirement; the  outermost foursquare on behalf of the four elements which in 
charge of all cloud risk causal factors. 

From the figure, it’s easy to see that the performance definitely not an individual factor but 
a connector for the holistic system. It’s worth noting that, performance here is a requirement 
which  can  associate  all  elements  in  BMIS  model;  it  also  can  be  seen  as  one  of  risk 
management  target  (although  the  ultimate  target  is  for  business  benefit  and  continuity)  in 
cloud multimedia streaming service environment. 
 
3.3. Cloud multimedia streaming service applied leveraged BMIS model  

Since performance as a new target and requirement added into the BMIS model for cloud 
multimedia  streaming  risk  management,  we  aim  to  find  the  new  item’s  leverage  point  for 
enhancing the effectiveness of this model.  

 In order to mapping performance with leverage point, first we need a better understanding 
of  the  meaning  of  every  leverage  point.  We  read  the  “twelve  leverage  points”  in-depth  and 
conclude the key conception of every leverage point as below. (See Table 3) 

According  to  the  concept  description  of  performance  requirement  and  the  keyword 
description  of  each  leverage  point,  performance  is  more  close  to  leverage  point  3.  That’s 
because  performance  as  a  risk  management  target  and  a  connecter  of  all  model  elements 
(involves the physical maintenance, feedback loops etc.) helps to improve the service quality 
and  ensure  the  customer  retention.  This  right  matches  with  leverage  point  3  which  also 
mentioned a system goal and increase of market share.

In the previous research, we already mapped all cloud risk causal risks with leverage pints, 
integrate  with  performance  target,  the  holistic  risk  management  model  for  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service environment as follows: (See Figure 6)  

 

Figure 6.The cloud multimedia streaming service applied risk management

    The  above  figure  shows  a  leveraged  risk  controlling  model  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing. Based on the initial BMIS model and the cloud applied leveraged 
remodeling,  with  considering  of  the  specific  character  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we 
got a performance targeted leveraged BMIS model.

   This is a hollow sphere model which involves performance requirement and all cloud risk 
causal factors in it. Compared with the initial BMIS’ “pairwise correlation”, the performance 
spherical shell at outermost layer associate all four elements to ensure the orientation of risk 
control.  In  the  spherical  shell,  as  the  second  layer,  four  elements  supervise  the  different 
aspects of the management system, and the element also parewise connected with each other. 
Inside the four elements, as the third layer, all sorts of cloud risk causal factors take charge of 
micro-control  in  detail.  Cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  as  a  cloud  based  service,  the 
basic  risk  and  problems  can  be  controlled  by  internal  factors  of  each  element,  the  external 
performance target helps to improve the effectiveness of model operation.  
 
4. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service  in  cloud  computing.  In  cloud  service  industry,  the  risk  always  points  to  bi -
direction,  both  cloud  service  providers  and  cloud  service  clients  can  be  subjected  to 
damage.  Traditional  security  models  tend  to  corporate  in  house  environment,  regard 
outsourcing  or  third  party  as  a  business  issue  that  only  address  at  contractual  or  legal 
level.  The  initial  BMIS  model  is  an  interactive  and  dynamic  model,  which  can  act  on 
both internal and external sides. Based on the cloud applied leveraged BMIS model, we 
considerate  the  new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  remodel  and 
adjust  this  model  to  cloud  streaming  area.  Cloud  based  broadcasters  and  relevant 
enterprises can use this model for a performance targeted effective risk management. 

Although  this  model  takes  the  specific  consideration  on  multimedia  streaming  service, 
leverage the resource allocation, aim to effectuate the risk management, but the lack of model 
verification is still an insufficiency for this paper. Quantitative decision-making  method can 
be helpful for model verification and validation.  

In  the  further  work,  we  will  try  to  use  quantitative  method  such  as  AHP  to  enhance  the 
utilization  rate  of  this  model  and  strive  to  get  a  more  precisel  approach  for  cloud  based 
multimedia streaming risk management.

Abstract 

 

Along  with  internet  broadcasting  technology,  cloud  broadcasting  is  gradually  becoming 
the  development  tendency  to  audience  view.  But  the  problems  which  existed  in  cloud 
environment also may affect in cloud based multimedia streaming service area. In this paper, 
we  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming  service  in  cloud 
computing. Through previous study, we recommended a leveraged BMIS model for cloud risk 
management. To apply this model into cloud broadcasting environment, considerate with the 
new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we  found  the  significance  of 
performance  in  cloud  based  streaming  service.  Then  we  integrate  and  leverage  the  new 
feature to the remodeled BMIS model, and finally develop a performance targeted leveraged 
BMIS model for cloud multimedia streaming risk management.

1. Introduction 

Traditional  multimedia  broadcasters  use  the  physical  TV  network  to  distribute  their 
programs,  there  are  occasional  service  interrupt  or  breakdown  during  the  broadcasting. 
Nowadays  with the development of information technology, internet TV, IPTV, Mobile TV 
etc. racing to emerge in  audience's view. Cloud based multimedia streaming service already 
moved on the agenda. Through cloud computing, broadcasters can hold  down their costs by 
using  the  infrastructure  and  software  service  provided  by  the  cloud  providers,  and  more 
convenient  access  to  the  latest  technical  advances.  For  audiences,  cloud  based  multimedia 
streaming service can offer a more interactive and higher definition image transmission. 

But the problems here are more severe and various in cloud environment. Issues like users’ 
privacy,  service  attack  and  more  kinds  of  potential  problems  lurk  in  cloud  may  in  cloud 
multimedia  streaming  service.  These  make  the  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing is meaningful and imperative.  

Business  Model  for  Information  Security  (BMIS)  is  a  widely  recognized  and  available 
model published by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). This is a 
generalized  and  dynamic  security  model  which  stands  on  a  business  level.  To  apply  this 
model  to  cloud  computing,  we  proposed  a  leveraged  BMIS  model  by  analysis  of  practical 
cloud risk causal factors in our previous research [9]. But this is a general cloud risk control 
model; for multimedia streaming service area, there must be some new characters need to be 
taken  into  consideration.  This  paper  direct  at  cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  area, 
explore the new feature in this environment, try to apply the leveraged BMIS model to it and 
find an approach for risk management in this environment.

The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the related 
work of this paper. This section describes the situation of cloud based multimedia streaming 
service  and  the  previous  related  work.  Section  3,  which  is  the  core  part  of  this  paper,  gets 
under  way  of  model  building.  It  includes  three  steps:  first  find  out  the  new  requirement  in 
multimedia streaming service, then explore the association between the new requirement and 
the  initial  BMIS  model,  finally  mapping  the  leverage  point  to  new  requirement  for  model 
implementation. Section 4 makes the conclusions of this paper, describes the advantage and 
meaning of the whole work, also point out the shortcomings of this paper.

2.1. Present development of multimedia broadcasting and existing problems 

 In  multimedia  broadcasting,  from  DVB  (Digital  Video  Broadcasting)  to  DMB  (Digital 
Multimedia  Broadcasting)  or  MBMS  (Multimedia  Broadcast  Multicast  Service),  the  digital 
data  transmission  technology  is  nowadays  in  a  rapid  development.  DVB,  for  example,  has 
already experienced two generations. The first generation brought the specifications of DVB-
S/T/C Digital Video Broadcasting- Satellite /  Terrestrial/Cable) and we got the standards of 
DVB-S2,  DVB-T2,  DVB-C2  in  the  second  generation.  Nowadays,  the  DVB-HDTV,  DVB-
3DTV,  especially  plus  with  GEM  (Globally  Executable  Middleware)  [1],  broadcasting  is 
closing to connection with internet little by little. Take advantage of the Java Micro Edition 
platform and specific APIs, GEM based DVB can realize four aspects:  Broadcast, Packaged 
Media,  IPTV,  and  Over-The-Top  (OTT),  each  of  them  has  an  inevitable  connection  with 
internet transmission (See Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1. The structure of GEM target specifications [1] 

 

The  digital  data  transmission  technology  has  mushroomed  with  the  birth  of  DVB 
broadcasting. From the initial MPEG-1(like mp3 format) to MPEG-2 (widely used in  Cable 
TV)  and  MPEG-4  (widely  used  in  internet  TV)  and  the  recent  many  kinds  of  adaptive 
streaming,  such  as  Apple’s  HLS  (HTTP  Live  Streaming),  Microsoft’s  Smooth  Streaming, 
Adobe’s  HDS  (HTTP  Dynamic  Streaming),  MPEG-DASH  (Dynamic  Adaptive  Streaming 
over HTTP), media contents gained a more and more higher quality transmission during the 
streaming  technology  development.  During  the  broadcast,  the  data  transmitted  by  a  form 
named streaming. Here the streaming is a compression and download method which splits a 
traditional  file  into  many  blocks  and  can  be  played  during  these  blocks  are  downloading 
through the internet.

MPEG-DASH, for instance, is a recent hottest topic of streaming technology in multimedia 
broadcasting.  It  so-called  can  unifying  the  adaptive  streaming  world  which  can  provide  the 
highest  quality  of  video  transmission  according  to  the  bandwidth  variation  at  any  moment. 
Besides, it also furnishes a series of functions such as Time-shift viewing [2], Ads insertion [2, 
3], Clock-drift control for live streaming [3, 4] and so on. Since transmitted through internet, 
it also supports a common encryption with multi-DRM system for contents protection. Where 
is an internet, there always goes with risk and security problems, contents protection should 
be indisputably take consideration in broadcast streaming service.  
 
2.2. Cloud computing in television and broadcasting industry 

Traditional TV broadcasters need to own their infrastructure for contents collection, editing 
and processing in suitable formats etc. which need to take big investment in  manpower and 
material  resources.  What’s  more,  it  needs  constant  update  and  maintenance  which  will  take 
more costs. Cloud computing suits the remedy to the case. 

Since the multimedia streaming service (like IPTV, OTT) always interact with the Internet, 
thus make it possible for utilization of cloud computing in multimedia broadcasting industry.  
Figure  2  depicts  the  fusion  of  traditional  TV  and  cloud  based  streaming  service 
broadcasting  system.  Traditionally,  the  contents  providers  need  to  edit  and  compress  the 
programs by their own installations and then distribute to customers through the basic DVB 
network;  through  the  cloud  streaming  service,  use  the  cloud  software  to  do  graphics  and 
compression,  media  contents  can  transmit  to  both  cable  TV  customers  and  PC,  Mobile 
devices. 
 

 

Figure 2. Fusion system of traditional TV and cloud based streaming service 

  

Cloud computing is well known with three kinds of service: SaaS (Software as a service), 
PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). The same thing can be bring 
into  broadcast  streaming  service.  For  multimedia  broadcasters,  SaaS  cloud  can  offer  virtual 
desktop,  graphics;  PaaS  cloud  can  provide  OS  (Operating  system),  database,  development 
tool and web server; IaaS cloud can supply virtual machine, storage, metadata backup, etc. [5]. 
Now  a  lot  of  enterprises  have  already  moved  to  cloud  based  broadcasting  service.  Axis 
World  Graphics,  for  example,  one  of  the  first  entrants  into  the  cloud  based  broadcast  area 
which  provides  contents  creation  software  and  custom  graphic  [5];  Qtube  supply  browser, 
edit  and  transformer  to  users  or  content  creators  and  ensure  they  can  interact  with,  edit,  or 
view  their  contents  [6].  In  China,  PaaS  cloud  also  has  been  put  into  agenda.  The  CCTV

(China  Central  Television  Station)  stated  this  already  developed  two  platform  for  cloud 
computing;  the  news  cloud  platform  and  content  service  cloud  platform,  and  pointed  that 
cloud  computing  will  be  the  core  technology  in  tri-network  integration  and  China’s  NGB 
(Next Generation of Broadcasting television network) plan [7].  

Cloud based streaming service saves troubles of maintenance also reduces the production 
costs for broadcasters and supply a high quality image transmission to their customers, but the 
contents  management  will  be  an  arduous  task.  Cloud  itself  breeds  the  potential  risk  and 
security problems.   
 
2.3. BMIS and cloud applied BMIS model 

The original BMIS model is a property belongs to ISACA (Information Systems Audit and 
Control  Association)  and  the  full  name  of  BMIS  is  the  Business  Model  for  Information 
Security  [8].  It’s  a  three-dimensional,  pyramid-shaped  model  and  there  are  four  elements 
(organization, people, process, and technology) and six dynamic interconnections (governing, 
culture, enabling and support, emergence, human factors, and architecture) in the construction 
of this model (See it in Figure 3). 

 

 

Figure 3. Business Model for Information Security 

 
BMIS model aims to recognize and accommodate dynamic relationships both internal and 
external to the business. Cloud computing service can be counted as a third-party service in 
essence, thus it’s more probable under threats of both internal and external aspects. BMIS acts 
appropriately to the situation, according to ISACA, BMIS is a predictive and proactive model, 
not  just  concerning  traditional  information  security  but  including  privacy,  linkage  to  risk, 
physical  security  and  compliance  [8].  Furthermore,  BMIS  model  is  labeled  as  the 
combination  of  information  security  program  and  business  goals,  which  right  match  the 
ultimate purpose of enterprise operation: benefit and effectiveness.  

To apply to cloud environment, through analysis [9], we found the essentially causal risk 
factors  for  each  kind  of  cloud  service  problem,  (See  it  in  table1)  and  mapped  them  into 
BMIS’s  four  elements  respectively  (See  it in  Table  2).  To  enhance the  effectiveness  of  this 
model, we developed it use system leverage points and proposed a leveraged BMIS model in 
the  previous  research.  The  leveraged  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  ensure  the  risk  control 
directly focus on the realistic problems in cloud computing and the leverage points supply a

management  mode  to  optimize  the  resource  of  cloud  related  enterprise.  Cloud  based 
streaming service, as one kind of cloud service can also under administration of this model.

The concept of leverage is one of the most powerful in all of science. Archimedes proved 
the Law of the Lever and applied the law in a variety of inventions. Historian John Tzetzes, 
writing in the 12th century, wrote that Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and with a 
lever I will move the world" [10]. In systems thinking a leverage point is a place in a system's 
structure where a solution element can be applied. It's a low leverage point if a small amount 
of change force causes a small change in system behavior. It's a high leverage point if a small 
amount of change force causes a large change in system behavior [11]. 

An  article  named  “Leverage  points  to  intervene  in  a  system”  was  published  in  1999  by 
Donella Meadows [12].  Meadows,  who  worked  in  the  field  of  systems  analysis,  proposed a 
scale  of  places  to  intervene  in  a  system.  Awareness  and  manipulation  of  these  levers  is  an 
aspect  of  self-organization  and  can  lead  to  collective  intelligence.  In  this  article,  there  are 
twelve leverage points listed as below:  

① Power to transcend paradigms 

② Mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises  

③ The Goal of the system 

④ Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure 

⑤ Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints) 

⑥ Structure of information flow

The  twelve  leverage  points  listed  in  order of  system  components’  importance. Compared 
with BMIS model, it also mentioned some elements: structure, organization, human factor in 
detail, and gives an ordinary sequence for these elements which you should pay attention in a 
system.  It’s  sure  that  there  is  a  leverage  point  in  every  system;  we  can  make  the  resource 
optimization  by  mapping  with  leverage  points.  This  twelve  leverage  points  lead  a  resource 
integration  concept,  and  can  be  helpful  to  optimize  the  resource  distribution.  In  the  light  of 
resource  optimization,  leverage  points  means  getting  the  maximum  output  with  a  minimum 
input,  the  management  model  can  be  more  benefited  through  the  leverage  point  mapping 
process. 
 
3. Model Building 
 
3.1.  New  requirement  exploration 
management 

in  cloud  based  multimedia  streaming  risk 

To control the potential risk in cloud based multimedia streaming service,  compared with 
general  cloud  service;  we  first  need  to  excavate  the  different  requirements  in  multimedia 
streaming area.  

Practically,  to  begin  with,  there  is  different  user  scope  in  multimedia  streaming  service. 
General  cloud  service  always  more  tend  to  specific  group  or  certain  people.  For  example, 

290

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol.9, No.4 (2014) 
 

 
cloud  ERP  designed  for  business  users  in  most  case;  cloud  healthcare  service  focus  on 
patients; cloud gaming always serve for gamers; much less, PaaS and IaaS oriented cloud are 
much  more  tend  to  professionals  to  use.  However,  there  is  no  specific  or  certain  group  for 
multimedia  streaming  service;  everyone  can  be  an  audience  of  streaming  broadcast.  Cloud 
based streaming service need to serve more general people which require a more humanized 
and simplified UI (user interface) design. In the second place, multimedia streaming service is 
more  value  on  quality  of  service  (QoS).  It’s  because streaming  service  itself  is  labeled as it 
can supply more interaction and higher image quality to users compared with traditional TV 
broadcasting. Not just it can be use or not, but whether it can provide a smooth,  continuous 
and high definition streaming is very important to users. This requires a good user experience 
which called UX in service aspect. In another word, unworkable user interface and unstable 
or inferior image transmission will bring a risk in multimedia streaming service. Both UX and 
UI problems are eventually attributed to one aspect: performance [13, 14]. 

Academically, Kent pointed that the relative performance importance is different between 
connection-oriented and broadcast environment. The system performance must be taken into 
account when designing protocols for secure communication [15]. 

Through  above  analysis,  performance  undoubtedly  is  a  important  role  in  cloud  based 

streaming service risk management. 

Detailedly，performance is a requirement or a target in cloud based streaming risk control 

process. It can involve three aspects in streaming service problems. 

① A workable UI: Not just the deliberate sabotage but also the feasibility of the system itself 
bring  a  risk  in  service  operation.  This  aspect  can  be  affected  by  technology  support  and 
human resource. More sufficient technology support and human resource will ensure a more 
interactive and humanized user interface. 

② A good UX: Even if there is no external hostile aggression, the breakage physical network 
or since the problems from protocols and various kinds of firewall, users may be subjected to 
video frequency interrupt risk such as 4XX client error or 5XX server error or repeated 3XX 
redirection  message  [16].  This  aspect  refers  to  user  feedback  message  and  process  control, 
constant  and  real-time  monitoring  can  help  to  discover  the  problem  in  time  and  ensure  a 
smooth multimedia streaming service for users. 

③ SLA requirement: The word performance itself, for cloud based streaming service, means 
it should provides a high quality, high resolution image and high bandwidth service to users 
as  much  as  possible.  This  aspect  refers  to  the  contract  quality  problem,  service  level 
agreement (SLA) should responsible for the performance in contract level [17]. A good and 
clear performance clause will reduces the unnecessary contractual dispute risk. 

 

3.2. The connection between the new requirement and cloud applied BMIS model 

In  previous  work,  we  proposed  a  cloud  applied  leveraged  BMIS  model  to  make  an 
effective risk management in cloud environment. It operates like figure 4, each element take 
charge  of  several  cloud  risk  causal  factors,  and  each  factor  is  assigned  one  appropriate 
leverage point to optimize the resource allocation.

Figure 4. Cloud applied leveraged BMIS model [9] 

 

 

The  proposed  risk  management  model  supplies  an  integrated  risk  control  function  to 
general  cloud  service.  Although  the  basis  risk  control  for  cloud  broadcast  service  should 
comply  with  the  general  cloud  risk  control,  direct  using  of  this  model  to  the  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service area will be somewhat thoughtless. Through above analysis, we 
found the new requirement in cloud broadcast environment: the performance  requirement is 
requisite for risk management in cloud multimedia streaming service. To apply this leveraged 
BMIS  model  to  this  area, we  need  to  find  out the  connection  between  the  new requirement 
and the proposed cloud applied BMIS model. 

As mentioned above, performance requirement refers to three aspects. 
First, the UI aspect, it can involve technology and people elements in initial BMIS model. 
For technology element, it needs a “UI design” technique support. This factor do not exist in 
original leveraged BMIS model, it’s a new factor which we need to take into consideration in 
broadcast environment. For people element, it relates to “human resource” factor. 

Second, the UX aspect, it can connect with process element.  For detail level, it relates to 

the specific factor “feedback loops”  

Third, the SLA requirement, it can connect with organization element.  For detail level, it 

relates to the specific factor “contract (SLA)”. 

Thus  the  performance  requirement  involves  all  elements  existed  in  BMIS  model. 
Organization, people, process and technology, each element  holds a causal factor which can 
correspond with the performance requirement. The new relationship built as follows. (Figure 
5 below) 

 

Figure 5. Performance connection with cloud applied BMIS model

Figure  5  illustrates  the  performance  connection  with  cloud  applied  BMIS  model  the 
innermost foursquare represents the specific risk causal factors which under control of certain 
element;  the  intermediate  circle  represents  the  overlap  factors  which  correspond  with  the 
performance requirement; the  outermost foursquare on behalf of the four elements which in 
charge of all cloud risk causal factors. 

From the figure, it’s easy to see that the performance definitely not an individual factor but 
a connector for the holistic system. It’s worth noting that, performance here is a requirement 
which  can  associate  all  elements  in  BMIS  model;  it  also  can  be  seen  as  one  of  risk 
management  target  (although  the  ultimate  target  is  for  business  benefit  and  continuity)  in 
cloud multimedia streaming service environment. 
 
3.3. Cloud multimedia streaming service applied leveraged BMIS model  

Since performance as a new target and requirement added into the BMIS model for cloud 
multimedia  streaming  risk  management,  we  aim  to  find  the  new  item’s  leverage  point  for 
enhancing the effectiveness of this model.  

 In order to mapping performance with leverage point, first we need a better understanding 
of  the  meaning  of  every  leverage  point.  We  read  the  “twelve  leverage  points”  in-depth  and 
conclude the key conception of every leverage point as below. (See Table 3) 

According  to  the  concept  description  of  performance  requirement  and  the  keyword 
description  of  each  leverage  point,  performance  is  more  close  to  leverage  point  3.  That’s 
because  performance  as  a  risk  management  target  and  a  connecter  of  all  model  elements 
(involves the physical maintenance, feedback loops etc.) helps to improve the service quality 
and  ensure  the  customer  retention.  This  right  matches  with  leverage  point  3  which  also 
mentioned a system goal and increase of market share.

In the previous research, we already mapped all cloud risk causal risks with leverage pints, 
integrate  with  performance  target,  the  holistic  risk  management  model  for  specific  cloud 
multimedia streaming service environment as follows: (See Figure 6)  

 

Figure 6.The cloud multimedia streaming service applied risk management 

model 

 
    The  above  figure  shows  a  leveraged  risk  controlling  model  for  multimedia  streaming 
service in cloud computing. Based on the initial BMIS model and the cloud applied leveraged 
remodeling,  with  considering  of  the  specific  character  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  we 
got a performance targeted leveraged BMIS model.

   This is a hollow sphere model which involves performance requirement and all cloud risk 
causal factors in it. Compared with the initial BMIS’ “pairwise correlation”, the performance 
spherical shell at outermost layer associate all four elements to ensure the orientation of risk 
control.  In  the  spherical  shell,  as  the  second  layer,  four  elements  supervise  the  different 
aspects of the management system, and the element also parewise connected with each other. 
Inside the four elements, as the third layer, all sorts of cloud risk causal factors take charge of 
micro-control  in  detail.  Cloud  multimedia  streaming  service  as  a  cloud  based  service,  the 
basic  risk  and  problems  can  be  controlled  by  internal  factors  of  each  element,  the  external 
performance target helps to improve the effectiveness of model operation.  
 
4. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposes  an  approach  of  risk  management  for  multimedia  streaming 
service  in  cloud  computing.  In  cloud  service  industry,  the  risk  always  points  to  bi -
direction,  both  cloud  service  providers  and  cloud  service  clients  can  be  subjected  to 
damage.  Traditional  security  models  tend  to  corporate  in  house  environment,  regard 
outsourcing  or  third  party  as  a  business  issue  that  only  address  at  contractual  or  legal 
level.  The  initial  BMIS  model  is  an  interactive  and  dynamic  model,  which  can  act  on 
both internal and external sides. Based on the cloud applied leveraged BMIS model, we 
considerate  the  new  feature  required  in  multimedia  streaming  service,  remodel  and 
adjust  this  model  to  cloud  streaming  area.  Cloud  based  broadcasters  and  relevant 
enterprises can use this model for a performance targeted effective risk management. 

Although  this  model  takes  the  specific  consideration  on  multimedia  streaming  service, 
leverage the resource allocation, aim to effectuate the risk management, but the lack of model 
verification is still an insufficiency for this paper. Quantitative decision-making  method can 
be helpful for model verification and validation.  

In  the  further  work,  we  will  try  to  use  quantitative  method  such  as  AHP  to  enhance  the 
utilization  rate  of  this  model  and  strive  to  get  a  more  precisel  approach  for  cloud  based 
multimedia streaming risk management.
