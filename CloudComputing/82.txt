Abstract 

Though the information technology outsourcing (ITO) can help many companies to reduce 
the  total  costs  of  their  information  technology  (IT)  projects  and  seek  a  more  efficient 
allocation of resources, the ITO-based projects probably have the insecure risks of unexpected 
costs  and  even  the  failure  of  the  whole  project.  After  the  quantitative  analysis  with  the 
principal-agent  theory  towards  the  security  problem  of  the  ITO-based  projects,  a  new 
incentive  reward-punishment  model  was  proposed  in  this  paper,  in  order  to  reduce  the  ITO 
insecure risk and generate optimal contract under the asymmetric information condition. The 
experimental results show that the construction of the new model has positive significance for 
guiding the outsourcing enterprise management in security.

insecure and then will cause much or little loss of the companies. For the outsourcing clients, 
these  issues  especially  entail  the  risks  that  lead  to  serous  negative  consequences.  Cao  and

2. Modeling Risk Factors of ITO-Based Projects According to Security 

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as 

the following function f. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Here, 

  represents 

the  probability  of 

this  uncertainty,  and 

  represents  the 

consequence of the uncertainty. 

As  for  the  ITO  risk,  this  uncertainty  is  the  major  deterrent  of  the  ITO-based  project  [5]. 
This uncertainty originated from the implementation deviation in the process of the ITO-based 
project. If the enterprises neglect the detailed analysis of the risk and do not use the effective 
preventive measures against the risk, they will perhaps encounter with much loss. 

So  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  risk  factors  of  the  ITO-based  projects  and  the  control 
strategies  against  the  risks,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  security  requirements  of  the  ITO  industry. 
The workflow of the ITO-based project is completed by the outsourcers and the vendors. The 
risk factors refer to the three major objects of the outsourcers, the vendors and the transaction 
processes. 

Firstly, the  following  risk  factors  from the outsourcers may cause the security problem of 

the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Difficulty to make the decision about the optimal outsourcer of the ITO-based projects; 

(2) Difficulty for the outsourcer to learn new IT knowledge; 

(3) Difficulty to combine the IT resources outside the company into the business process of 

the company. 

Secondly, the following risk factors from the vendors may also lead to the security problem 

of the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Lack of IT professional techniques for the vendors; 

(2) Business speculation; 

(3) Insufficient financial resources. 

As a matter of routine,  the  outsourcers  pre-pay a small  part of  money, which are still not 
enough  for  the  large-scale  outsourcing,  when  they  sign  the  contracts.  Afterwards,  if  the 
ITO-based project is interrupted in an emergency, the insecure risks of the outsourcers will be 
produced.  Therefore,  the  strong  economic  strengths  of  the  venders  should  be  checked 
carefully to deal with the possible insecure risks. 

Finally,  the  following  risk  factors  in  the  transaction  process  are  also  insecure  for  the 

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Abstract 

Though the information technology outsourcing (ITO) can help many companies to reduce 
the  total  costs  of  their  information  technology  (IT)  projects  and  seek  a  more  efficient 
allocation of resources, the ITO-based projects probably have the insecure risks of unexpected 
costs  and  even  the  failure  of  the  whole  project.  After  the  quantitative  analysis  with  the 
principal-agent  theory  towards  the  security  problem  of  the  ITO-based  projects,  a  new 
incentive  reward-punishment  model  was  proposed  in  this  paper,  in  order  to  reduce  the  ITO 
insecure risk and generate optimal contract under the asymmetric information condition. The 
experimental results show that the construction of the new model has positive significance for 
guiding the outsourcing enterprise management in security.

1. Introduction 

Information  technology  outsourcing  (ITO)  is  one  of  the  basic  outsourcing  forms  in 
companies, and it is developed on some computer theories and application technologies. Since 
the 1990s, the outsourcing has been very popular for the IT projects in many companies, and 
the typical successful example is Eastman Kodak's externalization of the information systems. 
Nowadays,  the  ITO  is  often  regarded  as  an  attractive  business  proposition  to  improve  the 
productivity of the IT projects, reduce the costs and increase the competitive ability [1]. The 
firms  can  obtain  numerous  benefits  from  outsourcing  some  services  of  the  information 
systems. At the same time, the ITO perhaps causes an increasing number of decision problems, 
such  as  the  choice  of  developing  the  projects  by  themselves  or  outsourcing  the  projects  to 
others,  the  selection  of  the  service  providers,  and  the  identification  of  the  most  appropriate 
approach  to  manage  the  outsourcing  contracts  [2].  Wrong  decision  often  makes  the  projects 
insecure and then will cause much or little loss of the companies. For the outsourcing clients, 
these  issues  especially  entail  the  risks  that  lead  to  serous  negative  consequences.  Cao  and 
Chen found that the ITO-based projects had high risks, and the degrees of the risks are various 
in different periods of the projects [3]. Bahli and Rivard proposed a number of risk-assessment 
frameworks  and  risk-management  strategies  for  the  ITO-based  projects  [4].  However,  very 
little attention has been paid to design the optimal secure contracts and accomplish the mutual 
benefit goal of the entire project according to the circumstance with asymmetric information. 

In this paper, the past relative researches were firstly analyzed to attain a synthesis of the 
main  issues  about  the  ITO  risks  and  the  relative  risk  managements.  In  Section  2,  the  risk 
factors of the ITO-based projects were modeled to satisfy the security requirements. In Section 
3, the example of the rick control system was designed with the cloud computing and security 
models, in order to make the information technology outsourcing secure for the IT project of 
the company.

2. Modeling Risk Factors of ITO-Based Projects According to Security 

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as 

the following function f. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Here, 

  represents 

the  probability  of 

this  uncertainty,  and 

  represents  the 

consequence of the uncertainty. 

As  for  the  ITO  risk,  this  uncertainty  is  the  major  deterrent  of  the  ITO-based  project  [5]. 
This uncertainty originated from the implementation deviation in the process of the ITO-based 
project. If the enterprises neglect the detailed analysis of the risk and do not use the effective 
preventive measures against the risk, they will perhaps encounter with much loss. 

So  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  risk  factors  of  the  ITO-based  projects  and  the  control 
strategies  against  the  risks,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  security  requirements  of  the  ITO  industry. 
The workflow of the ITO-based project is completed by the outsourcers and the vendors. The 
risk factors refer to the three major objects of the outsourcers, the vendors and the transaction 
processes. 

Firstly, the  following  risk  factors  from the outsourcers may cause the security problem of 

the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Difficulty to make the decision about the optimal outsourcer of the ITO-based projects; 

(2) Difficulty for the outsourcer to learn new IT knowledge; 

(3) Difficulty to combine the IT resources outside the company into the business process of 

the company. 

Secondly, the following risk factors from the vendors may also lead to the security problem 

of the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Lack of IT professional techniques for the vendors; 

(2) Business speculation; 

(3) Insufficient financial resources. 

As a matter of routine,  the  outsourcers  pre-pay a small  part of  money, which are still not 
enough  for  the  large-scale  outsourcing,  when  they  sign  the  contracts.  Afterwards,  if  the 
ITO-based project is interrupted in an emergency, the insecure risks of the outsourcers will be 
produced.  Therefore,  the  strong  economic  strengths  of  the  venders  should  be  checked 
carefully to deal with the possible insecure risks. 

Finally,  the  following  risk  factors  in  the  transaction  process  are  also  insecure  for  the 

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Through the above calculation results, it can be seen that the maximum expected returns of 
the outsourcer are very different due to different operation abilities, risk attitudes, effort cost 
coefficients  and  supervision  cost  coefficients  between  the  two  venders.  Meanwhile,  the 
different  profit  sharing  coefficients  and  the  different  reward-punishment  coefficients  of  the 
outsourcer  are  also  the  reasons.  With  other  equal  conditions,  the  vender  A  is  more  suitable 
than the vender B for the outsourcer. 

The example is verified with the BP neural network, as shown in Figure 1. The BP neural 
network is comprised of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer.

Nowadays,  the  ITO  is  often  regarded  as  an  attractive  business  proposition  to  improve  the 
productivity of the IT projects, reduce the costs and increase the competitive ability [1]. The 
firms  can  obtain  numerous  benefits  from  outsourcing  some  services  of  the  information 
systems. At the same time, the ITO perhaps causes an increasing number of decision problems, 
such  as  the  choice  of  developing  the  projects  by  themselves  or  outsourcing  the  projects  to 
others,  the  selection  of  the  service  providers,  and  the  identification  of  the  most  appropriate 
approach  to  manage  the  outsourcing  contracts  [2].  Wrong  decision  often  makes  the  projects 
insecure and then will cause much or little loss of the companies. For the outsourcing clients, 
these  issues  especially  entail  the  risks  that  lead  to  serous  negative  consequences.  Cao  and 
Chen found that the ITO-based projects had high risks, and the degrees of the risks are various 
in different periods of the projects [3]. Bahli and Rivard proposed a number of risk-assessment 
frameworks  and  risk-management  strategies  for  the  ITO-based  projects  [4].  However,  very 
little attention has been paid to design the optimal secure contracts and accomplish the mutual 
benefit goal of the entire project according to the circumstance with asymmetric information. 

In this paper, the past relative researches were firstly analyzed to attain a synthesis of the 
main  issues  about  the  ITO  risks  and  the  relative  risk  managements.  In  Section  2,  the  risk 
factors of the ITO-based projects were modeled to satisfy the security requirements. In Section 
3, the example of the rick control system was designed with the cloud computing and security 
models, in order to make the information technology outsourcing secure for the IT project of 
the company.

2. Modeling Risk Factors of ITO-Based Projects According to Security 

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as 

the following function f. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Here, 

  represents 

the  probability  of 

this  uncertainty,  and 

  represents  the 

consequence of the uncertainty. 

As  for  the  ITO  risk,  this  uncertainty  is  the  major  deterrent  of  the  ITO-based  project  [5]. 
This uncertainty originated from the implementation deviation in the process of the ITO-based 
project. If the enterprises neglect the detailed analysis of the risk and do not use the effective 
preventive measures against the risk, they will perhaps encounter with much loss. 

So  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  risk  factors  of  the  ITO-based  projects  and  the  control 
strategies  against  the  risks,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  security  requirements  of  the  ITO  industry. 
The workflow of the ITO-based project is completed by the outsourcers and the vendors. The 
risk factors refer to the three major objects of the outsourcers, the vendors and the transaction 
processes. 

Firstly, the  following  risk  factors  from the outsourcers may cause the security problem of 

the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Difficulty to make the decision about the optimal outsourcer of the ITO-based projects; 

(2) Difficulty for the outsourcer to learn new IT knowledge; 

(3) Difficulty to combine the IT resources outside the company into the business process of 

the company. 

Secondly, the following risk factors from the vendors may also lead to the security problem 

of the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Lack of IT professional techniques for the vendors; 

(2) Business speculation; 

(3) Insufficient financial resources. 

As a matter of routine,  the  outsourcers  pre-pay a small  part of  money, which are still not 
enough  for  the  large-scale  outsourcing,  when  they  sign  the  contracts.  Afterwards,  if  the 
ITO-based project is interrupted in an emergency, the insecure risks of the outsourcers will be 
produced.  Therefore,  the  strong  economic  strengths  of  the  venders  should  be  checked 
carefully to deal with the possible insecure risks. 

Finally,  the  following  risk  factors  in  the  transaction  process  are  also  insecure  for  the 

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Through the above calculation results, it can be seen that the maximum expected returns of 
the outsourcer are very different due to different operation abilities, risk attitudes, effort cost 
coefficients  and  supervision  cost  coefficients  between  the  two  venders.  Meanwhile,  the 
different  profit  sharing  coefficients  and  the  different  reward-punishment  coefficients  of  the 
outsourcer  are  also  the  reasons.  With  other  equal  conditions,  the  vender  A  is  more  suitable 
than the vender B for the outsourcer. 

The example is verified with the BP neural network, as shown in Figure 1. The BP neural 
network is comprised of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer.

Abstract 

Though the information technology outsourcing (ITO) can help many companies to reduce 
the  total  costs  of  their  information  technology  (IT)  projects  and  seek  a  more  efficient 
allocation of resources, the ITO-based projects probably have the insecure risks of unexpected 
costs  and  even  the  failure  of  the  whole  project.  After  the  quantitative  analysis  with  the 
principal-agent  theory  towards  the  security  problem  of  the  ITO-based  projects,  a  new 
incentive  reward-punishment  model  was  proposed  in  this  paper,  in  order  to  reduce  the  ITO 
insecure risk and generate optimal contract under the asymmetric information condition. The 
experimental results show that the construction of the new model has positive significance for 
guiding the outsourcing enterprise management in security.

1. Introduction 

Information  technology  outsourcing  (ITO)  is  one  of  the  basic  outsourcing  forms  in 
companies, and it is developed on some computer theories and application technologies. Since 
the 1990s, the outsourcing has been very popular for the IT projects in many companies, and 
the typical successful example is Eastman Kodak's externalization of the information systems. 
Nowadays,  the  ITO  is  often  regarded  as  an  attractive  business  proposition  to  improve  the 
productivity of the IT projects, reduce the costs and increase the competitive ability [1]. The 
firms  can  obtain  numerous  benefits  from  outsourcing  some  services  of  the  information 
systems. At the same time, the ITO perhaps causes an increasing number of decision problems, 
such  as  the  choice  of  developing  the  projects  by  themselves  or  outsourcing  the  projects  to 
others,  the  selection  of  the  service  providers,  and  the  identification  of  the  most  appropriate 
approach  to  manage  the  outsourcing  contracts  [2].  Wrong  decision  often  makes  the  projects 
insecure and then will cause much or little loss of the companies. For the outsourcing clients, 
these  issues  especially  entail  the  risks  that  lead  to  serous  negative  consequences.  Cao  and 
Chen found that the ITO-based projects had high risks, and the degrees of the risks are various 
in different periods of the projects [3]. Bahli and Rivard proposed a number of risk-assessment 
frameworks  and  risk-management  strategies  for  the  ITO-based  projects  [4].  However,  very 
little attention has been paid to design the optimal secure contracts and accomplish the mutual 
benefit goal of the entire project according to the circumstance with asymmetric information. 

In this paper, the past relative researches were firstly analyzed to attain a synthesis of the 
main  issues  about  the  ITO  risks  and  the  relative  risk  managements.  In  Section  2,  the  risk 
factors of the ITO-based projects were modeled to satisfy the security requirements. In Section 
3, the example of the rick control system was designed with the cloud computing and security 
models, in order to make the information technology outsourcing secure for the IT project of 
the company.

2. Modeling Risk Factors of ITO-Based Projects According to Security 

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as 

the following function f. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Here, 

  represents 

the  probability  of 

this  uncertainty,  and 

  represents  the 

consequence of the uncertainty. 

As  for  the  ITO  risk,  this  uncertainty  is  the  major  deterrent  of  the  ITO-based  project  [5]. 
This uncertainty originated from the implementation deviation in the process of the ITO-based 
project. If the enterprises neglect the detailed analysis of the risk and do not use the effective 
preventive measures against the risk, they will perhaps encounter with much loss. 

So  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  risk  factors  of  the  ITO-based  projects  and  the  control 
strategies  against  the  risks,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  security  requirements  of  the  ITO  industry. 
The workflow of the ITO-based project is completed by the outsourcers and the vendors. The 
risk factors refer to the three major objects of the outsourcers, the vendors and the transaction 
processes. 

Firstly, the  following  risk  factors  from the outsourcers may cause the security problem of 

the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Difficulty to make the decision about the optimal outsourcer of the ITO-based projects; 

(2) Difficulty for the outsourcer to learn new IT knowledge; 

(3) Difficulty to combine the IT resources outside the company into the business process of 

the company. 

Secondly, the following risk factors from the vendors may also lead to the security problem 

of the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Lack of IT professional techniques for the vendors; 

(2) Business speculation; 

(3) Insufficient financial resources. 

As a matter of routine,  the  outsourcers  pre-pay a small  part of  money, which are still not 
enough  for  the  large-scale  outsourcing,  when  they  sign  the  contracts.  Afterwards,  if  the 
ITO-based project is interrupted in an emergency, the insecure risks of the outsourcers will be 
produced.  Therefore,  the  strong  economic  strengths  of  the  venders  should  be  checked 
carefully to deal with the possible insecure risks. 

Finally,  the  following  risk  factors  in  the  transaction  process  are  also  insecure  for  the 

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Through the above calculation results, it can be seen that the maximum expected returns of 
the outsourcer are very different due to different operation abilities, risk attitudes, effort cost 
coefficients  and  supervision  cost  coefficients  between  the  two  venders.  Meanwhile,  the 
different  profit  sharing  coefficients  and  the  different  reward-punishment  coefficients  of  the 
outsourcer  are  also  the  reasons.  With  other  equal  conditions,  the  vender  A  is  more  suitable 
than the vender B for the outsourcer. 

The example is verified with the BP neural network, as shown in Figure 1. The BP neural 
network is comprised of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer.

With  the  rapid  development  of  information  technology  and  global  economy,  many 
prominent changes have occurred at the area of international trade in the past. One of the most 
important  changes  is  the  information  technology  outsourcing  (ITO),  which  is  the  main 
security topic of this paper. The  ITO  insecure risks  occur  in the implementation  steps of  the 
ITO-based  projects,  and  with  Principal-Agent  theory,  a  new  incentive  reward-punishment

Abstract 

Though the information technology outsourcing (ITO) can help many companies to reduce 
the  total  costs  of  their  information  technology  (IT)  projects  and  seek  a  more  efficient 
allocation of resources, the ITO-based projects probably have the insecure risks of unexpected 
costs  and  even  the  failure  of  the  whole  project.  After  the  quantitative  analysis  with  the 
principal-agent  theory  towards  the  security  problem  of  the  ITO-based  projects,  a  new 
incentive  reward-punishment  model  was  proposed  in  this  paper,  in  order  to  reduce  the  ITO 
insecure risk and generate optimal contract under the asymmetric information condition. The 
experimental results show that the construction of the new model has positive significance for 
guiding the outsourcing enterprise management in security. 
 

Key Words: Information Technology; Outsourcing; Security; Risk Management 

 
1. Introduction 

Information  technology  outsourcing  (ITO)  is  one  of  the  basic  outsourcing  forms  in 
companies, and it is developed on some computer theories and application technologies. Since 
the 1990s, the outsourcing has been very popular for the IT projects in many companies, and 
the typical successful example is Eastman Kodak's externalization of the information systems. 
Nowadays,  the  ITO  is  often  regarded  as  an  attractive  business  proposition  to  improve  the 
productivity of the IT projects, reduce the costs and increase the competitive ability [1]. The 
firms  can  obtain  numerous  benefits  from  outsourcing  some  services  of  the  information 
systems. At the same time, the ITO perhaps causes an increasing number of decision problems, 
such  as  the  choice  of  developing  the  projects  by  themselves  or  outsourcing  the  projects  to 
others,  the  selection  of  the  service  providers,  and  the  identification  of  the  most  appropriate 
approach  to  manage  the  outsourcing  contracts  [2].  Wrong  decision  often  makes  the  projects 
insecure and then will cause much or little loss of the companies. For the outsourcing clients, 
these  issues  especially  entail  the  risks  that  lead  to  serous  negative  consequences.  Cao  and 
Chen found that the ITO-based projects had high risks, and the degrees of the risks are various 
in different periods of the projects [3]. Bahli and Rivard proposed a number of risk-assessment 
frameworks  and  risk-management  strategies  for  the  ITO-based  projects  [4].  However,  very 
little attention has been paid to design the optimal secure contracts and accomplish the mutual 
benefit goal of the entire project according to the circumstance with asymmetric information. 

In this paper, the past relative researches were firstly analyzed to attain a synthesis of the 
main  issues  about  the  ITO  risks  and  the  relative  risk  managements.  In  Section  2,  the  risk 
factors of the ITO-based projects were modeled to satisfy the security requirements. In Section 
3, the example of the rick control system was designed with the cloud computing and security 
models, in order to make the information technology outsourcing secure for the IT project of 
the company.

2. Modeling Risk Factors of ITO-Based Projects According to Security 

Because uncertainty is one of the internal causes for the risk R, this risk can be described as 

the following function f. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Here, 

  represents 

the  probability  of 

this  uncertainty,  and 

  represents  the 

consequence of the uncertainty. 

As  for  the  ITO  risk,  this  uncertainty  is  the  major  deterrent  of  the  ITO-based  project  [5]. 
This uncertainty originated from the implementation deviation in the process of the ITO-based 
project. If the enterprises neglect the detailed analysis of the risk and do not use the effective 
preventive measures against the risk, they will perhaps encounter with much loss. 

So  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  risk  factors  of  the  ITO-based  projects  and  the  control 
strategies  against  the  risks,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  security  requirements  of  the  ITO  industry. 
The workflow of the ITO-based project is completed by the outsourcers and the vendors. The 
risk factors refer to the three major objects of the outsourcers, the vendors and the transaction 
processes. 

Firstly, the  following  risk  factors  from the outsourcers may cause the security problem of 

the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Difficulty to make the decision about the optimal outsourcer of the ITO-based projects; 

(2) Difficulty for the outsourcer to learn new IT knowledge; 

(3) Difficulty to combine the IT resources outside the company into the business process of 

the company. 

Secondly, the following risk factors from the vendors may also lead to the security problem 

of the ITO-based projects. 

(1) Lack of IT professional techniques for the vendors; 

(2) Business speculation; 

(3) Insufficient financial resources. 

As a matter of routine,  the  outsourcers  pre-pay a small  part of  money, which are still not 
enough  for  the  large-scale  outsourcing,  when  they  sign  the  contracts.  Afterwards,  if  the 
ITO-based project is interrupted in an emergency, the insecure risks of the outsourcers will be 
produced.  Therefore,  the  strong  economic  strengths  of  the  venders  should  be  checked 
carefully to deal with the possible insecure risks. 

Finally,  the  following  risk  factors  in  the  transaction  process  are  also  insecure  for  the 

ITO-based projects. 

(1) Much transaction cost out of the limit of the transaction process; 

(2) Inappropriate signed contracts of the transaction process. 

According  to  the  psychological  analysis,  the  behaviors  of  the  users  are  affected  by  the 
negative  affection  and  the  positive  reinforcement  from  the  environment.  The  positive 
reinforcement contains incentive and rewards, while the negative affection includes inhibition 
and punishment. In order to avoid the moral hazard of agent under the asymmetric information 
environment,  we  use  incentive  methods  to  spur  the  agent  to  work  hard.  In  addition,  the 
principle  agent  can  set  the  different  levels  according  to  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  task 
completed  by  the  agent,  and  then  gives  their  corresponding  incentives.  As  a  result,  the 
principal agent can knit the interests together, and they will also share the risks and the profits. 
With such a mechanism, the principal agent can prevent the speculative behavior of the agent, 
and avoid the moral hazard.

Suppose the effort level of the service supplied by the venders be t, and the corresponding

The effort cost function of the vender is shown below.

Here, b represents the constant that is greater than zero, and it is the cost coefficient of the 
vender.  If  the  constant  becomes  greater,  the  effort  level  t  will  be  bigger.  The  cost  function 

  satisfies the convexity conditions, and 

 

Suppose m be the benchmark level of hard work, which is decided by the outsourcers in the 
contract. If the effort level of the vender is less than the variable m, then the vender will face 
the  punishments.  If  the  effort  level  of  the  vender  is  greater  than  the  variable  m,  then  this 
person can get the rewards. The corresponding relationship can be represented below.

Here, 

  represents  the  incentive  coefficient  (

), 

  represents  the  monitoring 

variable,  whose  value  is  observed  by  the  outsourcers  through  supervising  the  effort  level  of 

the  venders.  Moreover, 

,  because 

  is  the  monitoring  variable,  and  this 

variable inevitably has the observation error 

. The error 

  satisfies the normal distribution, 

and its expectation is 0. The variance has the value 

, and the part 

  represents the 

initial  variance  of  the  monitoring  variable  on  the  condition  that  the  monitoring  costs  of  the 

outsourcer  are  zero. 

,  which  means  the  outsourcer  can  improve  the  accuracy 

range  of  the  supervision  through  some  technical  tools  and  methods.  For  example,  the 

outsourcer can install the intelligent video surveillance system, and hire some professionals to 

oversee the effort level of the vender. 

The supervision cost function of the outsourcer is described below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here,

The outsourcer can design the contract, which is represented below.

Here

  is  the  basic  wages, 

  is  a  sharing 

coefficient  in  the  profit,  and 

  reflects  the  changes  in  wages  caused  by  incentive  or 

punishment measures. 

Sometimes, the outsourcer is a risk neuter, while the vender is a risk evader. So the utility 
function  of  the  vender  has  the  characteristics  of  constantly  evading  absolute  risk,  and  this 
function is represented below.

Through the above calculation results, it can be seen that the maximum expected returns of 
the outsourcer are very different due to different operation abilities, risk attitudes, effort cost 
coefficients  and  supervision  cost  coefficients  between  the  two  venders.  Meanwhile,  the 
different  profit  sharing  coefficients  and  the  different  reward-punishment  coefficients  of  the 
outsourcer  are  also  the  reasons.  With  other  equal  conditions,  the  vender  A  is  more  suitable 
than the vender B for the outsourcer. 

The example is verified with the BP neural network, as shown in Figure 1. The BP neural 
network is comprised of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer.

The computing simulation of this BP neural network has the training results, as shown in 
Figure 2. Based on the results, we can choose the best company for the ITO task, and then the 
ITO-based project will get the better fruits.

Project 

 

The simulation can be made with the cloud computing tool, such as the CloudSim [6]. This 
open-source cloud computing simulation software was designed by University of Melbourne 
(Australia) grid laboratory and Gridbus project. We built a simulation environment (shown in 
Figure 3) with Oracle 10g JDeveloper for cloud computing in this ITO-based project.

4. Conclusions 

With  the  rapid  development  of  information  technology  and  global  economy,  many 
prominent changes have occurred at the area of international trade in the past. One of the most 
important  changes  is  the  information  technology  outsourcing  (ITO),  which  is  the  main 
security topic of this paper. The  ITO  insecure risks  occur  in the implementation  steps of  the 
ITO-based  projects,  and  with  Principal-Agent  theory,  a  new  incentive  reward-punishment 
model was proposed to generate the optimal contract on the asymmetric information condition. 
The  experimental  results  show  that  the  construction  of  this  new  model  has  positive 
significance for guiding the secure outsourcing enterprise management.
