Cloud  computing  is  used  by  many  organizations  and  the 
benefits  are  realized  by  general  public  in  many  ways. 
Examples for the Cloud service providers are IBM, Microsoft, 
Amazon,  and  Oracle  are  providing  various  kinds  of  cloud 
services.  The  services  may  include  Platform  as  a  Service 
(PaaS),  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS)  and  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service  (IaaS).  These  services  can  use  by  cloud  users  in  pay 
per use fashion without any investment. 
According  to  Subashini  and  Kavitha[1]  argues  that  cloud 
computing  is  used  by  small  and  medium  sized  companies  to 
increase  their  capacity  to  serve  for  their  clients  better  and

the cloud providers are address security issues in cloud storage 
with  high  level  priority.  It  has  been  observed  that  a  single 
cloud  usage  having  problems  in  service  availability,  failure 
rate,  and  insider  theft.  For  this  reason  there  was  considerable 
research  into  the  study  of  multiple-cloud  usage  for  curbing

INCREASE SECURITY IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

There  are  two  ways  to  increase  security  in  cloud  computing. 
The first way is  we have to identify the risks existed in cloud 
computing  related  to  security.  The  following  are  three 
important  security  risks  in  cloud  computing. The primary  risk 
is data integrity, secondary risk is data intrusion and final risk 
is  service  availability.  Data  integrity  causes  most  of  the 
security problems.  

This is because the data is very vulnerable to cloud users. The 
loss  of  data  integrity  is  having  severe  impact  on  them.  So 
Many researches were found this security risk [15], [21], [22] 
and  [23].  Data  intrusion  is  another  security  risk  which  is 
possible when hackers accessing the sensitive information.  

To  address  such  a  problem  considerable  research  was  done 
[24], [20]. Service availability is another security risk, which is 
very  important  from  the  view  of  client.  Cloud  clients  expect 
round the clock availability of cloud services. So many service 
availability  risks  were  exposed  in  [25],  [15],  [20],  and  [26]. 
The  second  way  to  increase  security  in  cloud  computing  is 
when  the  clouds  are  increased  then  the  security  is  also 
increased,  why  because  actually  a  single  cloud  is  also  having 
so  many  distributed  systems,  if  a  hacker  is  entered  in  to  the 
cloud and changes the data, then automatically the data in the 
distributed systems is also going to be changed, then that time 
multiple clouds can increase the security to the data rather than 
a single cloud.  

IV.  ARCHITECTURE 

 
In  this  paper  we  proposed  an  architecture  for  multiple-clouds 
which  is  similar  to  the  one  presented  in  [8].  The  architecture 
has  provisioned  for  multiple  clouds  that  work  together.  It  can 
be  called  as  cloud  within  clouds  or  cloud  of  clouds.  The 
architecture is as shown in below figure. 
As  can  be  seen  in  below  figure,  it  is  evident  that  the 
architecture  has  provisioned  for  multiple  clouds.  The  data 
outsourced by clients can store in any cloud. It does mean that 
the  multiple  clouds  working  together.  This  will  automatically 
improve service availability and reduce the risk of losing data 
and  improve  the  security.  With  regard  to  internal  theft  strict 
measures are to be used by cloud service providers. 
The above figure shows four clouds named as cloud1, cloud2, 
cloud3, cloud4, which is called as depsky cloud of clouds. Data 
is  stored  in  the  four  clouds  by  client  1,  which  means  that  by 
storing  the  data  in  to  the  multiple  obviously  the  security  also 
increased.  Also  shows  that  data  is  retrieved  by  the  multiple 
clouds by client 2 called as architecture of depsky.

(W/4 clouds, 2 clients) 

 

V.  PROTOTYPE APPLICATION 

in 

the  distributed 
We  built  a  prototype  application 
environment.  The  application  demonstrated  the  presence  of 
multiple clouds and their storage dynamics. This application is 
built  in  the  Java  platform  to  simulate  the  multiple-cloud 
environment. The environment used for the development of an 
application  is a PC  with  RAM (4  GB),  Core 2 dual processor 
running  Windows  7  operating  system.  Net  Beans  is  the  IDE, 
which is used for the development. The server programs were 
built in such a way, so that they are working together to reduce 
the risk of security. 

VI.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

From  the  experiments  done  on  the  multiple  clouds,  observed 
that, when numbers of clouds are increased, then the security 
is  also  increased  and  the  risk  is  reduced.  The  simulation 
results  reveal  this  fact.  The  following  is  the  figure  for  the 
number of clouds verses security. 

.

 

Fig. 2  Number of clouds vs. security 

 
As  can  be  seen  in  above  fig.  2,  it  is  evident  that  the 
horizontal  axis  represents  number  of  clouds  while 
the 
vertical  axis  represents  security.  The  results  reveal  that  the 
security is increased when number of clouds is increased.

INCREASE SECURITY IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

There  are  two  ways  to  increase  security  in  cloud  computing. 
The first way is  we have to identify the risks existed in cloud 
computing  related  to  security.  The  following  are  three 
important  security  risks  in  cloud  computing. The primary  risk 
is data integrity, secondary risk is data intrusion and final risk 
is  service  availability.  Data  integrity  causes  most  of  the 
security problems.  

This is because the data is very vulnerable to cloud users. The 
loss  of  data  integrity  is  having  severe  impact  on  them.  So 
Many researches were found this security risk [15], [21], [22] 
and  [23].  Data  intrusion  is  another  security  risk  which  is 
possible when hackers accessing the sensitive information.  

To  address  such  a  problem  considerable  research  was  done 
[24], [20]. Service availability is another security risk, which is 
very  important  from  the  view  of  client.  Cloud  clients  expect 
round the clock availability of cloud services. So many service 
availability  risks  were  exposed  in  [25],  [15],  [20],  and  [26]. 
The  second  way  to  increase  security  in  cloud  computing  is 
when  the  clouds  are  increased  then  the  security  is  also 
increased,  why  because  actually  a  single  cloud  is  also  having 
so  many  distributed  systems,  if  a  hacker  is  entered  in  to  the 
cloud and changes the data, then automatically the data in the 
distributed systems is also going to be changed, then that time 
multiple clouds can increase the security to the data rather than 
a single cloud.  

IV.  ARCHITECTURE 

 
In  this  paper  we  proposed  an  architecture  for  multiple-clouds 
which  is  similar  to  the  one  presented  in  [8].  The  architecture 
has  provisioned  for  multiple  clouds  that  work  together.  It  can 
be  called  as  cloud  within  clouds  or  cloud  of  clouds.  The 
architecture is as shown in below figure. 
As  can  be  seen  in  below  figure,  it  is  evident  that  the 
architecture  has  provisioned  for  multiple  clouds.  The  data 
outsourced by clients can store in any cloud. It does mean that 
the  multiple  clouds  working  together.  This  will  automatically 
improve service availability and reduce the risk of losing data 
and  improve  the  security.  With  regard  to  internal  theft  strict 
measures are to be used by cloud service providers. 
The above figure shows four clouds named as cloud1, cloud2, 
cloud3, cloud4, which is called as depsky cloud of clouds. Data 
is  stored  in  the  four  clouds  by  client  1,  which  means  that  by 
storing  the  data  in  to  the  multiple  obviously  the  security  also 
increased.  Also  shows  that  data  is  retrieved  by  the  multiple 
clouds by client 2 called as architecture of depsky.

V.  PROTOTYPE APPLICATION 

in 

the  distributed 
We  built  a  prototype  application 
environment.  The  application  demonstrated  the  presence  of 
multiple clouds and their storage dynamics. This application is 
built  in  the  Java  platform  to  simulate  the  multiple-cloud 
environment. The environment used for the development of an 
application  is a PC  with  RAM (4  GB),  Core 2 dual processor 
running  Windows  7  operating  system.  Net  Beans  is  the  IDE, 
which is used for the development. The server programs were 
built in such a way, so that they are working together to reduce 
the risk of security. 

VI.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

From  the  experiments  done  on  the  multiple  clouds,  observed 
that, when numbers of clouds are increased, then the security 
is  also  increased  and  the  risk  is  reduced.  The  simulation 
results  reveal  this  fact.  The  following  is  the  figure  for  the 
number of clouds verses security. 

.

 

Fig. 2  Number of clouds vs. security 

 
As  can  be  seen  in  above  fig.  2,  it  is  evident  that  the 
horizontal  axis  represents  number  of  clouds  while 
the 
vertical  axis  represents  security.  The  results  reveal  that  the 
security is increased when number of clouds is increased.

In  today’s  world  Cloud  computing  is  rapidly  growing.  Cloud 
users  are  eligible  to  get  services  with  less  cost  and  greater 
accessibility. However, their  security concerns are addressed. 
In this paper, we proposed an architecture that makes usage of 
multiple  clouds  together  to  improve  service  availability  and 
reducing  the  risk  of  data  losing.  We  have  implemented  a 
custom  Java  simulator  application  that  demonstrated  the 
usefulness of multiple clouds. The experimental results reveal 
that  the  multiple  clouds  are  having  capacity  of  increasing 
security.
