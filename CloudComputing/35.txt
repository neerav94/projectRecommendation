INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing 
is  a  service  delivery  framework 
allowing users to share resources. Hardware, software or 
application  service  can  be  enabled  on  demand  of  the 
consumers.  Cloud  Computing  adjusts  to  the  changing 
demands of the users and also spares them from investing 
huge  amounts  in  purchasing  of  hardware,  software  or 
even in infrastructure. [1] Cloud computing services offer 
the  pay-as-you-use  model,  hence  it  is  a  cost  effective 
model making IT management much responsive and user 
friendly  to  the  changing  needs.    [2]    Cloud  computing 
infrastructure  overcomes  the  physical  barriers  in  the 
system  and  automats  the  management  of  the  resources 
providing  users  in  the  cloud  with  the  computational 
services  and  data  storage  facilities.  The  user  base  can 
range from an individual to infinity.  [3]

I.2 Challenges in Cloud Computing 
 

Though  cloud  computing  is  a  brilliant  concept  of 
sharing  work  load  but  has  certain  challenges  associated 
with it.  The users may not be able to evenly assign their 
control over the data or application available at the cloud 
cluster.  Availability  and  usage  of  resource  affects  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  With  the  growing 
demand, there is an ever growing user base with each user 
expecting unlimited availability  of resource  or service in 
the  cloud  for  him.  Cloud  computing  has  to  meet  the 
expectations of all these users efficiently. Since data and 
disseminated 
the  open 
environment, data storage increases and becomes an issue 
in  handling  the  users  and  their  jobs  in  the  cloud. 
Maintaining the load information in this vast system and 
dispersing it to the right resource involves hefty cost.  As 
cloud  based  services  become  more  numerous  and 
dynamic, 
becomes  more 

resources  are

 Security,  stability,  work 

load  balance,  network 
bandwidth,  response  time,  transfer  delay,  data  transfer 
cost  etc  are  some  of  issues  in  Cloud  Computing  with 
Load Balancing being one of the major challenges. 

     The cyber (servers, routers) and physical (fibre etc.,) 
components account for initial provisioning and operation 
of  the  cloud  and  are  also  prone  to  attacks.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  allows  provisioning  and  operation  of 
the cloud infrastructure.  [6]

randomly 

Load  arrives 

in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  and  can  choke  the  server’s  bandwidth  by 
overloading  some  nodes  while  its  other  nodes  are  idle. 
This  problem  persists  and  grows  with  the  increasing 
customer base in the cloud. The solution to  this problem 
may  be  equal  distribution  of  work  load  among  all  the 
nodes  in  the  cloud  by  efficient  scheduling  and  resource 
allocation  thereby  improving  the  overall  performance  of 
the  system,  reducing  the  response  time  and  total  cost  of 
the system.

LOAD BALANCING 

 

Load  balancing  is  a  general  method  to  suitably 
distribute  work  load  across  multiple  customer  networks.  
With  all  the  storage  and  application  services  getting 
virtual  load  balancing  aims  to  be  self  adaptive  and 
organize  cloud  services  to  the  increasing  computing 
traffic  and load  so  as  to  achieve  maximum  utilization  of 
resources by deputing the load to each resource and node 
equally.    Load  balancing algorithms are  optimized  if  the 
resources are utilized efficiently.  

     This method if applied accurately helps to improve 
the  efficiency  of  the  entire  network  by  reducing  the 
response  time  and  optimizing  the  resource  utilization. 
One of the most critical issues faced by Cloud computing 
is  Load  Balancing.  With  the  no.  of  users  increasing  and 
the  storage  and  other  services  to  be  provided  to  this 
growing  lot,  cloud  computing  is  facing  an  issue  of 
allocating and completing the job. Some nodes have been 
overloaded  while  others  are  idle.  There  has  to  be  a 
mechanism  that  understands  the  flow  of  jobs  being 
received and the current status of each node to assign the 
jobs  accordingly  to  the  cloud  nodes.  Load  Balancing 
helps to distribute the jobs uniformly across the nodes of

the  cloud,  hence  improving  the  overall  efficiency  of  the 
cloud. [5] 

it,  hence 

increasing 

idle  or  overloading 

     Every  node  is  assigned  a  job  without  keeping  any 
node 
the 
throughput of the cloud. Load balancing can be classified 
basis  on  how  the  received  jobs  are  delegated  to  nodes 
(Static  Load  Balancing)  OR  on  the  status  of  the  other 
nodes/total  system  (Dynamic  Load  Balancing).  Most  of 
the 
load  balancing  algorithms  are  strategized  and 
developed following these two concepts.  [9]

     In  Load  Balancing,  traffic  in  the  cloud  is  diverted 
and  data  is  received  or  sent  without  bottlenecks  and 
delays.  The jobs may be  prioritized and then sent to the 
nodes for processing.  The nodes are equally loaded with 
work  or  are  selected  depending  on  their  workload  status 
or availability. Mapping resources to the nodes is not easy 
as  the  cloud  is  under  constant  change.  Load  balancing 
model  divides  the  cloud  in  several  cloud  partitions  and 
directs the user’s request despite his location to the right 
resource  rather  than  choking  a  single  node  with  all  job 
requests to process.  The figure below –

overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  With  the  growing 
demand, there is an ever growing user base with each user

LOAD BALANCING 

 

Load  balancing  is  a  general  method  to  suitably 
distribute  work  load  across  multiple  customer  networks.  
With  all  the  storage  and  application  services  getting 
virtual  load  balancing  aims  to  be  self  adaptive  and 
organize  cloud  services  to  the  increasing  computing 
traffic  and load  so  as  to  achieve  maximum  utilization  of 
resources by deputing the load to each resource and node 
equally.    Load  balancing algorithms are  optimized  if  the 
resources are utilized efficiently.  

     This method if applied accurately helps to improve 
the  efficiency  of  the  entire  network  by  reducing  the 
response  time  and  optimizing  the  resource  utilization. 
One of the most critical issues faced by Cloud computing 
is  Load  Balancing.  With  the  no.  of  users  increasing  and 
the  storage  and  other  services  to  be  provided  to  this 
growing  lot,  cloud  computing  is  facing  an  issue  of 
allocating and completing the job. Some nodes have been 
overloaded  while  others  are  idle.  There  has  to  be  a 
mechanism  that  understands  the  flow  of  jobs  being 
received and the current status of each node to assign the 
jobs  accordingly  to  the  cloud  nodes.  Load  Balancing 
helps to distribute the jobs uniformly across the nodes of

     Every  node  is  assigned  a  job  without  keeping  any 
node 
the 
throughput of the cloud. Load balancing can be classified 
basis  on  how  the  received  jobs  are  delegated  to  nodes 
(Static  Load  Balancing)  OR  on  the  status  of  the  other 
nodes/total  system  (Dynamic  Load  Balancing).  Most  of 
the 
load  balancing  algorithms  are  strategized  and 
developed following these two concepts.  [9]

     In  Load  Balancing,  traffic  in  the  cloud  is  diverted 
and  data  is  received  or  sent  without  bottlenecks  and 
delays.  The jobs may be  prioritized and then sent to the 
nodes for processing.  The nodes are equally loaded with 
work  or  are  selected  depending  on  their  workload  status 
or availability. Mapping resources to the nodes is not easy 
as  the  cloud  is  under  constant  change.  Load  balancing 
model  divides  the  cloud  in  several  cloud  partitions  and 
directs the user’s request despite his location to the right 
resource  rather  than  choking  a  single  node  with  all  job 
requests to process.  The figure below –

to follow and achieve the desired result. Rather there are 
several methods and each method has its own advantages 
and  disadvantages.  Provisioning  of  services  must 
coordinate  completion  time  of  these  tasks  providing  a 
unified response to the users. There are many algorithms 
associated with load balancing in cloud computing. Some 
of  them  are  explained  and  compared  in  the  coming 
section.  

     Some concerns associated with load balancing to be 
kept  in  mind  when  strategizing  and  building  a  load 
balancing algorithm are: 

     As  cloud  computing 

is  elastic,  resources  are 
allocated automatically. It is important to detect the right 
use or release of these resources in the cloud to keep the 
performance of the cloud intact. 

     Virtual  machines  are  moved  between  physical 
machines  to  unload  a  heavily  loaded  physical  machine. 
The  distribution  of  load  when  the  virtual  machine  is 
moving has to be rightly sensed to avoid bottle necks. 

     The  entire  concept  of  cloud  computing  is  based  on 
the  idea  to  have  lesser  individual  resources.  Rather,  it 
endorses 
to  have  global  resources  owned  by  few 
providers and open for public utility. The accurate use of 
these  data  centres  is  important  for  effective  use  of  load 
balancing. 

     Management  and  Distribution  of  data  to  the  cloud 
for  optimal  storage  of  data  while  maintaining  the  fast 
access and processing of jobs is crucial. 

     Small data centres may be more beneficial in terms 
of cost and energy consumption as compared to large data 
centres.  Cloud  computing  being  on  a  global  scale  may 
find  it  difficult  to  ensure  adequate  response  time  with 
optimal distribution of resources.  [5] 

 

2.1 Load Balancing Algorithms 

 

Load  Balancing  algorithms  are  used  to  improve  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  Load  balancing  or  job 
allocation  is  the  main  research  concepts  for  resource 
management. 
its 
executing  flow  are  some  major  factors  that  decide  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of an algorithm.  

  Cost,  scalability,  flexibility  and 

     The  centralized  approach  has  a  single  point  of 
success or failure as all information is in custody of only 
a  single  node  and  all  jobs  are  allocated  by  this  node 
simply. Decentralized system being more robust than the 
centralized  approach  delivers  only  partial  information  to 
its  nodes  to  help  them  reach  a  sub  optimal  decision.  
Depending  on  the  stage  of  the  system  at  which  load 
balancing  would  be  implemented,  the  load  balancing 
algorithms can be classified as static or dynamic. 

     Static Load Balancing algorithms assign work to the 
nodes  as  and  when  the  job  arrives  to  the  cloud.  Hence 
some  job  is  assigned  to  each node  but  the  job  cannot  be 
shifted during execution. In this stage, the information of 
the entire system is known and the strategy for balancing 
the load is made during the compilation time. Though the 
jobs are distributed equally to each node, users may still 
have  a  long  waiting  time  while  other  jobs  are  being 
processed, keeping the users dissatisfied. 

Volume 3 Issue 4, April 2014                                 

 

     On  the  contrary,  dynamic load  balancing  algorithm 
is  implemented  at  the  run  time  and  strategies  for 
balancing  load  change  depending  on  the real  time  status 
of the system. [6] Dynamic Load Balancing examines the 
current  state  of  the  system  and  shifts  jobs  accordingly 
from  an  overloaded  machine  to  an  idle  or  a  normal 
machine  to  improve  the  execution  speed,  involving 
participation  of  all  the  nodes.    These  nodes  may  work 
collaboratively  or  independently  towards  reducing  the 
response  time  or  increasing  the  overall  efficiency  of  the 
cloud.  For  a  small  size  system,  non  distributed  load 
balancing algorithm can be applied where a single node in 
the system or in each cluster of nodes is allocated to take 
care  of  load  balancing.   Dynamic algorithms have  better 
adaptability  but  are  sensitive  to  the  accuracy  of  the  load 
information  or  the  real  time  statement  of  the  system, 
thereby  causing  mistakes  while  allotting  the  jobs.  The 
processors  or  nodes  are 
in  a  non 
cooperative  game  as  the  users  are  given  the  priority  of 
choosing  their  job  allocation  strategies  serving  their 
selfish interests.  

treated  unfair 

     Hybrid Load Balancing algorithms provide solution 
to the issues faced  by the static and dynamic algorithms. 
A  game  theoretic  load  balancing  algorithm  is  one  such 
approach  towards  allocating  the  right  job  to  the  right 
resource in the cloud. 

     There  are  several 

load  balancing  algorithms 
structured  to  address  the  load  balancing  issues  in  cloud 
computing. Some of the Load Balancing algorithms used 
in Cloud Computing are as described below: 

 
Round  Robin  –  It  is  a  random  sampling  algorithm 
wherein  jobs  are  assigned  to  nodes  in  a  round  robin 
circular  order.  Each  node  is  distributed  equal  work  but 
since  the  processing  time  of  each  job  is  not  the  same  it 
results in under loading and over loading of nodes. 

 
Equally Spread Current Execution (ECSE)  – A spread 
spectrum  technique  handles  the  jobs  with  priorities.  It 
analyzes the job’s size and allocates it to the node which 
is  comparatively  idle  or  can  handle  the  task  easily  in 
lesser time. 

 
Throttled  Load  Balancing  –  it  is  a  sender  initiated 
request where the user requests the load balancer to check 
its  job  and  assign  the  appropriate  virtual  machine  to 
perform its job with maximum throughput.  

 
Task Scheduling Algorithm – two level task scheduling 
is  executed  to  meet  user’s  requirements  and  improving 
the  resource  utilization.  It  maps  the  jobs  to  the  virtual 
machines  in  the  cloud  and  then  maps  these  virtual 
machines to the host resources.  

 

 
Load Balancing Ant Colony Optimization (LBACO) – 
This  is  based  on  Genetic  theory.  Ants  travel  through 
various  routes  to  find  food.  They  leave  behind  trails  of 
their  path  by  depositing  pheromone  for  other  ants  and 
finally find the shortest path to travel to their destination.  
[10] This is a method to construct solutions based on the 
characteristics  of  the  past  solutions.  This  algorithm  is

system implementation from the users and creates virtual

LOAD BALANCING 

 

Load  balancing  is  a  general  method  to  suitably 
distribute  work  load  across  multiple  customer  networks.  
With  all  the  storage  and  application  services  getting 
virtual  load  balancing  aims  to  be  self  adaptive  and 
organize  cloud  services  to  the  increasing  computing 
traffic  and load  so  as  to  achieve  maximum  utilization  of 
resources by deputing the load to each resource and node 
equally.    Load  balancing algorithms are  optimized  if  the 
resources are utilized efficiently.  

     This method if applied accurately helps to improve 
the  efficiency  of  the  entire  network  by  reducing  the 
response  time  and  optimizing  the  resource  utilization. 
One of the most critical issues faced by Cloud computing 
is  Load  Balancing.  With  the  no.  of  users  increasing  and 
the  storage  and  other  services  to  be  provided  to  this 
growing  lot,  cloud  computing  is  facing  an  issue  of 
allocating and completing the job. Some nodes have been 
overloaded  while  others  are  idle.  There  has  to  be  a 
mechanism  that  understands  the  flow  of  jobs  being 
received and the current status of each node to assign the 
jobs  accordingly  to  the  cloud  nodes.  Load  Balancing 
helps to distribute the jobs uniformly across the nodes of

     Every  node  is  assigned  a  job  without  keeping  any 
node 
the 
throughput of the cloud. Load balancing can be classified 
basis  on  how  the  received  jobs  are  delegated  to  nodes 
(Static  Load  Balancing)  OR  on  the  status  of  the  other 
nodes/total  system  (Dynamic  Load  Balancing).  Most  of 
the 
load  balancing  algorithms  are  strategized  and 
developed following these two concepts.  [9]

     In  Load  Balancing,  traffic  in  the  cloud  is  diverted 
and  data  is  received  or  sent  without  bottlenecks  and 
delays.  The jobs may be  prioritized and then sent to the 
nodes for processing.  The nodes are equally loaded with 
work  or  are  selected  depending  on  their  workload  status 
or availability. Mapping resources to the nodes is not easy 
as  the  cloud  is  under  constant  change.  Load  balancing 
model  divides  the  cloud  in  several  cloud  partitions  and 
directs the user’s request despite his location to the right 
resource  rather  than  choking  a  single  node  with  all  job 
requests to process.  The figure below –

to follow and achieve the desired result. Rather there are 
several methods and each method has its own advantages 
and  disadvantages.  Provisioning  of  services  must 
coordinate  completion  time  of  these  tasks  providing  a 
unified response to the users. There are many algorithms 
associated with load balancing in cloud computing. Some 
of  them  are  explained  and  compared  in  the  coming 
section.  

     Some concerns associated with load balancing to be 
kept  in  mind  when  strategizing  and  building  a  load 
balancing algorithm are: 

     As  cloud  computing 

is  elastic,  resources  are 
allocated automatically. It is important to detect the right 
use or release of these resources in the cloud to keep the 
performance of the cloud intact. 

     Virtual  machines  are  moved  between  physical 
machines  to  unload  a  heavily  loaded  physical  machine. 
The  distribution  of  load  when  the  virtual  machine  is 
moving has to be rightly sensed to avoid bottle necks. 

     The  entire  concept  of  cloud  computing  is  based  on 
the  idea  to  have  lesser  individual  resources.  Rather,  it 
endorses 
to  have  global  resources  owned  by  few 
providers and open for public utility. The accurate use of 
these  data  centres  is  important  for  effective  use  of  load 
balancing. 

     Management  and  Distribution  of  data  to  the  cloud 
for  optimal  storage  of  data  while  maintaining  the  fast 
access and processing of jobs is crucial. 

     Small data centres may be more beneficial in terms 
of cost and energy consumption as compared to large data 
centres.  Cloud  computing  being  on  a  global  scale  may 
find  it  difficult  to  ensure  adequate  response  time  with 
optimal distribution of resources.  [5] 

 

2.1 Load Balancing Algorithms 

 

Load  Balancing  algorithms  are  used  to  improve  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  Load  balancing  or  job 
allocation  is  the  main  research  concepts  for  resource 
management. 
its 
executing  flow  are  some  major  factors  that  decide  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of an algorithm.  

  Cost,  scalability,  flexibility  and 

     The  centralized  approach  has  a  single  point  of 
success or failure as all information is in custody of only 
a  single  node  and  all  jobs  are  allocated  by  this  node 
simply. Decentralized system being more robust than the 
centralized  approach  delivers  only  partial  information  to 
its  nodes  to  help  them  reach  a  sub  optimal  decision.  
Depending  on  the  stage  of  the  system  at  which  load 
balancing  would  be  implemented,  the  load  balancing 
algorithms can be classified as static or dynamic. 

     Static Load Balancing algorithms assign work to the 
nodes  as  and  when  the  job  arrives  to  the  cloud.  Hence 
some  job  is  assigned  to  each node  but  the  job  cannot  be 
shifted during execution. In this stage, the information of 
the entire system is known and the strategy for balancing 
the load is made during the compilation time. Though the 
jobs are distributed equally to each node, users may still 
have  a  long  waiting  time  while  other  jobs  are  being 
processed, keeping the users dissatisfied. 

Volume 3 Issue 4, April 2014                                 

 

     On  the  contrary,  dynamic load  balancing  algorithm 
is  implemented  at  the  run  time  and  strategies  for 
balancing  load  change  depending  on  the real  time  status 
of the system. [6] Dynamic Load Balancing examines the 
current  state  of  the  system  and  shifts  jobs  accordingly 
from  an  overloaded  machine  to  an  idle  or  a  normal 
machine  to  improve  the  execution  speed,  involving 
participation  of  all  the  nodes.    These  nodes  may  work 
collaboratively  or  independently  towards  reducing  the 
response  time  or  increasing  the  overall  efficiency  of  the 
cloud.  For  a  small  size  system,  non  distributed  load 
balancing algorithm can be applied where a single node in 
the system or in each cluster of nodes is allocated to take 
care  of  load  balancing.   Dynamic algorithms have  better 
adaptability  but  are  sensitive  to  the  accuracy  of  the  load 
information  or  the  real  time  statement  of  the  system, 
thereby  causing  mistakes  while  allotting  the  jobs.  The 
processors  or  nodes  are 
in  a  non 
cooperative  game  as  the  users  are  given  the  priority  of 
choosing  their  job  allocation  strategies  serving  their 
selfish interests.  

treated  unfair 

     Hybrid Load Balancing algorithms provide solution 
to the issues faced  by the static and dynamic algorithms. 
A  game  theoretic  load  balancing  algorithm  is  one  such 
approach  towards  allocating  the  right  job  to  the  right 
resource in the cloud. 

     There  are  several 

load  balancing  algorithms 
structured  to  address  the  load  balancing  issues  in  cloud 
computing. Some of the Load Balancing algorithms used 
in Cloud Computing are as described below: 

 
Round  Robin  –  It  is  a  random  sampling  algorithm 
wherein  jobs  are  assigned  to  nodes  in  a  round  robin 
circular  order.  Each  node  is  distributed  equal  work  but 
since  the  processing  time  of  each  job  is  not  the  same  it 
results in under loading and over loading of nodes. 

 
Equally Spread Current Execution (ECSE)  – A spread 
spectrum  technique  handles  the  jobs  with  priorities.  It 
analyzes the job’s size and allocates it to the node which 
is  comparatively  idle  or  can  handle  the  task  easily  in 
lesser time. 

 
Throttled  Load  Balancing  –  it  is  a  sender  initiated 
request where the user requests the load balancer to check 
its  job  and  assign  the  appropriate  virtual  machine  to 
perform its job with maximum throughput.  

 
Task Scheduling Algorithm – two level task scheduling 
is  executed  to  meet  user’s  requirements  and  improving 
the  resource  utilization.  It  maps  the  jobs  to  the  virtual 
machines  in  the  cloud  and  then  maps  these  virtual 
machines to the host resources.  

 

 
Load Balancing Ant Colony Optimization (LBACO) – 
This  is  based  on  Genetic  theory.  Ants  travel  through 
various  routes  to  find  food.  They  leave  behind  trails  of 
their  path  by  depositing  pheromone  for  other  ants  and 
finally find the shortest path to travel to their destination.  
[10] This is a method to construct solutions based on the 
characteristics  of  the  past  solutions.  This  algorithm  is

optimizing the resources in minimum response time. [13]. 
Tree and star networking systems are examples of Global 
approach. 

Load Balancing effects cloud computing and improves 
the  performance  by  redistributing  the  load  among  the 
processors. Jobs are transferred from one node to another 
through the network involving some delay (queuing delay 
+processing  delay)  as  it has to  determine  the  destination 
node through remote processing. [11] 

     A distributed system model has n no. of users and m 
no  of  computing  resources.  Nash  Equilibrium  can  be 
defined  for  a  distributed  system  model  as  a  strategy  “s” 
for every user “u” as

its  average  expected 

The  Nash  equilibrium  is  achieved  when  no  user  can 
decrease 
time  by 
unilaterally  changing  its  strategy.  A  cloud  which  has  a 
normal  rate  should  dispatch  jobs  immediately  when  he 
receives  to  the  nodes  that  would  process  them.    These 
processors maintain a waiting queue therefore, the

     Having learnt the different ways the players can turn 
the  game  in  a  system,  one  of  the  issues  that  the  system 
might face is in deciding the period it is to be  refreshed. 
The refresh period cannot be too long or too short or else 
it would invite the inconsistency problem with erroneous 
load strategy and mistaken nodes choice. If it is long, the 
information  may  get  obsolete  and  the  system  would  not 
be able to make the right decision. Likewise, if the period 
is short, the frequency  would be very high impacting the 
performance of cloud computing. The refresh period also 
has  to  be  accurately  planned  to  avoid  inconsistency  and 
errors.

 

used for mobile networks. 
 

2.2 Game Theory approach for Load Balancing   

 

 This  algorithm  like  LBACO  is  also  based  on  Genetic 
behaviour  and  is  inspired  by  human  networking  where 
local  information  at  each  node  is  utilized  for  the 
distribution of jobs. Load balancing in cloud computing is 
viewed  as  a  game  with  the nodes  and  jobs  as  players  in 
the  game.  The  main  intention  is  to  overcome  the  load 
balancing  problem  by  using  Game  Theory.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  is  an  improvised  strategy  for  load 
balancing  through  efficient  job  scheduling  and  resource 
allocation  techniques.  All  nodes  should  be  processing 
equal  amount  of  work  at  any  time  basis  the  size, 
processing time and importance of the job.  

     Motivation  for  Game  theory  approach  for  Load 

Balancing in Cloud Computing 

Given that there is large no. of jobs in the cloud; Load 
Balancing  formulates  the  allocation  of  these  jobs  to 
computing  resources  optimizing  the  resource  utilization 
and response time. Every user has a different requirement   
and  selfishly  wants  all  the  resources  available  for  them 
while the computing resource has to substantially meet all 
these  requirements.  This  selfish  behaviour  in  the  cloud 
cannot  be  overcome  using  conventional  algorithms  for 
load balancing.  

     For  static  load  balancing,  a  cooperative  game  is 
modelled  taking  into  account  the  collected  system 
information.  The  decision  makers  cooperate  in  making 
decisions  to  reach  an  optimal  solution  which  is  in 
concurrence  and  agreement  with  all  players.  The  load 
balancing  problem  is  formulated  as  a  cooperative  game 
among 
the 
communication  networking  subsystem.  Nash  Bargaining 
Solution (NBS) provides the Pareto Optimal solution for 
cooperative load balancing game.  [11] 

heterogeneous 

“n” 

computers 

and 

     For dynamic or non cooperative games, the current 
state  of  the  system  is  taken  into  account  along  with  the 
static  load  balancing  scheme  to  try  and  reach  the  Nash 
Equilibrium. Since there are several interactions involved, 
each player has a strategy as the best response to the other 
player’s  strategy.  Nash  equilibrium  is  attained  based  on 
these  choices  of  strategies.  Each  player  makes  the  most 
optimized decision for himself and the optimal solution is 
achieved  when  no  player  can  benefit  by  changing  his 
decision. It is referred as Wardrop equilibrium when there 
are  infinite  no.  of  decision  makers,  whereas  Nash 
equilibrium  is  obtained  for  finite  no  of  decision  makers. 
The  expected  response  time  majorly  remains  low  and 
may  increase  when  the  system  utilization  is  very  high. 
[12] 

     A global approach to the game is when there is one 
decision  maker  supervising  all  the  jobs  and  status  of 
nodes  and 
is  responsible  for 

that  decision  maker

     Cloud Computing has some interesting  characteristics 
provisioned by the user to his best interest. Some of them 
are listed below: 
     Abstraction  and  virtualization  are  the  fundamental 
concepts  of  cloud  computing.  It  abstracts  the  details  of 
system implementation from the users and creates virtual 
platforms to map the workloads to the nodes in the cloud. 
[4] 
     Computing  applications  can  be  set  as  per  the  user’s 
requirement  so  as  to  provide  the  computing  services 
automatically. 
     Cloud  computing  is  a  broad  network  and  capabilities 
provided  on 
through  standard 
mechanisms. 
     Several  physical  and  virtual  resources  serve  multiple 
users across several locations. These resources expand or 
contract their availability depending on the demand of the 
users.  Resources  may  be  memory,  storage,  bandwidth 
etc.,  
     Cloud  Computing  is  transparent  as  its  usage  can  be 
monitored and controlled. The cloud usage and operation 
can be controlled and accordingly optimizes its resources 
by supplementing the service to the cloud. [5] 
     A cloud can be public or private and may be shared by 
several or selected users. It can also be a combination of 
the two referred to  as a Hybrid cloud.  The public cloud 
may be partitioned based on the geographical locations to 
manage  the  unlimited  service  calls.    Resources  are 
globally  distributed  and  have  varying  capacity  to  be 
hosted  across 
the  cloud.  The  cloud  computing 
environment  is  large,  complex  and  dynamic  integrating 
numerous computing resources.  
 
 

Abstract:  Cloud  Computing  is  a  mechanism  that  offers 
several  services  such  as  public  storage,  application, 
hardware,  software,  processing  etc.,  to  a  shared  pool  of 
users.  Still  being  in  its  nascent  stage  and  with  ever 
increasing  customer  base  and  amount  of  data  to  store; 
proper  access  control,  data  lineage,  cost  and  stability  are 
still  some  issues in  Cloud  Computing,  with  Load  Balancing 
being  the  biggest  challenge.  This  article  compares  the 
various  algorithms  associated  with  load  balancing  in  cloud 
computing  and  explains  the  application  of  game  theory 
assuming  the  nodes  and  jobs  in  the  cloud  as  players  of  the 
game. Game theory when associated with load balancing can 
help improve the efficiency of cloud computing by reducing 
the response time and utilizing the resources optimally.

INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing 
is  a  service  delivery  framework 
allowing users to share resources. Hardware, software or 
application  service  can  be  enabled  on  demand  of  the 
consumers.  Cloud  Computing  adjusts  to  the  changing 
demands of the users and also spares them from investing 
huge  amounts  in  purchasing  of  hardware,  software  or 
even in infrastructure. [1] Cloud computing services offer 
the  pay-as-you-use  model,  hence  it  is  a  cost  effective 
model making IT management much responsive and user 
friendly  to  the  changing  needs.    [2]    Cloud  computing 
infrastructure  overcomes  the  physical  barriers  in  the 
system  and  automats  the  management  of  the  resources 
providing  users  in  the  cloud  with  the  computational 
services  and  data  storage  facilities.  The  user  base  can 
range from an individual to infinity.  [3]

I.2 Challenges in Cloud Computing 
 

Though  cloud  computing  is  a  brilliant  concept  of 
sharing  work  load  but  has  certain  challenges  associated 
with it.  The users may not be able to evenly assign their 
control over the data or application available at the cloud 
cluster.  Availability  and  usage  of  resource  affects  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  With  the  growing 
demand, there is an ever growing user base with each user 
expecting unlimited availability  of resource  or service in 
the  cloud  for  him.  Cloud  computing  has  to  meet  the 
expectations of all these users efficiently. Since data and 
disseminated 
the  open 
environment, data storage increases and becomes an issue 
in  handling  the  users  and  their  jobs  in  the  cloud. 
Maintaining the load information in this vast system and 
dispersing it to the right resource involves hefty cost.  As 
cloud  based  services  become  more  numerous  and 
dynamic, 
becomes  more

 Security,  stability,  work 

load  balance,  network 
bandwidth,  response  time,  transfer  delay,  data  transfer 
cost  etc  are  some  of  issues  in  Cloud  Computing  with 
Load Balancing being one of the major challenges. 

     The cyber (servers, routers) and physical (fibre etc.,) 
components account for initial provisioning and operation 
of  the  cloud  and  are  also  prone  to  attacks.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  allows  provisioning  and  operation  of 
the cloud infrastructure.  [6]

LOAD BALANCING 

 

Load  balancing  is  a  general  method  to  suitably 
distribute  work  load  across  multiple  customer  networks.  
With  all  the  storage  and  application  services  getting 
virtual  load  balancing  aims  to  be  self  adaptive  and 
organize  cloud  services  to  the  increasing  computing 
traffic  and load  so  as  to  achieve  maximum  utilization  of 
resources by deputing the load to each resource and node 
equally.    Load  balancing algorithms are  optimized  if  the 
resources are utilized efficiently.  

     This method if applied accurately helps to improve 
the  efficiency  of  the  entire  network  by  reducing  the 
response  time  and  optimizing  the  resource  utilization. 
One of the most critical issues faced by Cloud computing 
is  Load  Balancing.  With  the  no.  of  users  increasing  and 
the  storage  and  other  services  to  be  provided  to  this 
growing  lot,  cloud  computing  is  facing  an  issue  of 
allocating and completing the job. Some nodes have been 
overloaded  while  others  are  idle.  There  has  to  be  a 
mechanism  that  understands  the  flow  of  jobs  being 
received and the current status of each node to assign the 
jobs  accordingly  to  the  cloud  nodes.  Load  Balancing 
helps to distribute the jobs uniformly across the nodes of

     Every  node  is  assigned  a  job  without  keeping  any

throughput of the cloud. Load balancing can be classified 
basis  on  how  the  received  jobs  are  delegated  to  nodes 
(Static  Load  Balancing)  OR  on  the  status  of  the  other 
nodes/total  system  (Dynamic  Load  Balancing).  Most  of 
the 
load  balancing  algorithms  are  strategized  and 
developed following these two concepts.  [9]

     In  Load  Balancing,  traffic  in  the  cloud  is  diverted 
and  data  is  received  or  sent  without  bottlenecks  and 
delays.  The jobs may be  prioritized and then sent to the 
nodes for processing.  The nodes are equally loaded with 
work  or  are  selected  depending  on  their  workload  status 
or availability. Mapping resources to the nodes is not easy 
as  the  cloud  is  under  constant  change.  Load  balancing 
model  divides  the  cloud  in  several  cloud  partitions  and 
directs the user’s request despite his location to the right 
resource  rather  than  choking  a  single  node  with  all  job 
requests to process.  The figure below –

to follow and achieve the desired result. Rather there are 
several methods and each method has its own advantages 
and  disadvantages.  Provisioning  of  services  must 
coordinate  completion  time  of  these  tasks  providing  a 
unified response to the users. There are many algorithms 
associated with load balancing in cloud computing. Some 
of  them  are  explained  and  compared  in  the  coming 
section.  

     Some concerns associated with load balancing to be 
kept  in  mind  when  strategizing  and  building  a  load 
balancing algorithm are: 

     As  cloud  computing 

is  elastic,  resources  are 
allocated automatically. It is important to detect the right 
use or release of these resources in the cloud to keep the 
performance of the cloud intact. 

     Virtual  machines  are  moved  between  physical 
machines  to  unload  a  heavily  loaded  physical  machine. 
The  distribution  of  load  when  the  virtual  machine  is 
moving has to be rightly sensed to avoid bottle necks. 

     The  entire  concept  of  cloud  computing  is  based  on 
the  idea  to  have  lesser  individual  resources.  Rather,  it 
endorses 
to  have  global  resources  owned  by  few 
providers and open for public utility. The accurate use of 
these  data  centres  is  important  for  effective  use  of  load 
balancing. 

     Management  and  Distribution  of  data  to  the  cloud 
for  optimal  storage  of  data  while  maintaining  the  fast 
access and processing of jobs is crucial. 

     Small data centres may be more beneficial in terms 
of cost and energy consumption as compared to large data 
centres.  Cloud  computing  being  on  a  global  scale  may 
find  it  difficult  to  ensure  adequate  response  time  with 
optimal distribution of resources.  [5] 

 

2.1 Load Balancing Algorithms 

 

Load  Balancing  algorithms  are  used  to  improve  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  Load  balancing  or  job 
allocation  is  the  main  research  concepts  for  resource 
management. 
its 
executing  flow  are  some  major  factors  that  decide  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of an algorithm.  

  Cost,  scalability,  flexibility  and 

     The  centralized  approach  has  a  single  point  of 
success or failure as all information is in custody of only 
a  single  node  and  all  jobs  are  allocated  by  this  node 
simply. Decentralized system being more robust than the 
centralized  approach  delivers  only  partial  information  to 
its  nodes  to  help  them  reach  a  sub  optimal  decision.  
Depending  on  the  stage  of  the  system  at  which  load 
balancing  would  be  implemented,  the  load  balancing 
algorithms can be classified as static or dynamic. 

     Static Load Balancing algorithms assign work to the 
nodes  as  and  when  the  job  arrives  to  the  cloud.  Hence 
some  job  is  assigned  to  each node  but  the  job  cannot  be 
shifted during execution. In this stage, the information of 
the entire system is known and the strategy for balancing 
the load is made during the compilation time. Though the 
jobs are distributed equally to each node, users may still 
have  a  long  waiting  time  while  other  jobs  are  being 
processed, keeping the users dissatisfied. 

Volume 3 Issue 4, April 2014                                 

 

     On  the  contrary,  dynamic load  balancing  algorithm 
is  implemented  at  the  run  time  and  strategies  for 
balancing  load  change  depending  on  the real  time  status 
of the system. [6] Dynamic Load Balancing examines the 
current  state  of  the  system  and  shifts  jobs  accordingly 
from  an  overloaded  machine  to  an  idle  or  a  normal 
machine  to  improve  the  execution  speed,  involving 
participation  of  all  the  nodes.    These  nodes  may  work 
collaboratively  or  independently  towards  reducing  the 
response  time  or  increasing  the  overall  efficiency  of  the 
cloud.  For  a  small  size  system,  non  distributed  load 
balancing algorithm can be applied where a single node in 
the system or in each cluster of nodes is allocated to take 
care  of  load  balancing.   Dynamic algorithms have  better 
adaptability  but  are  sensitive  to  the  accuracy  of  the  load 
information  or  the  real  time  statement  of  the  system, 
thereby  causing  mistakes  while  allotting  the  jobs.  The 
processors  or  nodes  are 
in  a  non 
cooperative  game  as  the  users  are  given  the  priority  of 
choosing  their  job  allocation  strategies  serving  their 
selfish interests.  

treated  unfair 

     Hybrid Load Balancing algorithms provide solution 
to the issues faced  by the static and dynamic algorithms. 
A  game  theoretic  load  balancing  algorithm  is  one  such 
approach  towards  allocating  the  right  job  to  the  right 
resource in the cloud. 

     There  are  several 

load  balancing  algorithms 
structured  to  address  the  load  balancing  issues  in  cloud 
computing. Some of the Load Balancing algorithms used 
in Cloud Computing are as described below: 

 
Round  Robin  –  It  is  a  random  sampling  algorithm 
wherein  jobs  are  assigned  to  nodes  in  a  round  robin 
circular  order.  Each  node  is  distributed  equal  work  but 
since  the  processing  time  of  each  job  is  not  the  same  it 
results in under loading and over loading of nodes. 

 
Equally Spread Current Execution (ECSE)  – A spread 
spectrum  technique  handles  the  jobs  with  priorities.  It 
analyzes the job’s size and allocates it to the node which 
is  comparatively  idle  or  can  handle  the  task  easily  in 
lesser time. 

 
Throttled  Load  Balancing  –  it  is  a  sender  initiated 
request where the user requests the load balancer to check 
its  job  and  assign  the  appropriate  virtual  machine  to 
perform its job with maximum throughput.  

 
Task Scheduling Algorithm – two level task scheduling 
is  executed  to  meet  user’s  requirements  and  improving 
the  resource  utilization.  It  maps  the  jobs  to  the  virtual 
machines  in  the  cloud  and  then  maps  these  virtual 
machines to the host resources.  

 

 
Load Balancing Ant Colony Optimization (LBACO) – 
This  is  based  on  Genetic  theory.  Ants  travel  through 
various  routes  to  find  food.  They  leave  behind  trails  of 
their  path  by  depositing  pheromone  for  other  ants  and 
finally find the shortest path to travel to their destination.  
[10] This is a method to construct solutions based on the 
characteristics  of  the  past  solutions.  This  algorithm  is

optimizing the resources in minimum response time. [13]. 
Tree and star networking systems are examples of Global 
approach. 

Load Balancing effects cloud computing and improves 
the  performance  by  redistributing  the  load  among  the 
processors. Jobs are transferred from one node to another 
through the network involving some delay (queuing delay 
+processing  delay)  as  it has to  determine  the  destination 
node through remote processing. [11] 

     A distributed system model has n no. of users and m 
no  of  computing  resources.  Nash  Equilibrium  can  be 
defined  for  a  distributed  system  model  as  a  strategy  “s” 
for every user “u” as

The  Nash  equilibrium  is  achieved  when  no  user  can 
decrease 
time  by 
unilaterally  changing  its  strategy.  A  cloud  which  has  a 
normal  rate  should  dispatch  jobs  immediately  when  he 
receives  to  the  nodes  that  would  process  them.    These 
processors maintain a waiting queue therefore, the

     Having learnt the different ways the players can turn 
the  game  in  a  system,  one  of  the  issues  that  the  system 
might face is in deciding the period it is to be  refreshed. 
The refresh period cannot be too long or too short or else 
it would invite the inconsistency problem with erroneous 
load strategy and mistaken nodes choice. If it is long, the 
information  may  get  obsolete  and  the  system  would  not 
be able to make the right decision. Likewise, if the period 
is short, the frequency  would be very high impacting the 
performance of cloud computing. The refresh period also 
has  to  be  accurately  planned  to  avoid  inconsistency  and 
errors.

 

used for mobile networks. 
 

2.2 Game Theory approach for Load Balancing   

 

 This  algorithm  like  LBACO  is  also  based  on  Genetic 
behaviour  and  is  inspired  by  human  networking  where 
local  information  at  each  node  is  utilized  for  the 
distribution of jobs. Load balancing in cloud computing is 
viewed  as  a  game  with  the nodes  and  jobs  as  players  in 
the  game.  The  main  intention  is  to  overcome  the  load 
balancing  problem  by  using  Game  Theory.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  is  an  improvised  strategy  for  load 
balancing  through  efficient  job  scheduling  and  resource 
allocation  techniques.  All  nodes  should  be  processing 
equal  amount  of  work  at  any  time  basis  the  size, 
processing time and importance of the job.  

     Motivation  for  Game  theory  approach  for  Load 

Balancing in Cloud Computing 

Given that there is large no. of jobs in the cloud; Load 
Balancing  formulates  the  allocation  of  these  jobs  to 
computing  resources  optimizing  the  resource  utilization 
and response time. Every user has a different requirement   
and  selfishly  wants  all  the  resources  available  for  them 
while the computing resource has to substantially meet all 
these  requirements.  This  selfish  behaviour  in  the  cloud 
cannot  be  overcome  using  conventional  algorithms  for 
load balancing.  

     For  static  load  balancing,  a  cooperative  game  is 
modelled  taking  into  account  the  collected  system 
information.  The  decision  makers  cooperate  in  making 
decisions  to  reach  an  optimal  solution  which  is  in 
concurrence  and  agreement  with  all  players.  The  load 
balancing  problem  is  formulated  as  a  cooperative  game 
among 
the 
communication  networking  subsystem.  Nash  Bargaining 
Solution (NBS) provides the Pareto Optimal solution for 
cooperative load balancing game.  [11] 

heterogeneous 

“n” 

computers 

and 

     For dynamic or non cooperative games, the current 
state  of  the  system  is  taken  into  account  along  with  the 
static  load  balancing  scheme  to  try  and  reach  the  Nash 
Equilibrium. Since there are several interactions involved, 
each player has a strategy as the best response to the other 
player’s  strategy.  Nash  equilibrium  is  attained  based  on 
these  choices  of  strategies.  Each  player  makes  the  most 
optimized decision for himself and the optimal solution is 
achieved  when  no  player  can  benefit  by  changing  his 
decision. It is referred as Wardrop equilibrium when there 
are  infinite  no.  of  decision  makers,  whereas  Nash 
equilibrium  is  obtained  for  finite  no  of  decision  makers. 
The  expected  response  time  majorly  remains  low  and 
may  increase  when  the  system  utilization  is  very  high. 
[12] 

     A global approach to the game is when there is one 
decision  maker  supervising  all  the  jobs  and  status  of 
nodes  and 
is  responsible  for 

that  decision  maker

Game theory is  a better approach in many aspects and  
involves low  cost for maintaining the structure. We look 
forward to creating a load balancing algorithm that works 
as a non cooperative game among users and a cooperative 
game  among  processors.  The  load  balancing  algorithm 
would  be  effective  if  the  average  job  arrival  rate  from 
users is less than the average processing rate of the jobs in 
the  cloud.  Therefore,  it is  important  to  correctly  allocate 
the  distribution  of  jobs  from  the  users  to  the  processors. 
This is possible if we can accurately determine the time a 
job  takes  to  travel  from  the  user  to  the  cloud  which  is 
dependent on the to the average size of the job, distance 
between  user  and  processor,  bandwidth  available  within 
the cloud etc., [6] 

    
The considered factors are briefed below: [14] 
 
Throughput  –  It  is  the  amount  of  work  that  all  the 

nodes can process in a given time period.  

Response time – the elapsed time between the demand 
placed  and  the  beginning  of  a  response  after  completion 
of the job. Simply put, it is the time taken to respond by a 
particular  load  balancing  algorithm.  This  parameter 
should be minimized.  

Scalability  –  Ability  of  a  computer  application 
(hardware/software/service) 
its  function 
effectively even when its size, topography etc is changed.  
Priority – Preference of tasks based on factors like cost, 

to  continue 

time, size etc.,. [15] 

Fault  tolerance  -  System  designed  such  that  it  can 

tolerate and continue functioning despite any failure.  

Overhead  –  refers  to  the  processing  time  required  by 

the system for installation, operation or any transaction. 

Power  Consumption  – 

Cost – it is the cost involved in configuring the system 
and in processing the jobs demanded by the users, better 
defined as the usage of the machine per hour. 
Information 

technology 
consumes  tremendous  power  and  involves  high  energy 
costs. Efficient power management is vital for the success 
of  IT  environment  such  as  Cloud  computing,  Grid 
computing etc.,  

Complexity – Making the entire system difficult. With 
increasing  users  associating  with  the  cloud  and  its 
properties, the complexity of the system increases.  

Fairness  –  indicates  that  each  user  has  the  equal 
response  time  and  all  get  their  jobs  completed  within 
approximately the same time. 

Performance – it is the speed and accuracy at which the

     Cloud Computing has some interesting  characteristics 
provisioned by the user to his best interest. Some of them 
are listed below: 
     Abstraction  and  virtualization  are  the  fundamental 
concepts  of  cloud  computing.  It  abstracts  the  details  of 
system implementation from the users and creates virtual 
platforms to map the workloads to the nodes in the cloud. 
[4] 
     Computing  applications  can  be  set  as  per  the  user’s 
requirement  so  as  to  provide  the  computing  services 
automatically. 
     Cloud  computing  is  a  broad  network  and  capabilities 
provided  on 
through  standard 
mechanisms. 
     Several  physical  and  virtual  resources  serve  multiple 
users across several locations. These resources expand or 
contract their availability depending on the demand of the 
users.  Resources  may  be  memory,  storage,  bandwidth 
etc.,  
     Cloud  Computing  is  transparent  as  its  usage  can  be 
monitored and controlled. The cloud usage and operation 
can be controlled and accordingly optimizes its resources 
by supplementing the service to the cloud. [5] 
     A cloud can be public or private and may be shared by 
several or selected users. It can also be a combination of 
the two referred to  as a Hybrid cloud.  The public cloud 
may be partitioned based on the geographical locations to 
manage  the  unlimited  service  calls.    Resources  are 
globally  distributed  and  have  varying  capacity  to  be 
hosted  across 
the  cloud.  The  cloud  computing 
environment  is  large,  complex  and  dynamic  integrating 
numerous computing resources.  
 
 

Abstract:  Cloud  Computing  is  a  mechanism  that  offers 
several  services  such  as  public  storage,  application, 
hardware,  software,  processing  etc.,  to  a  shared  pool  of 
users.  Still  being  in  its  nascent  stage  and  with  ever 
increasing  customer  base  and  amount  of  data  to  store; 
proper  access  control,  data  lineage,  cost  and  stability  are 
still  some  issues in  Cloud  Computing,  with  Load  Balancing 
being  the  biggest  challenge.  This  article  compares  the 
various  algorithms  associated  with  load  balancing  in  cloud 
computing  and  explains  the  application  of  game  theory 
assuming  the  nodes  and  jobs  in  the  cloud  as  players  of  the 
game. Game theory when associated with load balancing can 
help improve the efficiency of cloud computing by reducing 
the response time and utilizing the resources optimally.

allowing users to share resources. Hardware, software or 
application  service  can  be  enabled  on  demand  of  the 
consumers.  Cloud  Computing  adjusts  to  the  changing 
demands of the users and also spares them from investing 
huge  amounts  in  purchasing  of  hardware,  software  or 
even in infrastructure. [1] Cloud computing services offer 
the  pay-as-you-use  model,  hence  it  is  a  cost  effective 
model making IT management much responsive and user 
friendly  to  the  changing  needs.    [2]    Cloud  computing 
infrastructure  overcomes  the  physical  barriers  in  the 
system  and  automats  the  management  of  the  resources 
providing  users  in  the  cloud  with  the  computational 
services  and  data  storage  facilities.  The  user  base  can 
range from an individual to infinity.  [3]

I.2 Challenges in Cloud Computing 
 

Though  cloud  computing  is  a  brilliant  concept  of 
sharing  work  load  but  has  certain  challenges  associated 
with it.  The users may not be able to evenly assign their 
control over the data or application available at the cloud 
cluster.  Availability  and  usage  of  resource  affects  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  With  the  growing 
demand, there is an ever growing user base with each user 
expecting unlimited availability  of resource  or service in 
the  cloud  for  him.  Cloud  computing  has  to  meet  the 
expectations of all these users efficiently. Since data and 
disseminated 
the  open 
environment, data storage increases and becomes an issue 
in  handling  the  users  and  their  jobs  in  the  cloud. 
Maintaining the load information in this vast system and 
dispersing it to the right resource involves hefty cost.  As

components account for initial provisioning and operation 
of  the  cloud  and  are  also  prone  to  attacks.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  allows  provisioning  and  operation  of 
the cloud infrastructure.  [6]

LOAD BALANCING 

 

Load  balancing  is  a  general  method  to  suitably 
distribute  work  load  across  multiple  customer  networks.  
With  all  the  storage  and  application  services  getting 
virtual  load  balancing  aims  to  be  self  adaptive  and 
organize  cloud  services  to  the  increasing  computing 
traffic  and load  so  as  to  achieve  maximum  utilization  of 
resources by deputing the load to each resource and node 
equally.    Load  balancing algorithms are  optimized  if  the 
resources are utilized efficiently.  

     This method if applied accurately helps to improve 
the  efficiency  of  the  entire  network  by  reducing  the 
response  time  and  optimizing  the  resource  utilization. 
One of the most critical issues faced by Cloud computing 
is  Load  Balancing.  With  the  no.  of  users  increasing  and 
the  storage  and  other  services  to  be  provided  to  this 
growing  lot,  cloud  computing  is  facing  an  issue  of 
allocating and completing the job. Some nodes have been 
overloaded  while  others  are  idle.  There  has  to  be  a 
mechanism  that  understands  the  flow  of  jobs  being 
received and the current status of each node to assign the 
jobs  accordingly  to  the  cloud  nodes.  Load  Balancing 
helps to distribute the jobs uniformly across the nodes of

     Every  node  is  assigned  a  job  without  keeping  any

the 
throughput of the cloud. Load balancing can be classified 
basis  on  how  the  received  jobs  are  delegated  to  nodes 
(Static  Load  Balancing)  OR  on  the  status  of  the  other 
nodes/total  system  (Dynamic  Load  Balancing).  Most  of 
the 
load  balancing  algorithms  are  strategized  and 
developed following these two concepts.  [9]

     In  Load  Balancing,  traffic  in  the  cloud  is  diverted 
and  data  is  received  or  sent  without  bottlenecks  and 
delays.  The jobs may be  prioritized and then sent to the 
nodes for processing.  The nodes are equally loaded with 
work  or  are  selected  depending  on  their  workload  status 
or availability. Mapping resources to the nodes is not easy 
as  the  cloud  is  under  constant  change.  Load  balancing 
model  divides  the  cloud  in  several  cloud  partitions  and 
directs the user’s request despite his location to the right 
resource  rather  than  choking  a  single  node  with  all  job 
requests to process.  The figure below –

to follow and achieve the desired result. Rather there are 
several methods and each method has its own advantages 
and  disadvantages.  Provisioning  of  services  must 
coordinate  completion  time  of  these  tasks  providing  a 
unified response to the users. There are many algorithms 
associated with load balancing in cloud computing. Some 
of  them  are  explained  and  compared  in  the  coming 
section.  

     Some concerns associated with load balancing to be 
kept  in  mind  when  strategizing  and  building  a  load 
balancing algorithm are: 

     As  cloud  computing 

is  elastic,  resources  are 
allocated automatically. It is important to detect the right 
use or release of these resources in the cloud to keep the 
performance of the cloud intact. 

     Virtual  machines  are  moved  between  physical 
machines  to  unload  a  heavily  loaded  physical  machine. 
The  distribution  of  load  when  the  virtual  machine  is 
moving has to be rightly sensed to avoid bottle necks. 

     The  entire  concept  of  cloud  computing  is  based  on 
the  idea  to  have  lesser  individual  resources.  Rather,  it 
endorses 
to  have  global  resources  owned  by  few 
providers and open for public utility. The accurate use of 
these  data  centres  is  important  for  effective  use  of  load 
balancing. 

     Management  and  Distribution  of  data  to  the  cloud 
for  optimal  storage  of  data  while  maintaining  the  fast 
access and processing of jobs is crucial. 

     Small data centres may be more beneficial in terms 
of cost and energy consumption as compared to large data 
centres.  Cloud  computing  being  on  a  global  scale  may 
find  it  difficult  to  ensure  adequate  response  time  with 
optimal distribution of resources.  [5] 

 

2.1 Load Balancing Algorithms 

 

Load  Balancing  algorithms  are  used  to  improve  the 
overall  performance  of  the  cloud.  Load  balancing  or  job 
allocation  is  the  main  research  concepts  for  resource 
management. 
its 
executing  flow  are  some  major  factors  that  decide  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of an algorithm.  

  Cost,  scalability,  flexibility  and 

     The  centralized  approach  has  a  single  point  of 
success or failure as all information is in custody of only 
a  single  node  and  all  jobs  are  allocated  by  this  node 
simply. Decentralized system being more robust than the 
centralized  approach  delivers  only  partial  information  to 
its  nodes  to  help  them  reach  a  sub  optimal  decision.  
Depending  on  the  stage  of  the  system  at  which  load 
balancing  would  be  implemented,  the  load  balancing 
algorithms can be classified as static or dynamic. 

     Static Load Balancing algorithms assign work to the 
nodes  as  and  when  the  job  arrives  to  the  cloud.  Hence 
some  job  is  assigned  to  each node  but  the  job  cannot  be 
shifted during execution. In this stage, the information of 
the entire system is known and the strategy for balancing 
the load is made during the compilation time. Though the 
jobs are distributed equally to each node, users may still 
have  a  long  waiting  time  while  other  jobs  are  being 
processed, keeping the users dissatisfied. 

Volume 3 Issue 4, April 2014                                 

 

     On  the  contrary,  dynamic load  balancing  algorithm 
is  implemented  at  the  run  time  and  strategies  for 
balancing  load  change  depending  on  the real  time  status 
of the system. [6] Dynamic Load Balancing examines the 
current  state  of  the  system  and  shifts  jobs  accordingly 
from  an  overloaded  machine  to  an  idle  or  a  normal 
machine  to  improve  the  execution  speed,  involving 
participation  of  all  the  nodes.    These  nodes  may  work 
collaboratively  or  independently  towards  reducing  the 
response  time  or  increasing  the  overall  efficiency  of  the 
cloud.  For  a  small  size  system,  non  distributed  load 
balancing algorithm can be applied where a single node in 
the system or in each cluster of nodes is allocated to take 
care  of  load  balancing.   Dynamic algorithms have  better 
adaptability  but  are  sensitive  to  the  accuracy  of  the  load 
information  or  the  real  time  statement  of  the  system, 
thereby  causing  mistakes  while  allotting  the  jobs.  The 
processors  or  nodes  are 
in  a  non 
cooperative  game  as  the  users  are  given  the  priority  of 
choosing  their  job  allocation  strategies  serving  their 
selfish interests.  

treated  unfair 

     Hybrid Load Balancing algorithms provide solution 
to the issues faced  by the static and dynamic algorithms. 
A  game  theoretic  load  balancing  algorithm  is  one  such 
approach  towards  allocating  the  right  job  to  the  right 
resource in the cloud. 

     There  are  several 

load  balancing  algorithms 
structured  to  address  the  load  balancing  issues  in  cloud 
computing. Some of the Load Balancing algorithms used 
in Cloud Computing are as described below: 

 
Round  Robin  –  It  is  a  random  sampling  algorithm 
wherein  jobs  are  assigned  to  nodes  in  a  round  robin 
circular  order.  Each  node  is  distributed  equal  work  but 
since  the  processing  time  of  each  job  is  not  the  same  it 
results in under loading and over loading of nodes. 

 
Equally Spread Current Execution (ECSE)  – A spread 
spectrum  technique  handles  the  jobs  with  priorities.  It 
analyzes the job’s size and allocates it to the node which 
is  comparatively  idle  or  can  handle  the  task  easily  in 
lesser time. 

 
Throttled  Load  Balancing  –  it  is  a  sender  initiated 
request where the user requests the load balancer to check 
its  job  and  assign  the  appropriate  virtual  machine  to 
perform its job with maximum throughput.  

 
Task Scheduling Algorithm – two level task scheduling 
is  executed  to  meet  user’s  requirements  and  improving 
the  resource  utilization.  It  maps  the  jobs  to  the  virtual 
machines  in  the  cloud  and  then  maps  these  virtual 
machines to the host resources.  

 

 
Load Balancing Ant Colony Optimization (LBACO) – 
This  is  based  on  Genetic  theory.  Ants  travel  through 
various  routes  to  find  food.  They  leave  behind  trails  of 
their  path  by  depositing  pheromone  for  other  ants  and 
finally find the shortest path to travel to their destination.  
[10] This is a method to construct solutions based on the 
characteristics  of  the  past  solutions.  This  algorithm  is

Tree and star networking systems are examples of Global 
approach. 

Load Balancing effects cloud computing and improves 
the  performance  by  redistributing  the  load  among  the 
processors. Jobs are transferred from one node to another 
through the network involving some delay (queuing delay 
+processing  delay)  as  it has to  determine  the  destination 
node through remote processing. [11] 

     A distributed system model has n no. of users and m 
no  of  computing  resources.  Nash  Equilibrium  can  be 
defined  for  a  distributed  system  model  as  a  strategy  “s” 
for every user “u” as

The  Nash  equilibrium  is  achieved  when  no  user  can 
decrease 
time  by 
unilaterally  changing  its  strategy.  A  cloud  which  has  a 
normal  rate  should  dispatch  jobs  immediately  when  he 
receives  to  the  nodes  that  would  process  them.    These 
processors maintain a waiting queue therefore, the

     Having learnt the different ways the players can turn 
the  game  in  a  system,  one  of  the  issues  that  the  system 
might face is in deciding the period it is to be  refreshed. 
The refresh period cannot be too long or too short or else 
it would invite the inconsistency problem with erroneous 
load strategy and mistaken nodes choice. If it is long, the 
information  may  get  obsolete  and  the  system  would  not 
be able to make the right decision. Likewise, if the period 
is short, the frequency  would be very high impacting the 
performance of cloud computing. The refresh period also 
has  to  be  accurately  planned  to  avoid  inconsistency  and 
errors.

 

used for mobile networks. 
 

2.2 Game Theory approach for Load Balancing   

 

 This  algorithm  like  LBACO  is  also  based  on  Genetic 
behaviour  and  is  inspired  by  human  networking  where 
local  information  at  each  node  is  utilized  for  the 
distribution of jobs. Load balancing in cloud computing is 
viewed  as  a  game  with  the nodes  and  jobs  as  players  in 
the  game.  The  main  intention  is  to  overcome  the  load 
balancing  problem  by  using  Game  Theory.  A  game 
theoretic  approach  is  an  improvised  strategy  for  load 
balancing  through  efficient  job  scheduling  and  resource 
allocation  techniques.  All  nodes  should  be  processing 
equal  amount  of  work  at  any  time  basis  the  size, 
processing time and importance of the job.  

     Motivation  for  Game  theory  approach  for  Load 

Balancing in Cloud Computing 

Given that there is large no. of jobs in the cloud; Load 
Balancing  formulates  the  allocation  of  these  jobs  to 
computing  resources  optimizing  the  resource  utilization 
and response time. Every user has a different requirement   
and  selfishly  wants  all  the  resources  available  for  them 
while the computing resource has to substantially meet all 
these  requirements.  This  selfish  behaviour  in  the  cloud 
cannot  be  overcome  using  conventional  algorithms  for 
load balancing.  

     For  static  load  balancing,  a  cooperative  game  is 
modelled  taking  into  account  the  collected  system 
information.  The  decision  makers  cooperate  in  making 
decisions  to  reach  an  optimal  solution  which  is  in 
concurrence  and  agreement  with  all  players.  The  load 
balancing  problem  is  formulated  as  a  cooperative  game 
among 
the 
communication  networking  subsystem.  Nash  Bargaining 
Solution (NBS) provides the Pareto Optimal solution for 
cooperative load balancing game.  [11] 

heterogeneous 

“n” 

computers 

and 

     For dynamic or non cooperative games, the current 
state  of  the  system  is  taken  into  account  along  with  the 
static  load  balancing  scheme  to  try  and  reach  the  Nash 
Equilibrium. Since there are several interactions involved, 
each player has a strategy as the best response to the other 
player’s  strategy.  Nash  equilibrium  is  attained  based  on 
these  choices  of  strategies.  Each  player  makes  the  most 
optimized decision for himself and the optimal solution is 
achieved  when  no  player  can  benefit  by  changing  his 
decision. It is referred as Wardrop equilibrium when there 
are  infinite  no.  of  decision  makers,  whereas  Nash 
equilibrium  is  obtained  for  finite  no  of  decision  makers. 
The  expected  response  time  majorly  remains  low  and 
may  increase  when  the  system  utilization  is  very  high. 
[12] 

     A global approach to the game is when there is one 
decision  maker  supervising  all  the  jobs  and  status  of 
nodes  and 
is  responsible  for 

that  decision  maker

Game theory is  a better approach in many aspects and  
involves low  cost for maintaining the structure. We look 
forward to creating a load balancing algorithm that works 
as a non cooperative game among users and a cooperative 
game  among  processors.  The  load  balancing  algorithm 
would  be  effective  if  the  average  job  arrival  rate  from 
users is less than the average processing rate of the jobs in 
the  cloud.  Therefore,  it is  important  to  correctly  allocate 
the  distribution  of  jobs  from  the  users  to  the  processors. 
This is possible if we can accurately determine the time a 
job  takes  to  travel  from  the  user  to  the  cloud  which  is 
dependent on the to the average size of the job, distance 
between  user  and  processor,  bandwidth  available  within 
the cloud etc., [6] 

    
The considered factors are briefed below: [14] 
 
Throughput  –  It  is  the  amount  of  work  that  all  the 

nodes can process in a given time period.  

Response time – the elapsed time between the demand 
placed  and  the  beginning  of  a  response  after  completion 
of the job. Simply put, it is the time taken to respond by a 
particular  load  balancing  algorithm.  This  parameter 
should be minimized.  

Scalability  –  Ability  of  a  computer  application 
(hardware/software/service) 
its  function 
effectively even when its size, topography etc is changed.  
Priority – Preference of tasks based on factors like cost, 

to  continue 

time, size etc.,. [15] 

Fault  tolerance  -  System  designed  such  that  it  can 

tolerate and continue functioning despite any failure.  

Overhead  –  refers  to  the  processing  time  required  by 

the system for installation, operation or any transaction. 

Power  Consumption  – 

Cost – it is the cost involved in configuring the system 
and in processing the jobs demanded by the users, better 
defined as the usage of the machine per hour. 
Information 

technology 
consumes  tremendous  power  and  involves  high  energy 
costs. Efficient power management is vital for the success 
of  IT  environment  such  as  Cloud  computing,  Grid 
computing etc.,  

Complexity – Making the entire system difficult. With 
increasing  users  associating  with  the  cloud  and  its 
properties, the complexity of the system increases.  

Fairness  –  indicates  that  each  user  has  the  equal 
response  time  and  all  get  their  jobs  completed  within 
approximately the same time. 

Performance – it is the speed and accuracy at which the

jobs  are  completed  and  is  measured  against  the  preset 
standards. In simple words, it is the total efficiency of the 
system.  This  can  be  improved  by  reducing  the  task 
response time and waiting time maintaining a reasonable 
cost of the system.

CONCLUSION  

 

Cloud  Computing  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  IT 
fascism being widely accepted though in its nascent stage. 
Load Balancing has been one of the major issues in Cloud 
Computing.  This  paper  has  given  a  brief  of  load 
balancing  algorithms  and  explains  the  Game  theory 
concept  for  balancing  load  in  a  cloud  in  a  better  way. 
Cloud  computing  is  a  dynamic  mechanism  involving 
changes  every  day,  hence  the  algorithm  has  to  evolve 
with the on-going transformation. 

 A cooperative game among nodes or processors ensure 
minimal execution time whereas a non cooperative game 
between the users allow users to choose their best benefit 
strategy providing optimum job response time.  

This  is  a  conceptual  piece  of  work  and  some  more 
work  is  to  be  done  leading  to  its  execution  and 
implementation.  Amendments 
the  game-theoretic 
approach  to  load  balancing  would  be  made  as  per  the 
ongoing  changes  in  the  technology  of  cloud  computing 
and the problems that arise accordingly.
