Abstract— Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access 
to  a  shared  pool  of configurable  computing  resources. Reliability  in  compute  cloud  is  an 
important  aspect in Quality of Service which needs  to be addressed in  order to foster the 
adoption  of  compute  cloud.  In  today’s  integrated  environment  the  distributed  systems  is 
employed  to  carry  out  computational  intensive  task  at  a  faster  rate  without  much 
investment. The Cloud is a multitenant architecture which allows faster computation with 
high scalability at a lower cost thereby the users can share the same physical infrastructure. 
Individual customers deploy their applications in such environment will occupy the virtual 
partitions on the platform. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the 
reliability  of  the  application  from  the  view  point  of  the  resource  provider.  A  trust 
component is implemented to provide preventive control and to mitigate the occurrence of 
any non-permissible action by using the detective mechanism. Such mechanisms are used to 
identify the privacy risk and it further prevents from utilization. Hence, in this paper trust 
assessment is performed before the user is allowed to share the multitenant infrastructure. 
The cloud can provide scalable and reliable service for the legitimate users. The proposed 
work is tested using tools Aneka and Globus Toolkit.

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

obfuscation  and  de-obfuscation  of  personal,  sensitive,  or  confidential  data  within  cloud  service  provision. 
The privacy manager uses a feature called obfuscation. The idea is that instead of being present unencrypted 
in  the  cloud,  the  user’s  private  data  should  be  sent  to  the  cloud  in  an  encrypted  form,  and  the  processing 
needs to be done on the encrypted data. The output of the processing is deobfuscated by the privacy manager

(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual

Abstract— Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access 
to  a  shared  pool  of configurable  computing  resources. Reliability  in  compute  cloud  is  an 
important  aspect in Quality of Service which needs  to be addressed in  order to foster the 
adoption  of  compute  cloud.  In  today’s  integrated  environment  the  distributed  systems  is 
employed  to  carry  out  computational  intensive  task  at  a  faster  rate  without  much 
investment. The Cloud is a multitenant architecture which allows faster computation with 
high scalability at a lower cost thereby the users can share the same physical infrastructure. 
Individual customers deploy their applications in such environment will occupy the virtual 
partitions on the platform. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the 
reliability  of  the  application  from  the  view  point  of  the  resource  provider.  A  trust 
component is implemented to provide preventive control and to mitigate the occurrence of 
any non-permissible action by using the detective mechanism. Such mechanisms are used to 
identify the privacy risk and it further prevents from utilization. Hence, in this paper trust 
assessment is performed before the user is allowed to share the multitenant infrastructure. 
The cloud can provide scalable and reliable service for the legitimate users. The proposed 
work is tested using tools Aneka and Globus Toolkit.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cloud  computing  is  a  distributed  and  parallel  system  which  consists  of  a  collection  of  virtualized,  inter-
connected,  dynamically  provisioned  and  unified  computing  resources  which  is  based  on  service-level 
agreements that can be established through negotiation between the consumer and the service provider. The 
main  aim  of  a  distributed  computing  system  is  to  connect  users  and  share  IT  resources  in  an  open, 
transparent, cost-effective, reliable, scalable and secure way. Two main factors in cloud computing are cost 
and security. Outsourcing the computation tasks eliminates a significant amount of intervention time from the 
users  or  system  managers  required  for  the  installation,  configuration,  updating  and  removal  of  complex 
computer systems. The cloud of computer grids provides such services on fee-based, which can be more cost-
efficient  for the users than  purchasing, maintaining,  and upgrading  powerful servers. The  major issue with 
computational  cloud has  been its security.  The  apps written for the cloud always have  to be secure use  of 
cloud computing their own terms because they don’t automatically grant security compliance for the end-user 
data or apps on them. Even though cloud vendors deal with some of the responsibilities, application designer 
has the major responsibility. Studies made by Symantec, Gartner and others revealed that majority of attacks

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  technique  to  mitigate  the  problems  of  3,  4  and  5.  This  paper  proposes  a  trust 
assessment policy manager for cloud computing that is intended to control mutual policy management for the 
purpose  of  resource  utilization  thereby  it  removes  the  barrier  to  fear  of  provisioning  /  utilizing  the 
computational resources in the cloud.
Cloud relies on Grid Infrastructure which consists of grid nodes and communication network. Grid system is 
a mechanism to pool resources on-demand to improve the overall utilization of the system. Hence, it need to 
be monitored for various reasons like Utilization of resources, managing trust between systems and strangers, 
and authorization given to the users to access certain set of resources. Issues in such system are classified into 
three  categories  a.  Architecture  related  issues  b.  Infrastructure  related  issues  and  c.  Management  related 
issues. Since grid is heterogeneous in nature which consists of multiple entities or components, domains and 
policies and stake holders the  key challenge is managing trust and credentials. Trust management is highly 
crucial in dynamic grid because the grid nodes and users join and leave the system. The host is apprehensive 
to  be  a  part  of  the  system  since  it  suffers  from  two  drawbacks  Data  Protection  and Job  starvation.  Cloud 
utilizes this infrastructure to provide various types of services like Infrastructure, Platform and Software in 
the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
shown in  Fig.1. In  IaaS the computing resources including virtual  machines and other abstracted hardware 
and operating systems are delivered as a service in which the resources are managed through a service API. 
The customer rents these resources instead of buying them for their computation need ex. Amazon EC2, S3 
[2]. In PaaS the entire platform includes solution stack for software development and life cycle management 
software which can be accessed by the customers to develop new applications Ex. Google App Engine and 
Force.com [2]. In SaaS the applications are developed as a service which is utilized on-demand and pay for 
on  a  per-use  basis  [4].  The  main  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  our  trusted  system 
architecture  for  cloud  computing  solutions. It  aims  at  supporting  cloud  service  provider  to  identify 
trustworthy service consumer as well as non trustworthy consumer.

Figure 1. The Models of Cloud Service

A.  Types of Trust and Trust Levels
There  are  various  trust  levels  in  Cloud.  Out  of  five  different  levels  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  2,  we  have 
chosen the last level of trust. There are different types of trust which includes direct trust, indirect trust, full 

 
47

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Figure 2. Levels of Trust in Cloud Computing.[2]

 

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

II. RELATED WORK 
A.  Trust Assessment and Estabilishment Techniques 
Miranda  Mowbray et.al,  described  a  privacy  manager  for  cloud  computing  that  controls  policy-based 
obfuscation  and  de-obfuscation  of  personal,  sensitive,  or  confidential  data  within  cloud  service  provision. 
The privacy manager uses a feature called obfuscation. The idea is that instead of being present unencrypted 
in  the  cloud,  the  user’s  private  data  should  be  sent  to  the  cloud  in  an  encrypted  form,  and  the  processing 
needs to be done on the encrypted data. The output of the processing is deobfuscated by the privacy manager 
to reveal the correct result [5].
Zou  D  et.al,  explained  an  important  method  called  Automated  Trust  Negotiation  (ATN)  to  establish  trust 
relationship between two strangers by exchanging their access control policies and credentials.  To ease the 
burden  on  the  administrator  during  deploying  ATN  access  control  policies  and  credentials  in  virtual 
computing environment, automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation 
(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual 
machines  in  a  physical  node  into  a  privileged  virtual  machine.  Thus  VATN  could  be  used  to  centralize
negotiation  policies,  local  access  control  policies,  and  credentials  in  a  privileged  VM  on  a  physical  node 
[6][14][17][18]. Winsborough focused on the memory complexity of various ATN strategies. [16] 
Marco Casassa Mont et.al, explained about an approach based on a privacy-aware access control model. This 
model extends traditional access control model by explicitly dealing with the stated purposes for which data 
is collected, checking at the access request time the Intent of requestors against these purposes, dealing with 
data  subjects’  consent  and  enforcing  additional  access  conditions  and  constraints  defined  by  data  subjects 
and/or enterprise administrators [7] 
Casassa Mont M et.al, described about a suite of privacy technologies that have been developed by HP Labs,

with [8].

The general purpose software is being used within the cloud computing environment without addressing the

security breach if the cloud consumer (Resource consumer) is a hacker or disgruntled employee. She/he tries 
to exploit local data or to attack the cloud resource thereby an organization is exposed to potential loss and 

 
49

liability. Exploit based attacks have been popular in the past two decades. With reference to Fig. 3, there is a 
need for a solution to prevent general threats and data loss prevention.
In resource providers perspective there are various threats that may cause damage to the data or loss of data 
that are kept in the local  file system. A skilled exploit always try to lead the  application to a  known state 
during the preparatory phase of the attack. The attacker can force an application to take a specific path that 
will  lead  to  a  specific  request  or  set  of  requests.  On  executing  such  set  of  requests  for  multiple  times  an 
attacker can gather more and more information to predict the exact layout of the file system. For an example 
the usage model of the application running on a system may attempt to open a lower TCP or UDP ports (1 –
1023)  and  deleting  a  user  from  the  system  are  two  common  privileged  operations  and  both  of  these 
operations have to be carried out with super-user privileges. Such vulnerability of an application would give 
an  attacker  full  control  over  the  system  where  the  computation  is  being  carried  on.  In  addition  to  this  the 
kernel keeps track of process details such as what files it opened, its security credentials and what memory 
ranges it is using. On being able to successfully locate the structures that hold these details is the first step in 
kernel shell code development. On accessing the structure that holds the credentials for the running process 
the user can raise his privileges / capabilities. [20]
Multi tenancy is an architectural feature whereby single instance of software runs on a cloud vendor’s servers 
serving  multiple  client  organization.  In  IaaS  model  different  customers  are  users  of  resources  in  CSP’s 
servers. It is the responsibility of the CSP to isolate each user and to secure the secrecy of the data. There is a 
threat to the mechanisms sometimes if any of the tenants could get the privilege of super-user status thereby 
gaining the access of file system and other information.
The  CSP  uses  Meta  Scheduler  and  resource  management  to  schedule  the  job  or  uses  virtualization  to 
maximize  the  Hardware  utilization.  Virtual  machines  are  sandboxed  environment  that  isolate  each  other. 
Sometimes  these  securities  can  breakdown  allowing  attackers  to  escape  the  boundaries  of  this  sandboxed 
environment  and have  full  privileged  access to the host.  [4]  The Virtualization introduces  several security 
vulnerabilities like Cross – VM side channel attacks, virtual Network attacks, inadequate data deletion before 
memory is assigned to a different customer or “escape to the hypervisor where an attacker uses a guest virtual 
machine to attack vulnerabilities in hypervisor software. [4]
When a user uploads the input data to the cloud, the user’s data which is present in the unencrypted  form 
suffer  from  privacy  challenges.  [15]  The  strangers  over  the  cloud  need  to  establish  trust relationship.  Our 
objective is to protect a system by mitigating the effects of successful exploitation and to delimit the sensible 
boundaries  of  the  system.  It  is  necessary  to  manage  such  type  of  risks  intelligently  by  incorporating 
additional modules into the CSP’s site thereby the perspective of protecting local data can be attained. These 
modules are responsible for analyzing the unknown binaries by verifying the source code and data file of the 
client.

III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  
This  paper  has  addressed  the  issues  in  establishment  of  Trust  at  different  levels.  The  objective  of  the 
proposed  system  is  to  establish  a  trusted  cloud  computing  platform  for  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity  of  computations  without  Data  Loss  or  leakage.  Trust  Assessment  policy  manager  in  the  cloud
computing services is introduced to enhance the usability of Cloud without fear of adoption in sharing their 
resources to be a part of the cloud. Its main aim is to build up a trust between the end user and the cloud. This 
paper has introduced a Trust assessment module to ensure trust by assessing the job that includes source code 
or  executables  and  data that  is  submitted  by  the  end  user  for  sharing  computational  resources  in  Cloud 
(Figure 4).

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  technique  to  mitigate  the  problems  of  3,  4  and  5.  This  paper  proposes  a  trust

utilizes this infrastructure to provide various types of services like Infrastructure, Platform and Software in 
the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
shown in  Fig.1. In  IaaS the computing resources including virtual  machines and other abstracted hardware

architecture  for  cloud  computing  solutions. It  aims  at  supporting  cloud  service  provider  to  identify 
trustworthy service consumer as well as non trustworthy consumer.

A.  Types of Trust and Trust Levels
There  are  various  trust  levels  in  Cloud.  Out  of  five  different  levels  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  2,  we  have 
chosen the last level of trust. There are different types of trust which includes direct trust, indirect trust, full 

 
47

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Figure 2. Levels of Trust in Cloud Computing.[2]

 

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

relationship between two strangers by exchanging their access control policies and credentials.  To ease the 
burden  on  the  administrator  during  deploying  ATN  access  control  policies  and  credentials  in  virtual 
computing environment, automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation 
(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual 
machines  in  a  physical  node  into  a  privileged  virtual  machine.  Thus  VATN  could  be  used  to  centralize
negotiation  policies,  local  access  control  policies,  and  credentials  in  a  privileged  VM  on  a  physical  node 
[6][14][17][18]. Winsborough focused on the memory complexity of various ATN strategies. [16] 
Marco Casassa Mont et.al, explained about an approach based on a privacy-aware access control model. This 
model extends traditional access control model by explicitly dealing with the stated purposes for which data 
is collected, checking at the access request time the Intent of requestors against these purposes, dealing with 
data  subjects’  consent  and  enforcing  additional  access  conditions  and  constraints  defined  by  data  subjects 
and/or enterprise administrators [7] 
Casassa Mont M et.al, described about a suite of privacy technologies that have been developed by HP Labs, 
in an integrated way, to help enterprises to  automate the  management and enforcement of privacy  policies 
(including privacy obligations) and the process of checking such policies and legislation are indeed complied 
with [8].
Ryan  K  L  Ko  et.al,  discusses  key  challenges  in  achieving  a  trusted  cloud  through  the  use  of  detective 
controls,  and  presents  the  Trust  Cloud  framework,  which  addresses  accountability  in  cloud  computing  via 
technical and policy based approaches. This paper establishes the urgent need for research in accountability

in the cloud and outlines the risks of not achieving it. They have proposed a detective rather than preventive 
approaches to increasing accountability. [9] 
Pearson S et.al, described about securing the information transferred in distributed computing environments. 
Personal and confidential information is stored on a wide variety of enterprise data resources. To secure and 
protect  this  data,  technology  must  adapt  to  mitigate  the  threats  and  risks  arising  from  the  trend  towards 
dynamic enterprises, adaptive data centers, and on-demand resource allocation. [10] 
In protection of identity information in cloud computing without trusted third party, cloud computing allows 
the  use  of  Internet-based  services  to  support  business  processes  and  rental  of  IT-services  on  a  utility-like 
basis. It offers a concentration of resources but also poses risks for data privacy. Identity management (IDM) 
is  one  of  the  core  components  in  cloud  privacy  and  security  and  can  help  alleviate  some  of  the  problems 
associated with cloud computing. [11] Haines presents a comprehensive to risk management. [13] 
Extensive sharing of computing resources can be done using cloud infrastructure. The risk is varied upon the 
deployment model. Vulnerability is very high when a cloud is utilized as IaaS. The consumer of IaaS needs 
to build in security as they are primarily responsible for it. There is a risk to the data stored in the machine 
which is the part of a cloud when user submits a job with a malicious code. Such environment needs to be 
protected from both intrusions and execution of malicious code.
Sarah Kim and Ayoung had explored the factors that affect the formation of trust or distrust on cloud services 
and Cloud Service Provider CSP from the perspective of ordinary individual user [12]. If such ordinary users 
are  engaged  with  Cloud  services  in  their  everyday  life  for  various  purposes  there  are  certain  set  of 
customized users who engage with cloud computing to consume IaaS faces different type of threat which is 
neither  identified  nor  focused.  The  obfuscation  feature  of  the  privacy  manager  is  not  suitable  for  cloud 
applications. [19]
B.  Threats and Vulnerability 
Analyzing Risk is more important while adopting Cloud Concepts. Risk provides both opportunity and peril.

Figure 3. Cloud risk relative to other security concerns[2]

The general purpose software is being used within the cloud computing environment without addressing the 
fundamental  risk  associated  to  this  new  technology.  The  consequence  of  migrating  towards  the  existing 
software  infrastructure  to  cloud  increases  the  risk  of  organizational data.  Hence  organization  needs  to 
accommodate the changes in the software stack. According to the detailed analysis made in previous section,
focuses on the formation of trust or distrust for cloud services and CSP identified during the initial analysis 
correspond to trust building made for information systems and e-commerce. The analysis is with respect to 
ordinary users. In general even though cloud storage can be more at risk from malicious behavior recently 
performing higher computational intensive task in cloud also introduces lot of exposure for a long period of 
time  and  risk  from  malicious  behaviors.  There  are  another  category  of  users  who  uses  the  IaaS  on  cloud 
where their computations will be done on different CSPs. The fear of utilizing such cloud service is analyzed 
with respect to two different perspectives – Resource Provider and Resource Consumer. There is a chance for 
security breach if the cloud consumer (Resource consumer) is a hacker or disgruntled employee. She/he tries 
to exploit local data or to attack the cloud resource thereby an organization is exposed to potential loss and 

 
49

liability. Exploit based attacks have been popular in the past two decades. With reference to Fig. 3, there is a 
need for a solution to prevent general threats and data loss prevention.
In resource providers perspective there are various threats that may cause damage to the data or loss of data 
that are kept in the local  file system. A skilled exploit always try to lead the  application to a  known state 
during the preparatory phase of the attack. The attacker can force an application to take a specific path that 
will  lead  to  a  specific  request  or  set  of  requests.  On  executing  such  set  of  requests  for  multiple  times  an 
attacker can gather more and more information to predict the exact layout of the file system. For an example 
the usage model of the application running on a system may attempt to open a lower TCP or UDP ports (1 –
1023)  and  deleting  a  user  from  the  system  are  two  common  privileged  operations  and  both  of  these 
operations have to be carried out with super-user privileges. Such vulnerability of an application would give 
an  attacker  full  control  over  the  system  where  the  computation  is  being  carried  on.  In  addition  to  this  the 
kernel keeps track of process details such as what files it opened, its security credentials and what memory 
ranges it is using. On being able to successfully locate the structures that hold these details is the first step in 
kernel shell code development. On accessing the structure that holds the credentials for the running process 
the user can raise his privileges / capabilities. [20]
Multi tenancy is an architectural feature whereby single instance of software runs on a cloud vendor’s servers 
serving  multiple  client  organization.  In  IaaS  model  different  customers  are  users  of  resources  in  CSP’s 
servers. It is the responsibility of the CSP to isolate each user and to secure the secrecy of the data. There is a 
threat to the mechanisms sometimes if any of the tenants could get the privilege of super-user status thereby 
gaining the access of file system and other information.
The  CSP  uses  Meta  Scheduler  and  resource  management  to  schedule  the  job  or  uses  virtualization  to 
maximize  the  Hardware  utilization.  Virtual  machines  are  sandboxed  environment  that  isolate  each  other. 
Sometimes  these  securities  can  breakdown  allowing  attackers  to  escape  the  boundaries  of  this  sandboxed 
environment  and have  full  privileged  access to the host.  [4]  The Virtualization introduces  several security 
vulnerabilities like Cross – VM side channel attacks, virtual Network attacks, inadequate data deletion before 
memory is assigned to a different customer or “escape to the hypervisor where an attacker uses a guest virtual 
machine to attack vulnerabilities in hypervisor software. [4]
When a user uploads the input data to the cloud, the user’s data which is present in the unencrypted  form 
suffer  from  privacy  challenges.  [15]  The  strangers  over  the  cloud  need  to  establish  trust relationship.  Our 
objective is to protect a system by mitigating the effects of successful exploitation and to delimit the sensible 
boundaries  of  the  system.  It  is  necessary  to  manage  such  type  of  risks  intelligently  by  incorporating 
additional modules into the CSP’s site thereby the perspective of protecting local data can be attained. These 
modules are responsible for analyzing the unknown binaries by verifying the source code and data file of the 
client.

III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  
This  paper  has  addressed  the  issues  in  establishment  of  Trust  at  different  levels.  The  objective  of  the 
proposed  system  is  to  establish  a  trusted  cloud  computing  platform  for  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity  of  computations  without  Data  Loss  or  leakage.  Trust  Assessment  policy  manager  in  the  cloud
computing services is introduced to enhance the usability of Cloud without fear of adoption in sharing their 
resources to be a part of the cloud. Its main aim is to build up a trust between the end user and the cloud. This 
paper has introduced a Trust assessment module to ensure trust by assessing the job that includes source code 
or  executables  and  data that  is  submitted  by  the  end  user  for  sharing  computational  resources  in  Cloud 
(Figure 4).

Figure 4. Overall Proposed System Design

A.  Description of Trust Assessment Module  [TAM]
We  present  the  Trust  Assessment  Module  that  provides  a  jailed  (Closed  Box)  Application  execution 
environment for the users with the limited privileges for utilizing the cloud computational resources.(Figure 
5) The cloud user submits the job may be unknown to the host running the job. If the job carries a virus/worm 
it will destroy the data in the local file system. It is called Data protection issue. The CSP needs to implement 
the routines to check before handling the application / code in order to ensure if there is any malicious lines 
of code or malware is present or not. Primarily the job which consists of data and source code are sent by the 
cloud user to Trust assessment Module. Request handler is designed to handle every request from the remote 
client and send the request along with the job to the Authorization engine.  The authorization engine checks 
the client’s requirement with the Service  provider’s description in order to check if the requestor complies 
with  provider’s  policy.  On  assessing  if  it  complies  the  job  is  sent  to  the  Trust  Evaluator  Module  present 
within the Trust Assessment Module. The  trust negotiation process  consists  of  verification in three  stages. 
They are 1. The job is verified for its integrity. This is done in order to ensure if there is any  modification 
made in  the  middle by  performing Man-in-the-Middle attack. 2.  Check if the files  submitted  by the client 
contain any virus signatures or Trojan horse. This is done by utilizing the Third party Antivirus toolkits with 
its latest patch updated automatically. 3. Ensure whether the code has any unauthorized privileged operation 
which is not explicitly specified  at the time of Job submission in  Service  Level Agreement. On successful 
verification of all the three stages the Job status is updated as “READY” or “CANCELLED”.

Figure 5. Design of Trust Assessment Module

When  the  status  of  the  job  is  updated  as  “READY”  the job  is  redirected  by  the  trust  evaluator  to  the  Job 
scheduler.  The  job  scheduler  is  an  interface  which interconnects  the  proposed  work  to  the  existing  cloud 
where  Globus[21] is  used.  In  this  paper  we  have  focused  in  the  lower  layer  of  IaaS.  Trust  Assessment 
Module (TAM) is used to establish the mutual trust between the client and the virtual machine in the most 
trusted  private  cloud. Client’s  policies  are  sent  by  job scheduler  to  a  Policy  Enforcement  Point  (PEM)  of 
remote  private  cloud  which  contains  policies  of  each  Virtual Machine  (VM)  in  that  Virtual  Organization.
Functionalities such as  crosschecking the  policies and accessing the information handed  over  by the  Trust 
Manager with each virtual machine policies are done by the Policy Enforcement Module. If the policies of 
client  are  satisfied,  then  all  its  client  related  policies  are  handed  over  to  the  CSP.  The  proposed  system 
ensures that the job does not contain any threats which may cause risk of data theft or corrupting the data. 
The data thieves break in to the provider’s machine as though they are legitimate users. The objective of such 
user is either to steal the data / corrupt the data or to attack other customers of the same service if there is 
inadequate separation  of different customers.  In  order to prevent such  vulnerability the proposed system is 
incorporated  with  the  additional  feature  of  Privilege  Separation.  The  Privilege  Separation  is  to  reduce  as 
much as possible the amount of code that runs with full privileges. For each job submitted to the compute 
cloud by the user, the principle of least privilege is applied to the whole system. Each user is allocated the 
smallest  set  of  privileges  necessary  to  perform  the  tasks  he  or  she  needs  to  accomplish  the  execution  of 
remote Job.

Abstract— Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access 
to  a  shared  pool  of configurable  computing  resources. Reliability  in  compute  cloud  is  an 
important  aspect in Quality of Service which needs  to be addressed in  order to foster the 
adoption  of  compute  cloud.  In  today’s  integrated  environment  the  distributed  systems  is 
employed  to  carry  out  computational  intensive  task  at  a  faster  rate  without  much 
investment. The Cloud is a multitenant architecture which allows faster computation with 
high scalability at a lower cost thereby the users can share the same physical infrastructure. 
Individual customers deploy their applications in such environment will occupy the virtual 
partitions on the platform. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the 
reliability  of  the  application  from  the  view  point  of  the  resource  provider.  A  trust 
component is implemented to provide preventive control and to mitigate the occurrence of 
any non-permissible action by using the detective mechanism. Such mechanisms are used to 
identify the privacy risk and it further prevents from utilization. Hence, in this paper trust 
assessment is performed before the user is allowed to share the multitenant infrastructure. 
The cloud can provide scalable and reliable service for the legitimate users. The proposed 
work is tested using tools Aneka and Globus Toolkit.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cloud  computing  is  a  distributed  and  parallel  system  which  consists  of  a  collection  of  virtualized,  inter-
connected,  dynamically  provisioned  and  unified  computing  resources  which  is  based  on  service-level 
agreements that can be established through negotiation between the consumer and the service provider. The 
main  aim  of  a  distributed  computing  system  is  to  connect  users  and  share  IT  resources  in  an  open, 
transparent, cost-effective, reliable, scalable and secure way. Two main factors in cloud computing are cost 
and security. Outsourcing the computation tasks eliminates a significant amount of intervention time from the 
users  or  system  managers  required  for  the  installation,  configuration,  updating  and  removal  of  complex 
computer systems. The cloud of computer grids provides such services on fee-based, which can be more cost-
efficient  for the users than  purchasing, maintaining,  and upgrading  powerful servers. The  major issue with 
computational  cloud has  been its security.  The  apps written for the cloud always have  to be secure use  of 
cloud computing their own terms because they don’t automatically grant security compliance for the end-user 
data or apps on them. Even though cloud vendors deal with some of the responsibilities, application designer 
has the major responsibility. Studies made by Symantec, Gartner and others revealed that majority of attacks

on  IT  enterprises  today  occur  at  the  application  layer  and  are  remotely  exploitable.  The  Cloud  Security 
Alliance has recognized top threats to cloud computing are [1]

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  technique  to  mitigate  the  problems  of  3,  4  and  5.  This  paper  proposes  a  trust 
assessment policy manager for cloud computing that is intended to control mutual policy management for the 
purpose  of  resource  utilization  thereby  it  removes  the  barrier  to  fear  of  provisioning  /  utilizing  the 
computational resources in the cloud.
Cloud relies on Grid Infrastructure which consists of grid nodes and communication network. Grid system is 
a mechanism to pool resources on-demand to improve the overall utilization of the system. Hence, it need to 
be monitored for various reasons like Utilization of resources, managing trust between systems and strangers, 
and authorization given to the users to access certain set of resources. Issues in such system are classified into 
three  categories  a.  Architecture  related  issues  b.  Infrastructure  related  issues  and  c.  Management  related 
issues. Since grid is heterogeneous in nature which consists of multiple entities or components, domains and 
policies and stake holders the  key challenge is managing trust and credentials. Trust management is highly 
crucial in dynamic grid because the grid nodes and users join and leave the system. The host is apprehensive 
to  be  a  part  of  the  system  since  it  suffers  from  two  drawbacks  Data  Protection  and Job  starvation.  Cloud 
utilizes this infrastructure to provide various types of services like Infrastructure, Platform and Software in 
the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
shown in  Fig.1. In  IaaS the computing resources including virtual  machines and other abstracted hardware 
and operating systems are delivered as a service in which the resources are managed through a service API. 
The customer rents these resources instead of buying them for their computation need ex. Amazon EC2, S3 
[2]. In PaaS the entire platform includes solution stack for software development and life cycle management 
software which can be accessed by the customers to develop new applications Ex. Google App Engine and 
Force.com [2]. In SaaS the applications are developed as a service which is utilized on-demand and pay for 
on  a  per-use  basis  [4].  The  main  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  our  trusted  system 
architecture  for  cloud  computing  solutions. It  aims  at  supporting  cloud  service  provider  to  identify 
trustworthy service consumer as well as non trustworthy consumer.

Figure 1. The Models of Cloud Service

A.  Types of Trust and Trust Levels
There  are  various  trust  levels  in  Cloud.  Out  of  five  different  levels  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  2,  we  have 
chosen the last level of trust. There are different types of trust which includes direct trust, indirect trust, full 

 
47

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Figure 2. Levels of Trust in Cloud Computing.[2]

 

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

II. RELATED WORK 
A.  Trust Assessment and Estabilishment Techniques 
Miranda  Mowbray et.al,  described  a  privacy  manager  for  cloud  computing  that  controls  policy-based 
obfuscation  and  de-obfuscation  of  personal,  sensitive,  or  confidential  data  within  cloud  service  provision. 
The privacy manager uses a feature called obfuscation. The idea is that instead of being present unencrypted 
in  the  cloud,  the  user’s  private  data  should  be  sent  to  the  cloud  in  an  encrypted  form,  and  the  processing 
needs to be done on the encrypted data. The output of the processing is deobfuscated by the privacy manager 
to reveal the correct result [5].
Zou  D  et.al,  explained  an  important  method  called  Automated  Trust  Negotiation  (ATN)  to  establish  trust 
relationship between two strangers by exchanging their access control policies and credentials.  To ease the 
burden  on  the  administrator  during  deploying  ATN  access  control  policies  and  credentials  in  virtual 
computing environment, automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation 
(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual 
machines  in  a  physical  node  into  a  privileged  virtual  machine.  Thus  VATN  could  be  used  to  centralize
negotiation  policies,  local  access  control  policies,  and  credentials  in  a  privileged  VM  on  a  physical  node 
[6][14][17][18]. Winsborough focused on the memory complexity of various ATN strategies. [16]

This  paper  has  addressed  the  issues  in  establishment  of  Trust  at  different  levels.  The  objective  of  the 
proposed  system  is  to  establish  a  trusted  cloud  computing  platform  for  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity  of  computations  without  Data  Loss  or  leakage.  Trust  Assessment  policy  manager  in  the  cloud
computing services is introduced to enhance the usability of Cloud without fear of adoption in sharing their 
resources to be a part of the cloud. Its main aim is to build up a trust between the end user and the cloud. This 
paper has introduced a Trust assessment module to ensure trust by assessing the job that includes source code 
or  executables  and  data that  is  submitted  by  the  end  user  for  sharing  computational  resources  in  Cloud 
(Figure 4).

A.  Description of Trust Assessment Module  [TAM]
We  present  the  Trust  Assessment  Module  that  provides  a  jailed  (Closed  Box)  Application  execution 
environment for the users with the limited privileges for utilizing the cloud computational resources.(Figure 
5) The cloud user submits the job may be unknown to the host running the job. If the job carries a virus/worm 
it will destroy the data in the local file system. It is called Data protection issue. The CSP needs to implement 
the routines to check before handling the application / code in order to ensure if there is any malicious lines 
of code or malware is present or not. Primarily the job which consists of data and source code are sent by the 
cloud user to Trust assessment Module. Request handler is designed to handle every request from the remote 
client and send the request along with the job to the Authorization engine.  The authorization engine checks 
the client’s requirement with the Service  provider’s description in order to check if the requestor complies 
with  provider’s  policy.  On  assessing  if  it  complies  the  job  is  sent  to  the  Trust  Evaluator  Module  present 
within the Trust Assessment Module. The  trust negotiation process  consists  of  verification in three  stages. 
They are 1. The job is verified for its integrity. This is done in order to ensure if there is any  modification 
made in  the  middle by  performing Man-in-the-Middle attack. 2.  Check if the files  submitted  by the client 
contain any virus signatures or Trojan horse. This is done by utilizing the Third party Antivirus toolkits with 
its latest patch updated automatically. 3. Ensure whether the code has any unauthorized privileged operation 
which is not explicitly specified  at the time of Job submission in  Service  Level Agreement. On successful 
verification of all the three stages the Job status is updated as “READY” or “CANCELLED”.

Figure 5. Design of Trust Assessment Module

When  the  status  of  the  job  is  updated  as  “READY”  the job  is  redirected  by  the  trust  evaluator  to  the  Job 
scheduler.  The  job  scheduler  is  an  interface  which interconnects  the  proposed  work  to  the  existing  cloud 
where  Globus[21] is  used.  In  this  paper  we  have  focused  in  the  lower  layer  of  IaaS.  Trust  Assessment 
Module (TAM) is used to establish the mutual trust between the client and the virtual machine in the most 
trusted  private  cloud. Client’s  policies  are  sent  by  job scheduler  to  a  Policy  Enforcement  Point  (PEM)  of 
remote  private  cloud  which  contains  policies  of  each  Virtual Machine  (VM)  in  that  Virtual  Organization.
Functionalities such as  crosschecking the  policies and accessing the information handed  over  by the  Trust 
Manager with each virtual machine policies are done by the Policy Enforcement Module. If the policies of 
client  are  satisfied,  then  all  its  client  related  policies  are  handed  over  to  the  CSP.  The  proposed  system 
ensures that the job does not contain any threats which may cause risk of data theft or corrupting the data. 
The data thieves break in to the provider’s machine as though they are legitimate users. The objective of such 
user is either to steal the data / corrupt the data or to attack other customers of the same service if there is 
inadequate separation  of different customers.  In  order to prevent such  vulnerability the proposed system is 
incorporated  with  the  additional  feature  of  Privilege  Separation.  The  Privilege  Separation  is  to  reduce  as 
much as possible the amount of code that runs with full privileges. For each job submitted to the compute 
cloud by the user, the principle of least privilege is applied to the whole system. Each user is allocated the 
smallest  set  of  privileges  necessary  to  perform  the  tasks  he  or  she  needs  to  accomplish  the  execution  of 
remote Job.

B.  Implementation and Testing 

The proposed system is implemented in two modules viz. the TAM and the Privilege Separation Module at 
the Resource. The TAM is implemented using JAVA and Privilege separation module is implemented using
Shell programming.  Privilege Separation module is designed  and implemented for two different operating 
systems Linux and Windows. The privilege separation module is loaded on every resource which is a part of 
the private cloud.. The  user friendly interface is designed  and implemented using PHP  and it is interfaced 
with the GT4 and Aneka software to setup a cloud. The test bed is created by utilizing five workstations with 
the  configurations  of  Intel  Core  2  Duo  Processor  with  2  GB  RAM  and  500  GB  HDD  interconnected  by 
10/100 Mbps CAT-5 Ethernet cable. The operating system Linux and Windows 2000 is installed on it with 
the installation of Aneka in 2 nodes and GT4 on 3 nodes in which a single node acts as a Master Node and 2 
nodes act as Compute Nodes.
1) Request Handler
A protocol socket is used in order to connect the end user with TAM. It consists of a listener process which is 
listening to port number 7000.  The cloud users can contact the cloud by accessing the user friendly interface. 
By  using  this  port  number  any  number  of  users  can  be  connected  to  the  TAM  module.  Any  user  who is 
interested to use the cloud as IaaS needs to access this user friendly portal in order to submit the job. The user 
submits the Source Code/ Executable file and Data File through this portal and furnishes his/her platform and 
resource  requirement.  Platform  includes  the  type  of  operating  system  and  resource  include  what  type  of
processor and other details about the approximate Cost estimation for resource utilization and time deadline 
for job execution. Before it is uploaded the Message digest is computed for the job and it is attached to the 
uploaded files. 
2) Authorization Engine
On receiving the job  and the Service level requirements  from the user it accesses the  policies  from Cloud 
Security policy database in order to match the requirement of the service consumer with that of the service 
provider’s.  In case if there is no match the request will not be accepted and forwarded to the Trust evaluator 
else it is forwarded to the trust evaluator (Figure 6).

Abstract— Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access 
to  a  shared  pool  of configurable  computing  resources. Reliability  in  compute  cloud  is  an 
important  aspect in Quality of Service which needs  to be addressed in  order to foster the 
adoption  of  compute  cloud.  In  today’s  integrated  environment  the  distributed  systems  is 
employed  to  carry  out  computational  intensive  task  at  a  faster  rate  without  much 
investment. The Cloud is a multitenant architecture which allows faster computation with 
high scalability at a lower cost thereby the users can share the same physical infrastructure. 
Individual customers deploy their applications in such environment will occupy the virtual 
partitions on the platform. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the 
reliability  of  the  application  from  the  view  point  of  the  resource  provider.  A  trust 
component is implemented to provide preventive control and to mitigate the occurrence of 
any non-permissible action by using the detective mechanism. Such mechanisms are used to 
identify the privacy risk and it further prevents from utilization. Hence, in this paper trust 
assessment is performed before the user is allowed to share the multitenant infrastructure. 
The cloud can provide scalable and reliable service for the legitimate users. The proposed 
work is tested using tools Aneka and Globus Toolkit.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cloud  computing  is  a  distributed  and  parallel  system  which  consists  of  a  collection  of  virtualized,  inter-
connected,  dynamically  provisioned  and  unified  computing  resources  which  is  based  on  service-level 
agreements that can be established through negotiation between the consumer and the service provider. The 
main  aim  of  a  distributed  computing  system  is  to  connect  users  and  share  IT  resources  in  an  open, 
transparent, cost-effective, reliable, scalable and secure way. Two main factors in cloud computing are cost 
and security. Outsourcing the computation tasks eliminates a significant amount of intervention time from the 
users  or  system  managers  required  for  the  installation,  configuration,  updating  and  removal  of  complex 
computer systems. The cloud of computer grids provides such services on fee-based, which can be more cost-
efficient  for the users than  purchasing, maintaining,  and upgrading  powerful servers. The  major issue with 
computational  cloud has  been its security.  The  apps written for the cloud always have  to be secure use  of 
cloud computing their own terms because they don’t automatically grant security compliance for the end-user 
data or apps on them. Even though cloud vendors deal with some of the responsibilities, application designer 
has the major responsibility. Studies made by Symantec, Gartner and others revealed that majority of attacks

on  IT  enterprises  today  occur  at  the  application  layer  and  are  remotely  exploitable.  The  Cloud  Security 
Alliance has recognized top threats to cloud computing are [1]

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  technique  to  mitigate  the  problems  of  3,  4  and  5.  This  paper  proposes  a  trust 
assessment policy manager for cloud computing that is intended to control mutual policy management for the 
purpose  of  resource  utilization  thereby  it  removes  the  barrier  to  fear  of  provisioning  /  utilizing  the 
computational resources in the cloud.
Cloud relies on Grid Infrastructure which consists of grid nodes and communication network. Grid system is 
a mechanism to pool resources on-demand to improve the overall utilization of the system. Hence, it need to 
be monitored for various reasons like Utilization of resources, managing trust between systems and strangers, 
and authorization given to the users to access certain set of resources. Issues in such system are classified into 
three  categories  a.  Architecture  related  issues  b.  Infrastructure  related  issues  and  c.  Management  related 
issues. Since grid is heterogeneous in nature which consists of multiple entities or components, domains and 
policies and stake holders the  key challenge is managing trust and credentials. Trust management is highly 
crucial in dynamic grid because the grid nodes and users join and leave the system. The host is apprehensive 
to  be  a  part  of  the  system  since  it  suffers  from  two  drawbacks  Data  Protection  and Job  starvation.  Cloud 
utilizes this infrastructure to provide various types of services like Infrastructure, Platform and Software in 
the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
shown in  Fig.1. In  IaaS the computing resources including virtual  machines and other abstracted hardware 
and operating systems are delivered as a service in which the resources are managed through a service API. 
The customer rents these resources instead of buying them for their computation need ex. Amazon EC2, S3 
[2]. In PaaS the entire platform includes solution stack for software development and life cycle management 
software which can be accessed by the customers to develop new applications Ex. Google App Engine and 
Force.com [2]. In SaaS the applications are developed as a service which is utilized on-demand and pay for 
on  a  per-use  basis  [4].  The  main  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  our  trusted  system 
architecture  for  cloud  computing  solutions. It  aims  at  supporting  cloud  service  provider  to  identify 
trustworthy service consumer as well as non trustworthy consumer.

Figure 1. The Models of Cloud Service

A.  Types of Trust and Trust Levels
There  are  various  trust  levels  in  Cloud.  Out  of  five  different  levels  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  2,  we  have 
chosen the last level of trust. There are different types of trust which includes direct trust, indirect trust, full 

 
47

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Figure 2. Levels of Trust in Cloud Computing.[2]

 

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

II. RELATED WORK 
A.  Trust Assessment and Estabilishment Techniques 
Miranda  Mowbray et.al,  described  a  privacy  manager  for  cloud  computing  that  controls  policy-based 
obfuscation  and  de-obfuscation  of  personal,  sensitive,  or  confidential  data  within  cloud  service  provision. 
The privacy manager uses a feature called obfuscation. The idea is that instead of being present unencrypted 
in  the  cloud,  the  user’s  private  data  should  be  sent  to  the  cloud  in  an  encrypted  form,  and  the  processing 
needs to be done on the encrypted data. The output of the processing is deobfuscated by the privacy manager 
to reveal the correct result [5].
Zou  D  et.al,  explained  an  important  method  called  Automated  Trust  Negotiation  (ATN)  to  establish  trust 
relationship between two strangers by exchanging their access control policies and credentials.  To ease the 
burden  on  the  administrator  during  deploying  ATN  access  control  policies  and  credentials  in  virtual 
computing environment, automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation 
(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual 
machines  in  a  physical  node  into  a  privileged  virtual  machine.  Thus  VATN  could  be  used  to  centralize
negotiation  policies,  local  access  control  policies,  and  credentials  in  a  privileged  VM  on  a  physical  node 
[6][14][17][18]. Winsborough focused on the memory complexity of various ATN strategies. [16] 
Marco Casassa Mont et.al, explained about an approach based on a privacy-aware access control model. This 
model extends traditional access control model by explicitly dealing with the stated purposes for which data 
is collected, checking at the access request time the Intent of requestors against these purposes, dealing with 
data  subjects’  consent  and  enforcing  additional  access  conditions  and  constraints  defined  by  data  subjects 
and/or enterprise administrators [7] 
Casassa Mont M et.al, described about a suite of privacy technologies that have been developed by HP Labs, 
in an integrated way, to help enterprises to  automate the  management and enforcement of privacy  policies 
(including privacy obligations) and the process of checking such policies and legislation are indeed complied 
with [8].
Ryan  K  L  Ko  et.al,  discusses  key  challenges  in  achieving  a  trusted  cloud  through  the  use  of  detective 
controls,  and  presents  the  Trust  Cloud  framework,  which  addresses  accountability  in  cloud  computing  via 
technical and policy based approaches. This paper establishes the urgent need for research in accountability 

 
48

in the cloud and outlines the risks of not achieving it. They have proposed a detective rather than preventive 
approaches to increasing accountability. [9] 
Pearson S et.al, described about securing the information transferred in distributed computing environments. 
Personal and confidential information is stored on a wide variety of enterprise data resources. To secure and 
protect  this  data,  technology  must  adapt  to  mitigate  the  threats  and  risks  arising  from  the  trend  towards 
dynamic enterprises, adaptive data centers, and on-demand resource allocation. [10] 
In protection of identity information in cloud computing without trusted third party, cloud computing allows 
the  use  of  Internet-based  services  to  support  business  processes  and  rental  of  IT-services  on  a  utility-like 
basis. It offers a concentration of resources but also poses risks for data privacy. Identity management (IDM) 
is  one  of  the  core  components  in  cloud  privacy  and  security  and  can  help  alleviate  some  of  the  problems 
associated with cloud computing. [11] Haines presents a comprehensive to risk management. [13] 
Extensive sharing of computing resources can be done using cloud infrastructure. The risk is varied upon the 
deployment model. Vulnerability is very high when a cloud is utilized as IaaS. The consumer of IaaS needs 
to build in security as they are primarily responsible for it. There is a risk to the data stored in the machine 
which is the part of a cloud when user submits a job with a malicious code. Such environment needs to be 
protected from both intrusions and execution of malicious code.
Sarah Kim and Ayoung had explored the factors that affect the formation of trust or distrust on cloud services 
and Cloud Service Provider CSP from the perspective of ordinary individual user [12]. If such ordinary users 
are  engaged  with  Cloud  services  in  their  everyday  life  for  various  purposes  there  are  certain  set  of 
customized users who engage with cloud computing to consume IaaS faces different type of threat which is 
neither  identified  nor  focused.  The  obfuscation  feature  of  the  privacy  manager  is  not  suitable  for  cloud 
applications. [19]
B.  Threats and Vulnerability 
Analyzing Risk is more important while adopting Cloud Concepts. Risk provides both opportunity and peril.

Figure 3. Cloud risk relative to other security concerns[2]

The general purpose software is being used within the cloud computing environment without addressing the 
fundamental  risk  associated  to  this  new  technology.  The  consequence  of  migrating  towards  the  existing 
software  infrastructure  to  cloud  increases  the  risk  of  organizational data.  Hence  organization  needs  to 
accommodate the changes in the software stack. According to the detailed analysis made in previous section,
focuses on the formation of trust or distrust for cloud services and CSP identified during the initial analysis 
correspond to trust building made for information systems and e-commerce. The analysis is with respect to 
ordinary users. In general even though cloud storage can be more at risk from malicious behavior recently 
performing higher computational intensive task in cloud also introduces lot of exposure for a long period of 
time  and  risk  from  malicious  behaviors.  There  are  another  category  of  users  who  uses  the  IaaS  on  cloud 
where their computations will be done on different CSPs. The fear of utilizing such cloud service is analyzed 
with respect to two different perspectives – Resource Provider and Resource Consumer. There is a chance for 
security breach if the cloud consumer (Resource consumer) is a hacker or disgruntled employee. She/he tries 
to exploit local data or to attack the cloud resource thereby an organization is exposed to potential loss and 

 
49

liability. Exploit based attacks have been popular in the past two decades. With reference to Fig. 3, there is a 
need for a solution to prevent general threats and data loss prevention.
In resource providers perspective there are various threats that may cause damage to the data or loss of data 
that are kept in the local  file system. A skilled exploit always try to lead the  application to a  known state 
during the preparatory phase of the attack. The attacker can force an application to take a specific path that 
will  lead  to  a  specific  request  or  set  of  requests.  On  executing  such  set  of  requests  for  multiple  times  an 
attacker can gather more and more information to predict the exact layout of the file system. For an example 
the usage model of the application running on a system may attempt to open a lower TCP or UDP ports (1 –
1023)  and  deleting  a  user  from  the  system  are  two  common  privileged  operations  and  both  of  these 
operations have to be carried out with super-user privileges. Such vulnerability of an application would give 
an  attacker  full  control  over  the  system  where  the  computation  is  being  carried  on.  In  addition  to  this  the 
kernel keeps track of process details such as what files it opened, its security credentials and what memory 
ranges it is using. On being able to successfully locate the structures that hold these details is the first step in 
kernel shell code development. On accessing the structure that holds the credentials for the running process 
the user can raise his privileges / capabilities. [20]
Multi tenancy is an architectural feature whereby single instance of software runs on a cloud vendor’s servers 
serving  multiple  client  organization.  In  IaaS  model  different  customers  are  users  of  resources  in  CSP’s 
servers. It is the responsibility of the CSP to isolate each user and to secure the secrecy of the data. There is a 
threat to the mechanisms sometimes if any of the tenants could get the privilege of super-user status thereby 
gaining the access of file system and other information.
The  CSP  uses  Meta  Scheduler  and  resource  management  to  schedule  the  job  or  uses  virtualization  to 
maximize  the  Hardware  utilization.  Virtual  machines  are  sandboxed  environment  that  isolate  each  other. 
Sometimes  these  securities  can  breakdown  allowing  attackers  to  escape  the  boundaries  of  this  sandboxed 
environment  and have  full  privileged  access to the host.  [4]  The Virtualization introduces  several security 
vulnerabilities like Cross – VM side channel attacks, virtual Network attacks, inadequate data deletion before 
memory is assigned to a different customer or “escape to the hypervisor where an attacker uses a guest virtual 
machine to attack vulnerabilities in hypervisor software. [4]
When a user uploads the input data to the cloud, the user’s data which is present in the unencrypted  form 
suffer  from  privacy  challenges.  [15]  The  strangers  over  the  cloud  need  to  establish  trust relationship.  Our 
objective is to protect a system by mitigating the effects of successful exploitation and to delimit the sensible 
boundaries  of  the  system.  It  is  necessary  to  manage  such  type  of  risks  intelligently  by  incorporating 
additional modules into the CSP’s site thereby the perspective of protecting local data can be attained. These 
modules are responsible for analyzing the unknown binaries by verifying the source code and data file of the 
client.

III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  
This  paper  has  addressed  the  issues  in  establishment  of  Trust  at  different  levels.  The  objective  of  the 
proposed  system  is  to  establish  a  trusted  cloud  computing  platform  for  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity  of  computations  without  Data  Loss  or  leakage.  Trust  Assessment  policy  manager  in  the  cloud
computing services is introduced to enhance the usability of Cloud without fear of adoption in sharing their 
resources to be a part of the cloud. Its main aim is to build up a trust between the end user and the cloud. This 
paper has introduced a Trust assessment module to ensure trust by assessing the job that includes source code 
or  executables  and  data that  is  submitted  by  the  end  user  for  sharing  computational  resources  in  Cloud 
(Figure 4).

A.  Description of Trust Assessment Module  [TAM]
We  present  the  Trust  Assessment  Module  that  provides  a  jailed  (Closed  Box)  Application  execution 
environment for the users with the limited privileges for utilizing the cloud computational resources.(Figure 
5) The cloud user submits the job may be unknown to the host running the job. If the job carries a virus/worm 
it will destroy the data in the local file system. It is called Data protection issue. The CSP needs to implement 
the routines to check before handling the application / code in order to ensure if there is any malicious lines 
of code or malware is present or not. Primarily the job which consists of data and source code are sent by the 
cloud user to Trust assessment Module. Request handler is designed to handle every request from the remote 
client and send the request along with the job to the Authorization engine.  The authorization engine checks 
the client’s requirement with the Service  provider’s description in order to check if the requestor complies 
with  provider’s  policy.  On  assessing  if  it  complies  the  job  is  sent  to  the  Trust  Evaluator  Module  present 
within the Trust Assessment Module. The  trust negotiation process  consists  of  verification in three  stages. 
They are 1. The job is verified for its integrity. This is done in order to ensure if there is any  modification 
made in  the  middle by  performing Man-in-the-Middle attack. 2.  Check if the files  submitted  by the client 
contain any virus signatures or Trojan horse. This is done by utilizing the Third party Antivirus toolkits with 
its latest patch updated automatically. 3. Ensure whether the code has any unauthorized privileged operation 
which is not explicitly specified  at the time of Job submission in  Service  Level Agreement. On successful 
verification of all the three stages the Job status is updated as “READY” or “CANCELLED”.

Figure 5. Design of Trust Assessment Module

When  the  status  of  the  job  is  updated  as  “READY”  the job  is  redirected  by  the  trust  evaluator  to  the  Job 
scheduler.  The  job  scheduler  is  an  interface  which interconnects  the  proposed  work  to  the  existing  cloud 
where  Globus[21] is  used.  In  this  paper  we  have  focused  in  the  lower  layer  of  IaaS.  Trust  Assessment 
Module (TAM) is used to establish the mutual trust between the client and the virtual machine in the most 
trusted  private  cloud. Client’s  policies  are  sent  by  job scheduler  to  a  Policy  Enforcement  Point  (PEM)  of 
remote  private  cloud  which  contains  policies  of  each  Virtual Machine  (VM)  in  that  Virtual  Organization.
Functionalities such as  crosschecking the  policies and accessing the information handed  over  by the  Trust 
Manager with each virtual machine policies are done by the Policy Enforcement Module. If the policies of 
client  are  satisfied,  then  all  its  client  related  policies  are  handed  over  to  the  CSP.  The  proposed  system 
ensures that the job does not contain any threats which may cause risk of data theft or corrupting the data. 
The data thieves break in to the provider’s machine as though they are legitimate users. The objective of such 
user is either to steal the data / corrupt the data or to attack other customers of the same service if there is 
inadequate separation  of different customers.  In  order to prevent such  vulnerability the proposed system is 
incorporated  with  the  additional  feature  of  Privilege  Separation.  The  Privilege  Separation  is  to  reduce  as 
much as possible the amount of code that runs with full privileges. For each job submitted to the compute 
cloud by the user, the principle of least privilege is applied to the whole system. Each user is allocated the 
smallest  set  of  privileges  necessary  to  perform  the  tasks  he  or  she  needs  to  accomplish  the  execution  of 
remote Job.

B.  Implementation and Testing 

The proposed system is implemented in two modules viz. the TAM and the Privilege Separation Module at 
the Resource. The TAM is implemented using JAVA and Privilege separation module is implemented using
Shell programming.  Privilege Separation module is designed  and implemented for two different operating 
systems Linux and Windows. The privilege separation module is loaded on every resource which is a part of 
the private cloud.. The  user friendly interface is designed  and implemented using PHP  and it is interfaced 
with the GT4 and Aneka software to setup a cloud. The test bed is created by utilizing five workstations with 
the  configurations  of  Intel  Core  2  Duo  Processor  with  2  GB  RAM  and  500  GB  HDD  interconnected  by 
10/100 Mbps CAT-5 Ethernet cable. The operating system Linux and Windows 2000 is installed on it with 
the installation of Aneka in 2 nodes and GT4 on 3 nodes in which a single node acts as a Master Node and 2

1) Request Handler
A protocol socket is used in order to connect the end user with TAM. It consists of a listener process which is 
listening to port number 7000.  The cloud users can contact the cloud by accessing the user friendly interface. 
By  using  this  port  number  any  number  of  users  can  be  connected  to  the  TAM  module.  Any  user  who is 
interested to use the cloud as IaaS needs to access this user friendly portal in order to submit the job. The user 
submits the Source Code/ Executable file and Data File through this portal and furnishes his/her platform and 
resource  requirement.  Platform  includes  the  type  of  operating  system  and  resource  include  what  type  of
processor and other details about the approximate Cost estimation for resource utilization and time deadline 
for job execution. Before it is uploaded the Message digest is computed for the job and it is attached to the 
uploaded files. 
2) Authorization Engine
On receiving the job  and the Service level requirements  from the user it accesses the  policies  from Cloud 
Security policy database in order to match the requirement of the service consumer with that of the service 
provider’s.  In case if there is no match the request will not be accepted and forwarded to the Trust evaluator 
else it is forwarded to the trust evaluator (Figure 6).

Figure 7. Sequence of Operations involved in the Cloud Execution Module 

3) Trust Evaluator 
When this module is invoked by TAM it enters into code and data verification phase. This phase constitutes 
of  three steps.  First  it  verifies  the  integrity  of  the  job  to  check  if  any  attack  is  made  while  uploading  and
transferring  of  files  takes  place.  We  have  used  MD5  (Message  Digest  5)  algorithm  in  order  to  verify  the 
integrity of the files. The second step of verification continues  only if the outcome of  first step is matched 
else the job is discarded. Then if it matches the files are scanned using two tools like Norton Antivirus toolkit 
and Anubis Malware Analysis tool to check whether it includes Viruses, worms, and Trojans, spyware and 
track ware. When any set of files crosses all the above mentioned three stages successfully it is handed over 
to the Job Scheduler (Figure 7).
4) Job Scheduler 
The job scheduler is designed in such a way that it is properly interfaced with the Job submission module of 
the respective tools. Here in our work we have tested using Globus Toolkit and Aneka. In globus toolkit shell 
scripts are used for submitting the jobs through the portal. The shell scripts call client interfaces in GRAM 
for job submission. They are globus_job_submit, globusrun, globus_job_run, globus_job_get_output. 
5) Privilege Separation Module 
This module is deployed in all the resources which are part of the cloud infrastructure. This is essential in 
cloud  to  handle  the  data  protection  issue.    Here  we  have  used  Application  level  sandboxing  technique  to 
protect completely from unauthorized penetration into local file system of a resource. It is a technique that 
sandboxes the application to prevent them  from accessing data and memory based on certain policies. It is 
done through the use of proof carrying code (PCC) where the code generator generate proof of application 
safeness and embed this in compiled code. In addition to this a fool proof environment is created in Linux 
based systems by using open source project jailkit-2.0 written by Olivier Sessink in order to prevent the code 
from entering into super user mode thereby it completely inhibits the system from any kind of unauthorized 
access [Figure 7]. (Jailkit is an open source project written by Olivier Sessink. It is released under a modified 
BSD license).

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We  have  proposed  a  reliability  analysis  procedure  for  compute  cloud  environments  from  the  Resource 
provider’s point of view. The reliability analysis is performed in two stages. First the application is verified 
for  malicious  code  and  if  it  is  found  to  be  trustworthy  then  a  sand  boxing  is  performed.  The  privilege 
separation  environment  is  created  for  its  successful  execution.  On  completion  the  user’s  trace  and 
corresponding files which is stored in a separate directory is completely removed. A trust assessment module 
has been designed as a detective control which is used to identify the occurrence of privacy risk that violate 
the  security  policies  of  the  system  is  described  along  with  its  practical  feasibility.  The  proposed  work  is 
tested under Aneka and Globus Toolkit middleware. Integration of the proposed work with Xen is in process.

Abstract— Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access 
to  a  shared  pool  of configurable  computing  resources. Reliability  in  compute  cloud  is  an 
important  aspect in Quality of Service which needs  to be addressed in  order to foster the 
adoption  of  compute  cloud.  In  today’s  integrated  environment  the  distributed  systems  is 
employed  to  carry  out  computational  intensive  task  at  a  faster  rate  without  much 
investment. The Cloud is a multitenant architecture which allows faster computation with 
high scalability at a lower cost thereby the users can share the same physical infrastructure. 
Individual customers deploy their applications in such environment will occupy the virtual 
partitions on the platform. This paper describes a straightforward procedure to analyze the 
reliability  of  the  application  from  the  view  point  of  the  resource  provider.  A  trust 
component is implemented to provide preventive control and to mitigate the occurrence of 
any non-permissible action by using the detective mechanism. Such mechanisms are used to 
identify the privacy risk and it further prevents from utilization. Hence, in this paper trust 
assessment is performed before the user is allowed to share the multitenant infrastructure. 
The cloud can provide scalable and reliable service for the legitimate users. The proposed 
work is tested using tools Aneka and Globus Toolkit.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cloud  computing  is  a  distributed  and  parallel  system  which  consists  of  a  collection  of  virtualized,  inter-
connected,  dynamically  provisioned  and  unified  computing  resources  which  is  based  on  service-level 
agreements that can be established through negotiation between the consumer and the service provider. The 
main  aim  of  a  distributed  computing  system  is  to  connect  users  and  share  IT  resources  in  an  open, 
transparent, cost-effective, reliable, scalable and secure way. Two main factors in cloud computing are cost 
and security. Outsourcing the computation tasks eliminates a significant amount of intervention time from the 
users  or  system  managers  required  for  the  installation,  configuration,  updating  and  removal  of  complex 
computer systems. The cloud of computer grids provides such services on fee-based, which can be more cost-
efficient  for the users than  purchasing, maintaining,  and upgrading  powerful servers. The  major issue with 
computational  cloud has  been its security.  The  apps written for the cloud always have  to be secure use  of 
cloud computing their own terms because they don’t automatically grant security compliance for the end-user 
data or apps on them. Even though cloud vendors deal with some of the responsibilities, application designer 
has the major responsibility. Studies made by Symantec, Gartner and others revealed that majority of attacks

on  IT  enterprises  today  occur  at  the  application  layer  and  are  remotely  exploitable.  The  Cloud  Security 
Alliance has recognized top threats to cloud computing are [1]

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  technique  to  mitigate  the  problems  of  3,  4  and  5.  This  paper  proposes  a  trust 
assessment policy manager for cloud computing that is intended to control mutual policy management for the 
purpose  of  resource  utilization  thereby  it  removes  the  barrier  to  fear  of  provisioning  /  utilizing  the 
computational resources in the cloud.
Cloud relies on Grid Infrastructure which consists of grid nodes and communication network. Grid system is 
a mechanism to pool resources on-demand to improve the overall utilization of the system. Hence, it need to 
be monitored for various reasons like Utilization of resources, managing trust between systems and strangers, 
and authorization given to the users to access certain set of resources. Issues in such system are classified into 
three  categories  a.  Architecture  related  issues  b.  Infrastructure  related  issues  and  c.  Management  related 
issues. Since grid is heterogeneous in nature which consists of multiple entities or components, domains and 
policies and stake holders the  key challenge is managing trust and credentials. Trust management is highly 
crucial in dynamic grid because the grid nodes and users join and leave the system. The host is apprehensive 
to  be  a  part  of  the  system  since  it  suffers  from  two  drawbacks  Data  Protection  and Job  starvation.  Cloud 
utilizes this infrastructure to provide various types of services like Infrastructure, Platform and Software in 
the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
shown in  Fig.1. In  IaaS the computing resources including virtual  machines and other abstracted hardware 
and operating systems are delivered as a service in which the resources are managed through a service API. 
The customer rents these resources instead of buying them for their computation need ex. Amazon EC2, S3 
[2]. In PaaS the entire platform includes solution stack for software development and life cycle management 
software which can be accessed by the customers to develop new applications Ex. Google App Engine and 
Force.com [2]. In SaaS the applications are developed as a service which is utilized on-demand and pay for 
on  a  per-use  basis  [4].  The  main  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  our  trusted  system 
architecture  for  cloud  computing  solutions. It  aims  at  supporting  cloud  service  provider  to  identify 
trustworthy service consumer as well as non trustworthy consumer.

Figure 1. The Models of Cloud Service

A.  Types of Trust and Trust Levels
There  are  various  trust  levels  in  Cloud.  Out  of  five  different  levels  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  2,  we  have 
chosen the last level of trust. There are different types of trust which includes direct trust, indirect trust, full 

 
47

trust, partial trust,  recommended  trust,  authentication trust, privacy trust, Execution trust and code trust. In 
Service  oriented  grid  environment  two  types  of  trust  Execution  trust  and  Code  trust  is  considered  in  this 
proposed work. The execution trust exist from subject’s side to service provider’s side i.e. the consumer trust 
the  Service  Provider  and  the  environment  for  executing  the  task  .    The  service  provider  has  to  correctly 
allocate resources for the efficient execution of Jobs [2]. The code trust exists from service provider’s side to
subject’s side. The service provider has to trust the subject by checking if the code is free  from  viruses or
Trojan horses such that it should not produce malicious results or corrupt the data in the local file system.

Figure 2. Levels of Trust in Cloud Computing.[2]

 

Hence the subject should present Reliable Virus free code which does not produce malicious result since it 
may tamper the results/code/data present at the Service Providers end. [3]. Our objective is to develop a trust 
management service to incorporate code trust and privacy trust for the compute cloud.

II. RELATED WORK 
A.  Trust Assessment and Estabilishment Techniques 
Miranda  Mowbray et.al,  described  a  privacy  manager  for  cloud  computing  that  controls  policy-based 
obfuscation  and  de-obfuscation  of  personal,  sensitive,  or  confidential  data  within  cloud  service  provision. 
The privacy manager uses a feature called obfuscation. The idea is that instead of being present unencrypted 
in  the  cloud,  the  user’s  private  data  should  be  sent  to  the  cloud  in  an  encrypted  form,  and  the  processing 
needs to be done on the encrypted data. The output of the processing is deobfuscated by the privacy manager 
to reveal the correct result [5].
Zou  D  et.al,  explained  an  important  method  called  Automated  Trust  Negotiation  (ATN)  to  establish  trust 
relationship between two strangers by exchanging their access control policies and credentials.  To ease the 
burden  on  the  administrator  during  deploying  ATN  access  control  policies  and  credentials  in  virtual 
computing environment, automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation 
(VATN) was proposed to centralize Automated Trust Negotiation policies and credentials for multiple virtual 
machines  in  a  physical  node  into  a  privileged  virtual  machine.  Thus  VATN  could  be  used  to  centralize
negotiation  policies,  local  access  control  policies,  and  credentials  in  a  privileged  VM  on  a  physical  node 
[6][14][17][18]. Winsborough focused on the memory complexity of various ATN strategies. [16] 
Marco Casassa Mont et.al, explained about an approach based on a privacy-aware access control model. This 
model extends traditional access control model by explicitly dealing with the stated purposes for which data 
is collected, checking at the access request time the Intent of requestors against these purposes, dealing with 
data  subjects’  consent  and  enforcing  additional  access  conditions  and  constraints  defined  by  data  subjects 
and/or enterprise administrators [7] 
Casassa Mont M et.al, described about a suite of privacy technologies that have been developed by HP Labs, 
in an integrated way, to help enterprises to  automate the  management and enforcement of privacy  policies 
(including privacy obligations) and the process of checking such policies and legislation are indeed complied 
with [8].
Ryan  K  L  Ko  et.al,  discusses  key  challenges  in  achieving  a  trusted  cloud  through  the  use  of  detective 
controls,  and  presents  the  Trust  Cloud  framework,  which  addresses  accountability  in  cloud  computing  via 
technical and policy based approaches. This paper establishes the urgent need for research in accountability 

 
48

in the cloud and outlines the risks of not achieving it. They have proposed a detective rather than preventive 
approaches to increasing accountability. [9] 
Pearson S et.al, described about securing the information transferred in distributed computing environments. 
Personal and confidential information is stored on a wide variety of enterprise data resources. To secure and 
protect  this  data,  technology  must  adapt  to  mitigate  the  threats  and  risks  arising  from  the  trend  towards 
dynamic enterprises, adaptive data centers, and on-demand resource allocation. [10] 
In protection of identity information in cloud computing without trusted third party, cloud computing allows 
the  use  of  Internet-based  services  to  support  business  processes  and  rental  of  IT-services  on  a  utility-like 
basis. It offers a concentration of resources but also poses risks for data privacy. Identity management (IDM) 
is  one  of  the  core  components  in  cloud  privacy  and  security  and  can  help  alleviate  some  of  the  problems 
associated with cloud computing. [11] Haines presents a comprehensive to risk management. [13] 
Extensive sharing of computing resources can be done using cloud infrastructure. The risk is varied upon the 
deployment model. Vulnerability is very high when a cloud is utilized as IaaS. The consumer of IaaS needs 
to build in security as they are primarily responsible for it. There is a risk to the data stored in the machine 
which is the part of a cloud when user submits a job with a malicious code. Such environment needs to be 
protected from both intrusions and execution of malicious code.
Sarah Kim and Ayoung had explored the factors that affect the formation of trust or distrust on cloud services 
and Cloud Service Provider CSP from the perspective of ordinary individual user [12]. If such ordinary users 
are  engaged  with  Cloud  services  in  their  everyday  life  for  various  purposes  there  are  certain  set  of 
customized users who engage with cloud computing to consume IaaS faces different type of threat which is 
neither  identified  nor  focused.  The  obfuscation  feature  of  the  privacy  manager  is  not  suitable  for  cloud 
applications. [19]
B.  Threats and Vulnerability 
Analyzing Risk is more important while adopting Cloud Concepts. Risk provides both opportunity and peril.

Figure 3. Cloud risk relative to other security concerns[2]

The general purpose software is being used within the cloud computing environment without addressing the 
fundamental  risk  associated  to  this  new  technology.  The  consequence  of  migrating  towards  the  existing 
software  infrastructure  to  cloud  increases  the  risk  of  organizational data.  Hence  organization  needs  to 
accommodate the changes in the software stack. According to the detailed analysis made in previous section,
focuses on the formation of trust or distrust for cloud services and CSP identified during the initial analysis 
correspond to trust building made for information systems and e-commerce. The analysis is with respect to 
ordinary users. In general even though cloud storage can be more at risk from malicious behavior recently 
performing higher computational intensive task in cloud also introduces lot of exposure for a long period of 
time  and  risk  from  malicious  behaviors.  There  are  another  category  of  users  who  uses  the  IaaS  on  cloud 
where their computations will be done on different CSPs. The fear of utilizing such cloud service is analyzed 
with respect to two different perspectives – Resource Provider and Resource Consumer. There is a chance for 
security breach if the cloud consumer (Resource consumer) is a hacker or disgruntled employee. She/he tries 
to exploit local data or to attack the cloud resource thereby an organization is exposed to potential loss and 

 
49

liability. Exploit based attacks have been popular in the past two decades. With reference to Fig. 3, there is a 
need for a solution to prevent general threats and data loss prevention.
In resource providers perspective there are various threats that may cause damage to the data or loss of data 
that are kept in the local  file system. A skilled exploit always try to lead the  application to a  known state 
during the preparatory phase of the attack. The attacker can force an application to take a specific path that 
will  lead  to  a  specific  request  or  set  of  requests.  On  executing  such  set  of  requests  for  multiple  times  an 
attacker can gather more and more information to predict the exact layout of the file system. For an example 
the usage model of the application running on a system may attempt to open a lower TCP or UDP ports (1 –
1023)  and  deleting  a  user  from  the  system  are  two  common  privileged  operations  and  both  of  these 
operations have to be carried out with super-user privileges. Such vulnerability of an application would give 
an  attacker  full  control  over  the  system  where  the  computation  is  being  carried  on.  In  addition  to  this  the 
kernel keeps track of process details such as what files it opened, its security credentials and what memory 
ranges it is using. On being able to successfully locate the structures that hold these details is the first step in 
kernel shell code development. On accessing the structure that holds the credentials for the running process 
the user can raise his privileges / capabilities. [20]
Multi tenancy is an architectural feature whereby single instance of software runs on a cloud vendor’s servers 
serving  multiple  client  organization.  In  IaaS  model  different  customers  are  users  of  resources  in  CSP’s 
servers. It is the responsibility of the CSP to isolate each user and to secure the secrecy of the data. There is a 
threat to the mechanisms sometimes if any of the tenants could get the privilege of super-user status thereby 
gaining the access of file system and other information.
The  CSP  uses  Meta  Scheduler  and  resource  management  to  schedule  the  job  or  uses  virtualization  to 
maximize  the  Hardware  utilization.  Virtual  machines  are  sandboxed  environment  that  isolate  each  other. 
Sometimes  these  securities  can  breakdown  allowing  attackers  to  escape  the  boundaries  of  this  sandboxed 
environment  and have  full  privileged  access to the host.  [4]  The Virtualization introduces  several security 
vulnerabilities like Cross – VM side channel attacks, virtual Network attacks, inadequate data deletion before 
memory is assigned to a different customer or “escape to the hypervisor where an attacker uses a guest virtual 
machine to attack vulnerabilities in hypervisor software. [4]
When a user uploads the input data to the cloud, the user’s data which is present in the unencrypted  form 
suffer  from  privacy  challenges.  [15]  The  strangers  over  the  cloud  need  to  establish  trust relationship.  Our 
objective is to protect a system by mitigating the effects of successful exploitation and to delimit the sensible 
boundaries  of  the  system.  It  is  necessary  to  manage  such  type  of  risks  intelligently  by  incorporating 
additional modules into the CSP’s site thereby the perspective of protecting local data can be attained. These 
modules are responsible for analyzing the unknown binaries by verifying the source code and data file of the 
client.

III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  
This  paper  has  addressed  the  issues  in  establishment  of  Trust  at  different  levels.  The  objective  of  the 
proposed  system  is  to  establish  a  trusted  cloud  computing  platform  for  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity  of  computations  without  Data  Loss  or  leakage.  Trust  Assessment  policy  manager  in  the  cloud
computing services is introduced to enhance the usability of Cloud without fear of adoption in sharing their 
resources to be a part of the cloud. Its main aim is to build up a trust between the end user and the cloud. This 
paper has introduced a Trust assessment module to ensure trust by assessing the job that includes source code 
or  executables  and  data that  is  submitted  by  the  end  user  for  sharing  computational  resources  in  Cloud 
(Figure 4).

Figure 4. Overall Proposed System Design

A.  Description of Trust Assessment Module  [TAM]
We  present  the  Trust  Assessment  Module  that  provides  a  jailed  (Closed  Box)  Application  execution 
environment for the users with the limited privileges for utilizing the cloud computational resources.(Figure 
5) The cloud user submits the job may be unknown to the host running the job. If the job carries a virus/worm 
it will destroy the data in the local file system. It is called Data protection issue. The CSP needs to implement 
the routines to check before handling the application / code in order to ensure if there is any malicious lines 
of code or malware is present or not. Primarily the job which consists of data and source code are sent by the 
cloud user to Trust assessment Module. Request handler is designed to handle every request from the remote 
client and send the request along with the job to the Authorization engine.  The authorization engine checks 
the client’s requirement with the Service  provider’s description in order to check if the requestor complies 
with  provider’s  policy.  On  assessing  if  it  complies  the  job  is  sent  to  the  Trust  Evaluator  Module  present 
within the Trust Assessment Module. The  trust negotiation process  consists  of  verification in three  stages. 
They are 1. The job is verified for its integrity. This is done in order to ensure if there is any  modification 
made in  the  middle by  performing Man-in-the-Middle attack. 2.  Check if the files  submitted  by the client 
contain any virus signatures or Trojan horse. This is done by utilizing the Third party Antivirus toolkits with 
its latest patch updated automatically. 3. Ensure whether the code has any unauthorized privileged operation 
which is not explicitly specified  at the time of Job submission in  Service  Level Agreement. On successful 
verification of all the three stages the Job status is updated as “READY” or “CANCELLED”.

Figure 5. Design of Trust Assessment Module

When  the  status  of  the  job  is  updated  as  “READY”  the job  is  redirected  by  the  trust  evaluator  to  the  Job 
scheduler.  The  job  scheduler  is  an  interface  which interconnects  the  proposed  work  to  the  existing  cloud 
where  Globus[21] is  used.  In  this  paper  we  have  focused  in  the  lower  layer  of  IaaS.  Trust  Assessment 
Module (TAM) is used to establish the mutual trust between the client and the virtual machine in the most 
trusted  private  cloud. Client’s  policies  are  sent  by  job scheduler  to  a  Policy  Enforcement  Point  (PEM)  of 
remote  private  cloud  which  contains  policies  of  each  Virtual Machine  (VM)  in  that  Virtual  Organization.
Functionalities such as  crosschecking the  policies and accessing the information handed  over  by the  Trust 
Manager with each virtual machine policies are done by the Policy Enforcement Module. If the policies of 
client  are  satisfied,  then  all  its  client  related  policies  are  handed  over  to  the  CSP.  The  proposed  system 
ensures that the job does not contain any threats which may cause risk of data theft or corrupting the data. 
The data thieves break in to the provider’s machine as though they are legitimate users. The objective of such 
user is either to steal the data / corrupt the data or to attack other customers of the same service if there is 
inadequate separation  of different customers.  In  order to prevent such  vulnerability the proposed system is 
incorporated  with  the  additional  feature  of  Privilege  Separation.  The  Privilege  Separation  is  to  reduce  as 
much as possible the amount of code that runs with full privileges. For each job submitted to the compute 
cloud by the user, the principle of least privilege is applied to the whole system. Each user is allocated the 
smallest  set  of  privileges  necessary  to  perform  the  tasks  he  or  she  needs  to  accomplish  the  execution  of 
remote Job.

 
51

B.  Implementation and Testing 

The proposed system is implemented in two modules viz. the TAM and the Privilege Separation Module at 
the Resource. The TAM is implemented using JAVA and Privilege separation module is implemented using
Shell programming.  Privilege Separation module is designed  and implemented for two different operating 
systems Linux and Windows. The privilege separation module is loaded on every resource which is a part of 
the private cloud.. The  user friendly interface is designed  and implemented using PHP  and it is interfaced 
with the GT4 and Aneka software to setup a cloud. The test bed is created by utilizing five workstations with 
the  configurations  of  Intel  Core  2  Duo  Processor  with  2  GB  RAM  and  500  GB  HDD  interconnected  by 
10/100 Mbps CAT-5 Ethernet cable. The operating system Linux and Windows 2000 is installed on it with 
the installation of Aneka in 2 nodes and GT4 on 3 nodes in which a single node acts as a Master Node and 2 
nodes act as Compute Nodes.
1) Request Handler
A protocol socket is used in order to connect the end user with TAM. It consists of a listener process which is 
listening to port number 7000.  The cloud users can contact the cloud by accessing the user friendly interface. 
By  using  this  port  number  any  number  of  users  can  be  connected  to  the  TAM  module.  Any  user  who is 
interested to use the cloud as IaaS needs to access this user friendly portal in order to submit the job. The user 
submits the Source Code/ Executable file and Data File through this portal and furnishes his/her platform and 
resource  requirement.  Platform  includes  the  type  of  operating  system  and  resource  include  what  type  of
processor and other details about the approximate Cost estimation for resource utilization and time deadline 
for job execution. Before it is uploaded the Message digest is computed for the job and it is attached to the 
uploaded files. 
2) Authorization Engine
On receiving the job  and the Service level requirements  from the user it accesses the  policies  from Cloud 
Security policy database in order to match the requirement of the service consumer with that of the service 
provider’s.  In case if there is no match the request will not be accepted and forwarded to the Trust evaluator 
else it is forwarded to the trust evaluator (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Sequence of Operations involved in Trust Assessment Module

 
52

 

Figure 7. Sequence of Operations involved in the Cloud Execution Module 

3) Trust Evaluator 
When this module is invoked by TAM it enters into code and data verification phase. This phase constitutes 
of  three steps.  First  it  verifies  the  integrity  of  the  job  to  check  if  any  attack  is  made  while  uploading  and
transferring  of  files  takes  place.  We  have  used  MD5  (Message  Digest  5)  algorithm  in  order  to  verify  the 
integrity of the files. The second step of verification continues  only if the outcome of  first step is matched 
else the job is discarded. Then if it matches the files are scanned using two tools like Norton Antivirus toolkit 
and Anubis Malware Analysis tool to check whether it includes Viruses, worms, and Trojans, spyware and 
track ware. When any set of files crosses all the above mentioned three stages successfully it is handed over 
to the Job Scheduler (Figure 7).
4) Job Scheduler 
The job scheduler is designed in such a way that it is properly interfaced with the Job submission module of 
the respective tools. Here in our work we have tested using Globus Toolkit and Aneka. In globus toolkit shell 
scripts are used for submitting the jobs through the portal. The shell scripts call client interfaces in GRAM 
for job submission. They are globus_job_submit, globusrun, globus_job_run, globus_job_get_output. 
5) Privilege Separation Module 
This module is deployed in all the resources which are part of the cloud infrastructure. This is essential in 
cloud  to  handle  the  data  protection  issue.    Here  we  have  used  Application  level  sandboxing  technique  to 
protect completely from unauthorized penetration into local file system of a resource. It is a technique that 
sandboxes the application to prevent them  from accessing data and memory based on certain policies. It is 
done through the use of proof carrying code (PCC) where the code generator generate proof of application 
safeness and embed this in compiled code. In addition to this a fool proof environment is created in Linux 
based systems by using open source project jailkit-2.0 written by Olivier Sessink in order to prevent the code 
from entering into super user mode thereby it completely inhibits the system from any kind of unauthorized 
access [Figure 7]. (Jailkit is an open source project written by Olivier Sessink. It is released under a modified 
BSD license).

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We  have  proposed  a  reliability  analysis  procedure  for  compute  cloud  environments  from  the  Resource 
provider’s point of view. The reliability analysis is performed in two stages. First the application is verified 
for  malicious  code  and  if  it  is  found  to  be  trustworthy  then  a  sand  boxing  is  performed.  The  privilege 
separation  environment  is  created  for  its  successful  execution.  On  completion  the  user’s  trace  and 
corresponding files which is stored in a separate directory is completely removed. A trust assessment module 
has been designed as a detective control which is used to identify the occurrence of privacy risk that violate 
the  security  policies  of  the  system  is  described  along  with  its  practical  feasibility.  The  proposed  work  is 
tested under Aneka and Globus Toolkit middleware. Integration of the proposed work with Xen is in process.
