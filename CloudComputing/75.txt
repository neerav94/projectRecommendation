Abstract:  cloud  computing  provides  an  on  demand,  self  service,  rapid,  elastic  and  ubiquitous  access  to  various  computing 

resources. Deduplication is the process of reducing redundancy of data storage services provided by the cloud computing by 

keeping a single copy of any file in spite of ‘n’ number of users of the file. Users are provided with the link to the file and 

only a single copy is stored at the server. 

However, as Deduplication emerges as an answer to the increased demand of storage services in the cloud infrastructures, it 

introduces the vulnerability of side channel attacks due to cross user deduplication. 

This  paper  reviews  and  analyses  various  attacks  related  to  deduplication  and  the  techniques  proposed  to  overcome  those 

attacks. It has been observed that in spite of various solutions provided, deduplication still suffers from the vulnerability of 

one or the other side  channel attack.  Hence  in this paper we propose a solution  which helps to reduce the vulnerability of 

several  side  channel  attacks  while  keeping  the  essence  of  deduplication  alive.  Also  it  helps  to  establish  trust  between  the 

cloud storage provider and user.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing, in addition to other services provides various infrastructures as service. Storage-as-a-service is one of the 

most  important  and  widely  used  infrastructures  provided  by  cloud  computing  technology.  With  the  increasing  demand  of 

computers and other computer based services, the demand for data storage is also increasing day by day. In this scenario cloud 

computing offers best solutions for rapid, elastic, reliable, and measured storage 7... 

The  increasing demand  of  cloud storage requirement  has  led to the process  of deduplication. The term data deduplication 

refers to techniques that store only a single copy of redundant data, and provide links to that copy instead of storing other actual 

copies  of  this  data  1..  The  deduplication  process  is  used  to  protect  the  cloud  server  from  storing  redundant  data.  If  two  users 

want to upload the same file, only a single file will be uploaded on the cloud server and the users will be provided with a link 

that will fetch the whole file for them whenever they want to retrieve it. Suppose user1 on cloud stores a file A. He will request 

to upload the  file  and the  file will  be successfully  uploaded  now when a user, user2 will  upload the same  file,  the  cloud will 

deduplicate the file by providing user2 the link of file A, which is already present on the cloud.  Thus ‘n’ number of users can be 

allowed to access same file with a single copy stored on cloud.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing, in addition to other services provides various infrastructures as service. Storage-as-a-service is one of the 

most  important  and  widely  used  infrastructures  provided  by  cloud  computing  technology.  With  the  increasing  demand  of 

computers and other computer based services, the demand for data storage is also increasing day by day. In this scenario cloud 

computing offers best solutions for rapid, elastic, reliable, and measured storage 7... 

The  increasing demand  of  cloud storage requirement  has  led to the process  of deduplication. The term data deduplication 

refers to techniques that store only a single copy of redundant data, and provide links to that copy instead of storing other actual 

copies  of  this  data  1..  The  deduplication  process  is  used  to  protect  the  cloud  server  from  storing  redundant  data.  If  two  users

network bandwidth but this process give rise to a security problem in cloud computing, the side channel attack. The cross virtual 

machine users can use several attacks to find the confidential data related to each other as well as the administrator. Thus  cross 

user deduplication leads to the vulnerability of side channel attacks in cloud computing. 

   This  paper  reviews  various  attack  models  and  solutions  provided  for  the  deduplication  security.  Section  I  of  this  paper 

gives  a  brief  introduction  to  the  paper.  Section  II  reviews  several  attack  models  that  can  be  used  to  misuse  the  deduplicatio n 

technology.  In  section  III  various  solutions  proposed  have  been  reviewed  and  analysed  while  the  last  section  provides  our 

proposed solution to enhance the security of deduplication and establish a trust between the cloud provider and the cloud users 

while keeping the essence of deduplication. 

II. ATTACK MODELS 

Several  attack  models  have  been  discovered,  which  can  lead  to  the  exploitation  of  deduplication  towards  an  insecure 

storage  method.  However  looking  at  the  excellent  possibilities  of  enhancing  storage  efficiency,  several  solutions  have  been 

proposed. This section describes various attack models. The first attack can be used to predict an already known file possessed 

by the user. The second attack is related to creating a secret channel for extracting information while the third attack is related to 

distribution of any file among various users of cloud storage. 

A.  Attack Model I: Predicting files 

This attack can be used to predict whether a particular file is possessed by a specific user 1.. Furthermore this attack can  be 

more  efficiently  used  to  predict  a  file  if  the  file  contains  data  with  limited  possibilities  for  example  yes  or  no  in  case  of  a 

medical test report. Suppose the attacker wants to find out whether user1 possesses a file, File A. He will upload a copy of file A 

if the file gets uploaded this will indicate that the file is not possessed by  the user1. Whereas in the other case the attacker will 

be  able  to  find  out  if  the  file  is  possessed  by  user1.  Also,  in  order  to  hide  his  identity  as  an  attacker  he  will  terminate  the 

connection as soon as the file uploading starts.  

B.  Attack Model II: Creating a secret channel 

If the attacker manages to install any malicious software on the machine of user1, this software can be used to establish a 

secret channel between the user1 and the attacker 1.. There are several ways of creating this type of channel one of them is to 

bypass  the  firewall  and  communicate  with  its  control  server.    Consider  this  example;  suppose  user1  is  using  the  system  with 

malicious software installed, the software will generate two files in two different conditions. When user1 will backup his files 

on control server this file will be stored on the server. Now, attacker can easily use the attack described in previous section to 

find which file was stored by the software. This attack can use any number of conditional files, and thus can be very harmful as 

well as undetectable.   

C.  Attack Model III: The Content Distribution Attack 

The content distribution attack can be used to distribute a specific file to various users without providing the identity of  the 

distributor. The type of file can be a bootlegged video or a file containing a virus etc. 

The users in deduplication are enabled to use a file if they are included in the access control list of the file. The access  to a 

file is gained through a hash, h(F) where F is the file discussed above and the h(F) is the hash value corresponding to the file F, 

calculated by the control server. The attacker can get h(F) by uploading the required file and distribute it to the several users in 

order to let them access the file.

III. ANALYSIS OF SOLUTIONS 

The attacks described above present the various security threats while using cross user deduplication, However looking at 

the  storage  savings  provided  by  deduplication  it  is  impossible  to  neglect  deduplication  in  cloud  storage  solutions.  The 

deduplication  can  provide  90%  savings  for  network  bandwidth  as  well  as  the  disk  space  6...Therefore  a  number  of  solutions 

have been proposed by various researchers in this regard. These solutions have been discussed in detail in this section. 

A.  Encrypting files before uploading 

The attacks described above come into existence because of cross user deduplication, if the sensitive files will be encrypted 

before uploading them to the cloud, this will result in avoiding deduplication and hence none of the attacks will be possible. The 

files can be encrypted by the private key of the user. This key should not be disclosed and should be kept personal by each and 

every  user.  However  this  leads  to  the  problem  of  dictionary  attack.  The  private  key  of  any  user  is  vulnerable  to  offline  

dictionary  attacks.  Also  if  two  users  by  accident  use  same  private  key  then  deduplication  will  still  occur.  Another  problem 

related  with  this  option  is  regarding  the  generation  of  the  personal  key  and  the  bookkeeping  task  for  example  that  if  a  user 

forgets his personal key. The previous research on deduplication proposed a “convergent encryption” this type of encryption is 

capable of generating identical encrypted files from original files even when the users use different personal keys. This method 

keeps the essence of deduplication while providing a good level of security. 3. 

B.  Performing target based deduplication. 

Target  based  deduplication  performs  deduplication  at  the  server  side  rather  than  the  client  side.  This  method  however 

provides the security at the risk of network and bandwidth savings. 

C.  Randomisation 

Randomisation solution was proposed in 1.. This method assigns a number named as, a random threshold to every file. The 

file is not deduplicated until the number of users of the file reach to the threshold. After the number of users of file increases the 

threshold, the deduplication takes place. The biggest loophole of this method is that the threshold is chosen uniformly at random 

thus lacking reliability.   

D.  Proof of ownership 

This  method  uses  block  level  deduplication,  this  process  divides  the  file  into  fixed  or  variable  size  blocks  before 

deduplicating them. In this method, the user needs to provide the proof that he owns the particular file. Suppose user 1 uploads a 

file A. This file will be first divided into number of blocks B, each block will be stored corresponding to a particular index I and 

then stored at the server. Now if user 2 uploads the same file the server will ask the user to prove that he is the real owner of the 

file. For this the server will  ask the user to send a  particular block B(x) corresponding to a specific  index  I(x) where x  is any 

random number corresponding to the number of blocks. If user 2 satisfies the challenge he is added to the access control list of 

the  file  and  in  other  case  the  request  is  not  granted.  However  this  method  reduces  the  chances  of  certain  attacks  like  content 

distribution, it suffers from the problem of probing attack 1... 

E.  Gateway based deduplication 

This method aims to provide transparency to the users and hence the attacker 4.. The gateway acts as a common terminal 

for  all  the  networks  providing  residential  internet  access.  The  abstract  view  of  this  method  is  shown  in  figure  1  4..  All  the 

upload and download requests of users of cloud storage service are handled by the gateway itself. As shown in the figure below 

there  are  five  different  modules  of  the  gateway,  SSP  (storage  service  provider),  gateway  server,  gateway  client,  bandwidth 

manager and the user client. When user client wishes to upload a file from user PC, it sends a request from its home network to 

the gateway server. Since the deduplication does not take place at the client side, the user is now free to proceed with his other 

tasks.  The  gateway  server  handles  the  file  to  the  gateway  client.  The  job  of  gateway  client  is  to  check  with  SSP  weather  the

Abstract:  cloud  computing  provides  an  on  demand,  self  service,  rapid,  elastic  and  ubiquitous  access  to  various  computing 

resources. Deduplication is the process of reducing redundancy of data storage services provided by the cloud computing by 

keeping a single copy of any file in spite of ‘n’ number of users of the file. Users are provided with the link to the file and 

only a single copy is stored at the server. 

However, as Deduplication emerges as an answer to the increased demand of storage services in the cloud infrastructures, it 

introduces the vulnerability of side channel attacks due to cross user deduplication. 

This  paper  reviews  and  analyses  various  attacks  related  to  deduplication  and  the  techniques  proposed  to  overcome  those

several  side  channel  attacks  while  keeping  the  essence  of  deduplication  alive.  Also  it  helps  to  establish  trust  between  the 

cloud storage provider and user.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing, in addition to other services provides various infrastructures as service. Storage-as-a-service is one of the 

most  important  and  widely  used  infrastructures  provided  by  cloud  computing  technology.  With  the  increasing  demand  of 

computers and other computer based services, the demand for data storage is also increasing day by day. In this scenario cloud 

computing offers best solutions for rapid, elastic, reliable, and measured storage 7... 

The  increasing demand  of  cloud storage requirement  has  led to the process  of deduplication. The term data deduplication 

refers to techniques that store only a single copy of redundant data, and provide links to that copy instead of storing other actual 

copies  of  this  data  1..  The  deduplication  process  is  used  to  protect  the  cloud  server  from  storing  redundant  data.  If  two  users 

want to upload the same file, only a single file will be uploaded on the cloud server and the users will be provided with a link 

that will fetch the whole file for them whenever they want to retrieve it. Suppose user1 on cloud stores a file A. He will request 

to upload the  file  and the  file will  be successfully  uploaded  now when a user, user2 will  upload the same  file,  the  cloud will 

deduplicate the file by providing user2 the link of file A, which is already present on the cloud.  Thus ‘n’ number of users can be 

allowed to access same file with a single copy stored on cloud.  

   The deduplication can be performed on the cloud server. If the whole file is first transferred to the cloud server before any 

deduplication, this is server-based approach for deduplication. This process saves the storage space in above mentioned way but 

the  network  bandwidth  for  sending  the  redundant  data  is  wasted.  Thus  client  side  deduplication  is  used  to  save  network 

bandwidth  as  well  as  storage  space.  However  the  deduplication  process  has  the  capability  to  save  both  storage  space  and

network bandwidth but this process give rise to a security problem in cloud computing, the side channel attack. The cross virtual 

machine users can use several attacks to find the confidential data related to each other as well as the administrator. Thus  cross 

user deduplication leads to the vulnerability of side channel attacks in cloud computing. 

   This  paper  reviews  various  attack  models  and  solutions  provided  for  the  deduplication  security.  Section  I  of  this  paper 

gives  a  brief  introduction  to  the  paper.  Section  II  reviews  several  attack  models  that  can  be  used  to  misuse  the  deduplicatio n 

technology.  In  section  III  various  solutions  proposed  have  been  reviewed  and  analysed  while  the  last  section  provides  our 

proposed solution to enhance the security of deduplication and establish a trust between the cloud provider and the cloud users 

while keeping the essence of deduplication. 

II. ATTACK MODELS 

Several  attack  models  have  been  discovered,  which  can  lead  to  the  exploitation  of  deduplication  towards  an  insecure 

storage  method.  However  looking  at  the  excellent  possibilities  of  enhancing  storage  efficiency,  several  solutions  have  been 

proposed. This section describes various attack models. The first attack can be used to predict an already known file possessed 

by the user. The second attack is related to creating a secret channel for extracting information while the third attack is related to 

distribution of any file among various users of cloud storage. 

A.  Attack Model I: Predicting files 

This attack can be used to predict whether a particular file is possessed by a specific user 1.. Furthermore this attack can  be 

more  efficiently  used  to  predict  a  file  if  the  file  contains  data  with  limited  possibilities  for  example  yes  or  no  in  case  of  a 

medical test report. Suppose the attacker wants to find out whether user1 possesses a file, File A. He will upload a copy of file A 

if the file gets uploaded this will indicate that the file is not possessed by  the user1. Whereas in the other case the attacker will 

be  able  to  find  out  if  the  file  is  possessed  by  user1.  Also,  in  order  to  hide  his  identity  as  an  attacker  he  will  terminate  the 

connection as soon as the file uploading starts.  

B.  Attack Model II: Creating a secret channel 

If the attacker manages to install any malicious software on the machine of user1, this software can be used to establish a 

secret channel between the user1 and the attacker 1.. There are several ways of creating this type of channel one of them is to 

bypass  the  firewall  and  communicate  with  its  control  server.    Consider  this  example;  suppose  user1  is  using  the  system  with 

malicious software installed, the software will generate two files in two different conditions. When user1 will backup his files 

on control server this file will be stored on the server. Now, attacker can easily use the attack described in previous section to 

find which file was stored by the software. This attack can use any number of conditional files, and thus can be very harmful as 

well as undetectable.   

C.  Attack Model III: The Content Distribution Attack 

The content distribution attack can be used to distribute a specific file to various users without providing the identity of  the 

distributor. The type of file can be a bootlegged video or a file containing a virus etc. 

The users in deduplication are enabled to use a file if they are included in the access control list of the file. The access  to a 

file is gained through a hash, h(F) where F is the file discussed above and the h(F) is the hash value corresponding to the file F, 

calculated by the control server. The attacker can get h(F) by uploading the required file and distribute it to the several users in 

order to let them access the file.

III. ANALYSIS OF SOLUTIONS 

The attacks described above present the various security threats while using cross user deduplication, However looking at 

the  storage  savings  provided  by  deduplication  it  is  impossible  to  neglect  deduplication  in  cloud  storage  solutions.  The 

deduplication  can  provide  90%  savings  for  network  bandwidth  as  well  as  the  disk  space  6...Therefore  a  number  of  solutions 

have been proposed by various researchers in this regard. These solutions have been discussed in detail in this section. 

A.  Encrypting files before uploading 

The attacks described above come into existence because of cross user deduplication, if the sensitive files will be encrypted 

before uploading them to the cloud, this will result in avoiding deduplication and hence none of the attacks will be possible. The 

files can be encrypted by the private key of the user. This key should not be disclosed and should be kept personal by each and 

every  user.  However  this  leads  to  the  problem  of  dictionary  attack.  The  private  key  of  any  user  is  vulnerable  to  offline  

dictionary  attacks.  Also  if  two  users  by  accident  use  same  private  key  then  deduplication  will  still  occur.  Another  problem 

related  with  this  option  is  regarding  the  generation  of  the  personal  key  and  the  bookkeeping  task  for  example  that  if  a  user 

forgets his personal key. The previous research on deduplication proposed a “convergent encryption” this type of encryption is 

capable of generating identical encrypted files from original files even when the users use different personal keys. This method 

keeps the essence of deduplication while providing a good level of security. 3. 

B.  Performing target based deduplication. 

Target  based  deduplication  performs  deduplication  at  the  server  side  rather  than  the  client  side.  This  method  however 

provides the security at the risk of network and bandwidth savings. 

C.  Randomisation 

Randomisation solution was proposed in 1.. This method assigns a number named as, a random threshold to every file. The 

file is not deduplicated until the number of users of the file reach to the threshold. After the number of users of file increases the 

threshold, the deduplication takes place. The biggest loophole of this method is that the threshold is chosen uniformly at random 

thus lacking reliability.   

D.  Proof of ownership 

This  method  uses  block  level  deduplication,  this  process  divides  the  file  into  fixed  or  variable  size  blocks  before 

deduplicating them. In this method, the user needs to provide the proof that he owns the particular file. Suppose user 1 uploads a 

file A. This file will be first divided into number of blocks B, each block will be stored corresponding to a particular index I and 

then stored at the server. Now if user 2 uploads the same file the server will ask the user to prove that he is the real owner of the 

file. For this the server will  ask the user to send a  particular block B(x) corresponding to a specific  index  I(x) where x  is any 

random number corresponding to the number of blocks. If user 2 satisfies the challenge he is added to the access control list of 

the  file  and  in  other  case  the  request  is  not  granted.  However  this  method  reduces  the  chances  of  certain  attacks  like  content 

distribution, it suffers from the problem of probing attack 1... 

E.  Gateway based deduplication 

This method aims to provide transparency to the users and hence the attacker 4.. The gateway acts as a common terminal 

for  all  the  networks  providing  residential  internet  access.  The  abstract  view  of  this  method  is  shown  in  figure  1  4..  All  the 

upload and download requests of users of cloud storage service are handled by the gateway itself. As shown in the figure below 

there  are  five  different  modules  of  the  gateway,  SSP  (storage  service  provider),  gateway  server,  gateway  client,  bandwidth 

manager and the user client. When user client wishes to upload a file from user PC, it sends a request from its home network to 

the gateway server. Since the deduplication does not take place at the client side, the user is now free to proceed with his other 

tasks.  The  gateway  server  handles  the  file  to  the  gateway  client.  The  job  of  gateway  client  is  to  check  with  SSP  weather  the

                                                                                                                                          Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2014  pg. 374-378 
given file is already present on SSP. If the file is already present, SSP server creates a link to the file, however in the other case 

the file is handled to the bandwidth manager which uploads the file to SSP. This method divides the whole setup into two parts 

one of which is easily accessible to the attacker and the other is not, and to provide best security by deduplication attacks, the 

deduplication takes place at the other end. 

Figure 1: Gateway Based Deduplication 4. 

 

This solution is very realistic with minimum vulnerability but the main aim of cloud computing, ubiquitous access is lost. 

IV. FUTURE WORK 

The  solutions  described  above  provide  security  in  different  ways  but  none  of  the  solutions  cover  all  the  vulnerability.  In 

addition to that not even a single method has been proposed which can establish the trust between the user and the cloud service 

provider.  The  client  is  never  assured that  his  files are  known  only  to  him and to  no  one  else  including the SSP. Therefore we 

propose  a  solution  whose  main  aim  is  to  establish  the  trust  between  the  user  and  SSP.  This  method  involves  injecting  an 

application on client side LAN. The abstract view of the setup is shown in figure 1. The various modules and the working of the 

system are described below: 

User is the person who uses the storage service provided. To use the services of SSP the user has to first register himself to 

the  application  the  application  will  generate  a  user  id  corresponding  to  each  user.  M1  is  the  hash  generator  responsible  for 

generating  hash  values  of  a  file  by  certain  algorithm  like  SHA  or  MD5.  When  the  user  uploads  a  file  M1  calculates  its  hash 

value and passes the hash value, user id and username to M2. M2, the second module acts as the database containing hash value 

and user id corresponding to each file. M3 is the database containing the filename corresponding hash value and the user id of 

that file. M4, the Encryption –decryption Module encrypts the file before sending them to the cloud and decrypts the file in the 

reverse case. The cloud is the storage server which contains encrypted file with their respective hash values. When second us er 

will  upload  a  file  already  present  on  the  cloud  its  hash  value  will  be  calculated  and  the  database  M2  will  be  checked  for  the 

presence  of calculated  hash  value.  As the  hash  value  is already  present  in the database, the user will  be attached  to the  list  of 

database having hash value and user id. When this file needs to be retrieved by the user, the database M2 will be checked and 

the file from cloud will be downloaded with reference to the hash value. After this the file will be retrieved from the cloud, it 

will be decrypted and will be provided to the user.

Abstract:  cloud  computing  provides  an  on  demand,  self  service,  rapid,  elastic  and  ubiquitous  access  to  various  computing 

resources. Deduplication is the process of reducing redundancy of data storage services provided by the cloud computing by 

keeping a single copy of any file in spite of ‘n’ number of users of the file. Users are provided with the link to the file and 

only a single copy is stored at the server. 

However, as Deduplication emerges as an answer to the increased demand of storage services in the cloud infrastructures, it 

introduces the vulnerability of side channel attacks due to cross user deduplication. 

This  paper  reviews  and  analyses  various  attacks  related  to  deduplication  and  the  techniques  proposed  to  overcome  those 

attacks. It has been observed that in spite of various solutions provided, deduplication still suffers from the vulnerability of 

one or the other side  channel attack.  Hence  in this paper we propose a solution  which helps to reduce the vulnerability of 

several  side  channel  attacks  while  keeping  the  essence  of  deduplication  alive.  Also  it  helps  to  establish  trust  between  the 

cloud storage provider and user.

capable of generating identical encrypted files from original files even when the users use different personal keys. This method 

keeps the essence of deduplication while providing a good level of security. 3. 

B.  Performing target based deduplication. 

Target  based  deduplication  performs  deduplication  at  the  server  side  rather  than  the  client  side.  This  method  however 

provides the security at the risk of network and bandwidth savings. 

C.  Randomisation 

Randomisation solution was proposed in 1.. This method assigns a number named as, a random threshold to every file. The 

file is not deduplicated until the number of users of the file reach to the threshold. After the number of users of file increases the 

threshold, the deduplication takes place. The biggest loophole of this method is that the threshold is chosen uniformly at random 

thus lacking reliability.   

D.  Proof of ownership 

This  method  uses  block  level  deduplication,  this  process  divides  the  file  into  fixed  or  variable  size  blocks  before 

deduplicating them. In this method, the user needs to provide the proof that he owns the particular file. Suppose user 1 uploads a 

file A. This file will be first divided into number of blocks B, each block will be stored corresponding to a particular index I and 

then stored at the server. Now if user 2 uploads the same file the server will ask the user to prove that he is the real owner of the 

file. For this the server will  ask the user to send a  particular block B(x) corresponding to a specific  index  I(x) where x  is any 

random number corresponding to the number of blocks. If user 2 satisfies the challenge he is added to the access control list of 

the  file  and  in  other  case  the  request  is  not  granted.  However  this  method  reduces  the  chances  of  certain  attacks  like  content 

distribution, it suffers from the problem of probing attack 1... 

E.  Gateway based deduplication 

This method aims to provide transparency to the users and hence the attacker 4.. The gateway acts as a common terminal 

for  all  the  networks  providing  residential  internet  access.  The  abstract  view  of  this  method  is  shown  in  figure  1  4..  All  the 

upload and download requests of users of cloud storage service are handled by the gateway itself. As shown in the figure below 

there  are  five  different  modules  of  the  gateway,  SSP  (storage  service  provider),  gateway  server,  gateway  client,  bandwidth 

manager and the user client. When user client wishes to upload a file from user PC, it sends a request from its home network to 

the gateway server. Since the deduplication does not take place at the client side, the user is now free to proceed with his other 

tasks.  The  gateway  server  handles  the  file  to  the  gateway  client.  The  job  of  gateway  client  is  to  check  with  SSP  weather  the

given file is already present on SSP. If the file is already present, SSP server creates a link to the file, however in the other case 

the file is handled to the bandwidth manager which uploads the file to SSP. This method divides the whole setup into two parts 

one of which is easily accessible to the attacker and the other is not, and to provide best security by deduplication attacks, the 

deduplication takes place at the other end.

This solution is very realistic with minimum vulnerability but the main aim of cloud computing, ubiquitous access is lost. 

IV. FUTURE WORK 

The  solutions  described  above  provide  security  in  different  ways  but  none  of  the  solutions  cover  all  the  vulnerability.  In 

addition to that not even a single method has been proposed which can establish the trust between the user and the cloud service 

provider.  The  client  is  never  assured that  his  files are  known  only  to  him and to  no  one  else  including the SSP. Therefore we 

propose  a  solution  whose  main  aim  is  to  establish  the  trust  between  the  user  and  SSP.  This  method  involves  injecting  an 

application on client side LAN. The abstract view of the setup is shown in figure 1. The various modules and the working of the 

system are described below: 

User is the person who uses the storage service provided. To use the services of SSP the user has to first register himself to 

the  application  the  application  will  generate  a  user  id  corresponding  to  each  user.  M1  is  the  hash  generator  responsible  for 

generating  hash  values  of  a  file  by  certain  algorithm  like  SHA  or  MD5.  When  the  user  uploads  a  file  M1  calculates  its  hash 

value and passes the hash value, user id and username to M2. M2, the second module acts as the database containing hash value 

and user id corresponding to each file. M3 is the database containing the filename corresponding hash value and the user id of 

that file. M4, the Encryption –decryption Module encrypts the file before sending them to the cloud and decrypts the file in the 

reverse case. The cloud is the storage server which contains encrypted file with their respective hash values. When second us er 

will  upload  a  file  already  present  on  the  cloud  its  hash  value  will  be  calculated  and  the  database  M2  will  be  checked  for  the 

presence  of calculated  hash  value.  As the  hash  value  is already  present  in the database, the user will  be attached  to the  list  of 

database having hash value and user id. When this file needs to be retrieved by the user, the database M2 will be checked and 

the file from cloud will be downloaded with reference to the hash value. After this the file will be retrieved from the cloud, it 

will be decrypted and will be provided to the user.

V. CONCLUSION 

This  paper  aims  to  present  various  risks  induced  in  cloud  storage  services  due  to  the  use  of  deduplication.  Taking  into 

consideration  the  amount  of  network  bandwidth  and  disk  space  saved  by  deduplication,  various  methods  have  been  proposed 

against  these  risks.  These  methods  with  their  pros  and  cons  have  also  been  presented  in  the  paper.  These  solutions  however 

suffer from one or the other loophole. In our work we propose a solution that not only removes the risk of all the three attacks 

described but also it helps to establish a trust between the cloud service provider and the user.
