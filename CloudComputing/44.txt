INTRODUCTION 

Today  cloud  has  made  it  possible  to  access  our  data  from  anywhere,  anytime.  When  compared  to  a  traditional  IT  setup  which 
requires same location for user and data storage device, in cloud we do not have such limitations. Cloud is very helpful for small & 
medium businesses which cannot afford bigger hardware and storage space. They can store their information in the cloud, reducing 
the cost of buying and storing memory devices. Additionally, we only need to buy or pay for only the amount of storage space used; 
we can increase and decrease the subscription as per the need of business. 
 
To  run  a  cloud  computing  setup  we  need  to  have  an  internet  connection.  The  benefit  of  this  is  that  we  can  access  that  same 
document  from  wherever  we  are  with  any  device  that  can  access  the  internet.  These  electronic  devices  could  be  desktop,  laptop, 
tablet,  or  phone. This  can  also  help  our  business  to  function  more  smoothly  because  anyone  who  can  connect  to  the  internet  and 
your cloud can work on documents, access software, and store data. Imagine picking up your smartphone and downloading a .pdf 
document to review  instead of  stopping by  the office  for print or  upload it to  your laptop. This is  the freedom that the cloud can 
provide for you or your organization [1].

CLOUD COMPUTING 

In  Cloud  Computing  we  use  improved  capabilities  of  many  previous  technologies  as  a  system;  the  idea  behind  this  is  to  provide 
unlimited resources virtually to any demanding organization. In cloud computing, users only pay for resources that they use [2]. We 
access the cloud services through internet connection and organizations can use computing resources as and when they need it. [3]. 
This system also improves the business continuity and reduces IT infrastructure cost.  
 
 

III. 

CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS 

 

 

There are four deployment models of cloud. 
 

 

1.  Public Cloud:-Any subscriber can access in pubic cloud. 
2.  Private Cloud:-The specific organization can access in private cloud. 
3.  Community Cloud:-Two or more organization share the data to make a community and access the community cloud . 
4.  Hybrid Cloud:-Hybrid cloud is integrated model and it is the combination of public and private cloud [4].

CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES 

The cloud computing services are:- 
 
Software as a Service:-In software as a service, an application provide on customer’s side. There is no need to software licenses 
because this application is not installed on physical computer.     
Platform as a Service:- In platform as a service , a platform to run the services and utilize the resources of cloud is provided.  
Infrastructure  as  a  Service:-Infrastructure  as  a  Service  is  a  service    provide  the  computing  capabilities  and  storage,  networking 
equipment over the network and it is responsible for its maintenance. customer access this service on-demand.

VIRTUALIZATION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
Virtualization means something such as hardware, computer network and storage available virtually rather than actual[7]. 
 
Types of Virtualization 
 
1) 
2) 

Full Virtualization:-In full virtualization a complete services of one machine simulated on another machine. 
Para Virtualization:-In para virtualization only software environment simulated and a hardware interface is not present in 
virtual machine. 

 

 
A Data Centre is a centralized repository or a housing of computer systems[8]. Data centre stored the large information about the 
organization and also manage it. Private data centre is just like aserver within the organization. The National Climatic Data Center 
(NCDC) is the example of data centre. Security issues is also associated with data for cloud[9].

SCHEDULING 

 
 A schedule by which tasks are executed in particular time period is called scheduling. There are some situations where we need the

VIRTUALIZATION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
Virtualization means something such as hardware, computer network and storage available virtually rather than actual[7]. 
 
Types of Virtualization 
 
1) 
2) 

Full Virtualization:-In full virtualization a complete services of one machine simulated on another machine. 
Para Virtualization:-In para virtualization only software environment simulated and a hardware interface is not present in 
virtual machine. 

 

 
A Data Centre is a centralized repository or a housing of computer systems[8]. Data centre stored the large information about the 
organization and also manage it. Private data centre is just like aserver within the organization. The National Climatic Data Center 
(NCDC) is the example of data centre. Security issues is also associated with data for cloud[9].

Abstract-- Cloud computing is a new concept and it is based on fact that reuses the resources of IT and capabilities. 
This paper gives a brief introduction of cloud computing and also discuss about the challenging issue scheduling in 
cloud computing and proposed an optimal scheduling algorithm that minimize the cost and completion time of task. 
Cloud computing is a technology in which user only pay for needed resources. Cloud computing attract many users 
because they can access computing resources any time anywhere

INTRODUCTION 

Today  cloud  has  made  it  possible  to  access  our  data  from  anywhere,  anytime.  When  compared  to  a  traditional  IT  setup  which 
requires same location for user and data storage device, in cloud we do not have such limitations. Cloud is very helpful for small & 
medium businesses which cannot afford bigger hardware and storage space. They can store their information in the cloud, reducing 
the cost of buying and storing memory devices. Additionally, we only need to buy or pay for only the amount of storage space used; 
we can increase and decrease the subscription as per the need of business. 
 
To  run  a  cloud  computing  setup  we  need  to  have  an  internet  connection.  The  benefit  of  this  is  that  we  can  access  that  same 
document  from  wherever  we  are  with  any  device  that  can  access  the  internet.  These  electronic  devices  could  be  desktop,  laptop, 
tablet,  or  phone. This  can  also  help  our  business  to  function  more  smoothly  because  anyone  who  can  connect  to  the  internet  and 
your cloud can work on documents, access software, and store data. Imagine picking up your smartphone and downloading a .pdf 
document to review  instead of  stopping by  the office  for print or  upload it to  your laptop. This is  the freedom that the cloud can 
provide for you or your organization [1]. 
 

 

II. 

CLOUD COMPUTING 

In  Cloud  Computing  we  use  improved  capabilities  of  many  previous  technologies  as  a  system;  the  idea  behind  this  is  to  provide 
unlimited resources virtually to any demanding organization. In cloud computing, users only pay for resources that they use [2]. We 
access the cloud services through internet connection and organizations can use computing resources as and when they need it. [3]. 
This system also improves the business continuity and reduces IT infrastructure cost.  
 
 

III. 

CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS 

 

 

There are four deployment models of cloud. 
 

 

1.  Public Cloud:-Any subscriber can access in pubic cloud. 
2.  Private Cloud:-The specific organization can access in private cloud. 
3.  Community Cloud:-Two or more organization share the data to make a community and access the community cloud . 
4.  Hybrid Cloud:-Hybrid cloud is integrated model and it is the combination of public and private cloud [4]. 

 
 
 

 

IV. 

CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES 

The cloud computing services are:- 
 
Software as a Service:-In software as a service, an application provide on customer’s side. There is no need to software licenses 
because this application is not installed on physical computer.     
Platform as a Service:- In platform as a service , a platform to run the services and utilize the resources of cloud is provided.  
Infrastructure  as  a  Service:-Infrastructure  as  a  Service  is  a  service    provide  the  computing  capabilities  and  storage,  networking 
equipment over the network and it is responsible for its maintenance. customer access this service on-demand.
