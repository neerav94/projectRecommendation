ABSTRACT 

Cloud computing is emerging fastly and no doubt it is the next generation technology where humans will be using anywhere and 
anytime.  In  this  internet  world  cloud  computing  is  raising  high  by  providing  everything  incense  the  required  resources, 
applications, software, hardware, computing power to computing infrastructure, business process to control collaboration. Today 
clouds with virtualization are transforming IT. Apart of its popularity it  has  some concerns  which are becoming huddles for its 
wider adoption. In this paper a study has been made on virtualization concerns.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is becoming popular as virtualization power, distributed computing with server cluster 

and increase in the availability of broadband internet assessing is increasing. 

 

 
The  IT  world  is  looking  forward  for  the  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  thus  boosting  up  the 

development of cloud computing.  

 

NIST  [1]  has  defined  cloud  as  “Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  convenient,  on-
demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal  management  effort  or 
service provider interaction”.    

 
 

According to  2013 future of cloud  computing survey  reveals  that cloud  adoption continued to  raise in

II.  DEFINETION OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

 

Cloud      computing  is  the  outcome  of        grid  computing,  utility  computing  and  automatic  computing. 
Cloud  is  a  parallel  and  distributed  computing  system  which  consists  a  set  of  inter  connected  and  virtualized 
computers  which  gives  one  or  more  unified  computing  resources  based  on  the  requirements  between  service 
providers and service consumers[4].   

 
Cloud computing is on demand pay-as-use  i.e billing is done based on the usage of the customer which 
downs the operational and capital cost. Users can access applications which are present outside the working site 
which can access remote applications through internet connection devices. By this, computer resources can be 
efficiently used and consume less computing power and resources are shared cooperatively. 

Fig1:Architecture of cloud 

 

 
Cloud computing services are first offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and now many are existing. 
These services are used by software industries, government sectors, and health care sectors and in many more 
fields. 
 
 
 
The main power of cloud computing lies in the way data is stored, how it is transmitted and accessed. A 
virtualized  platform  with  management  capabilities  like  availability,  automated  load  balancing  and  fault 
tolerance reduces infrastructure cost and maintenance cost. 
 

III. COMPONENTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing has clients, data centers, distributed servers as the components. 

 
 
 
Clients: Users like computers, laptops, tablets computers mobile phones or PDA’s. 
 
Data  Centers:  These  are  a  collection  of  servers  where  the  application  is  hosted.  Virtualization  is  done  where 
multiple instances of virtual servers are created. 
 
Distributed Server:  Servers which reside non locally which are geographically far. 
 
 
 
The  main  objective  of  cloud  computing  is  to  offer  computing  power,  storage  and  software  “as  a 
service”. By the help of services in cloud computing offers usability, fine grained components. Services offer 
scalability, multi tenancy and device independence. There are three typed of cloud services. 
 
Saas: Software as a Service is the model in which an application is hosted as a service to customers who access 
through internet. Users can access their application anywhere if they are connected to internet.

where any time through internet. Example of a public cloud is Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) 
Amazon EC2 provides the following features[11]: 

  Virtual computing environments, called as instances 
  Pre-configured templates for  instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the 

bits need for clients server (including the operating system and additional software) 

  Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for known as instance types 
  Secure login information for  instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and clients store the 

private key in a secure place) 

  Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when client stops or terminates instance, known as 

instance store volumes 

  Persistent storage volumes for users data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as 

Amazon EBS volumes 

  Multiple physical locations for users resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as 

regions and Availability Zones 

  A firewall that enables users to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach user 

instances using security groups 

  Static IP addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses 
  Metadata, known as tags, that user can create and assign to  Amazon EC2 resources 
  Virtual networks user can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that can 

optionally connect to users network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)

and  manage  by  the  organization.  In  private  hardware  and  software  sharing  is  limited  and  security  is 
provided by encryption. It is setup with organization’s internal enterprise datacenter.

various functions within the same organization. Public cloud services are more cost effective and scalable than 
private  clouds[8].  Therefore,  an  organization  can  maximize  their  efficiencies  by  employing  public  cloud 
services for all non-sensitive operations, only relying on a private cloud where they require it and ensuring that 
all of their platforms are seamlessly integrated. 

Hybrid cloud models can be implemented in a number of ways: 

  Separate cloud providers team up to provide both private and public services as an integrated service 
 

Individual cloud providers offer a complete hybrid package

ABSTRACT 

Cloud computing is emerging fastly and no doubt it is the next generation technology where humans will be using anywhere and 
anytime.  In  this  internet  world  cloud  computing  is  raising  high  by  providing  everything  incense  the  required  resources, 
applications, software, hardware, computing power to computing infrastructure, business process to control collaboration. Today 
clouds with virtualization are transforming IT. Apart of its popularity it  has  some concerns  which are becoming huddles for its 
wider adoption. In this paper a study has been made on virtualization concerns. 

Keywords: cloud computing, security in clouds, network security, Virtualization, Effects of virtualization  

 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is becoming popular as virtualization power, distributed computing with server cluster 

and increase in the availability of broadband internet assessing is increasing. 

 

 
The  IT  world  is  looking  forward  for  the  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  thus  boosting  up  the 

development of cloud computing.  

 

NIST  [1]  has  defined  cloud  as  “Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  convenient,  on-
demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal  management  effort  or 
service provider interaction”.    

 
 

According to  2013 future of cloud  computing survey  reveals  that cloud  adoption continued to  raise in 
2013, with 75 percent of those surveyed reporting the use of some sort of cloud platform up from 67 percent 
last year. That growth is consistent with forecasts from GigaOM Research, which expects the total worldwide 
addressable market for cloud computing to reach $158.8B by 2014, an increase of 126.5 percent from 2011. 

  

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows  Section-II  defines  cloud  computing,  Section-III  describes  the 
components  and  services  of  cloud  computing,  Section-IV  gives  the  deployment  models  of  clouds,  Section-V 
gives the Virtualization issues in clouds and finally section-VI provides Conclusions.

II.  DEFINETION OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

 

Cloud      computing  is  the  outcome  of        grid  computing,  utility  computing  and  automatic  computing. 
Cloud  is  a  parallel  and  distributed  computing  system  which  consists  a  set  of  inter  connected  and  virtualized 
computers  which  gives  one  or  more  unified  computing  resources  based  on  the  requirements  between  service 
providers and service consumers[4].   

 
Cloud computing is on demand pay-as-use  i.e billing is done based on the usage of the customer which 
downs the operational and capital cost. Users can access applications which are present outside the working site 
which can access remote applications through internet connection devices. By this, computer resources can be 
efficiently used and consume less computing power and resources are shared cooperatively. 

Fig1:Architecture of cloud 

 

 
Cloud computing services are first offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and now many are existing. 
These services are used by software industries, government sectors, and health care sectors and in many more 
fields. 
 
 
 
The main power of cloud computing lies in the way data is stored, how it is transmitted and accessed. A 
virtualized  platform  with  management  capabilities  like  availability,  automated  load  balancing  and  fault 
tolerance reduces infrastructure cost and maintenance cost. 
 

III. COMPONENTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing has clients, data centers, distributed servers as the components. 

 
 
 
Clients: Users like computers, laptops, tablets computers mobile phones or PDA’s. 
 
Data  Centers:  These  are  a  collection  of  servers  where  the  application  is  hosted.  Virtualization  is  done  where 
multiple instances of virtual servers are created. 
 
Distributed Server:  Servers which reside non locally which are geographically far. 
 
 
 
The  main  objective  of  cloud  computing  is  to  offer  computing  power,  storage  and  software  “as  a 
service”. By the help of services in cloud computing offers usability, fine grained components. Services offer 
scalability, multi tenancy and device independence. There are three typed of cloud services. 
 
Saas: Software as a Service is the model in which an application is hosted as a service to customers who access 
through internet. Users can access their application anywhere if they are connected to internet.

Some of the applications are CRM (customer Resource Managing), accounting, web content managing. 

 
 
The main advantage of SaaS is that  

  Users can get software with less money than buying and installing it. 
 
  Security is ensured as it uses SSL (secure socket layer). 

It offers web reliability, as the web is reliable the applications that are running are more reliable.  

 

Developers  can  design,  develop,  test  and  deploy  and  host  applications.  More  services  are  like  team

build application and services completely from internet without purchasing. 
 
collaboration, web service integration, DB integration. 
 
The main advantage of Paas is that 

  Paas provides greater flexibility, speed and agility to the development process. 
 
 

It provides a predictable, heterogeneous application infrastructure. 
It reduces server storage overhead. 
 

IaaS:  Infrastructure  as  a  service.  This  provides  the  required  hardware  so  that  users  can  put  anything  they 
required.  Iaas  allows  renting  of  resources  like  server  space,  cpu  cycles,  network  equipments,  memory  and 
storage space. 
 
The main advantages of Iaas are 

Infrastructure can be dynamically scaled up or down based on the requirement. 

 
  Virtualization as service which allows clients to run the virtual machines. 
  Network as a service which includes hardware for firewalls, routers and load balancing. 

 
Through these services cloud computing get’s the application a way of viewing, manipulating and sharing data. 
 
Cloud  computing  has  many  benefits  like  scalability,  storage,  simplicity,  knowledgeable  vendors  and 
many  resource  providers.  Apart  of  these  clouds  have  its  limitations  like  security  of  sensitive  data  storage, 
security in transferring data, privacy issues with the third party. 
 

 
 
networking, storage are provided to the clients. Cloud has three working models 

In  the  cloud  computing  deployment  model  services  like  software  and  hardware  infrastructure,

  Organizations who manage their private clouds themselves sign up to a public cloud service which they 

then integrate into their infrastructure. 

In practice, an enterprise could implement hybrid cloud hosting to host their e-commerce website within a 
private  cloud,  where  it  is  secure  and  scalable,  but  their  brochure  site  in  a  public  cloud,  where  it  is  more  cost 
effective  (and  security  is  less  of  a  concern).  Alternatively,  an  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  offering,  for 
example,  could  follow  the  hybrid  cloud  model  and  provide  a  financial  business  with  storage  for  client  data 
within a private cloud, but then allow collaboration on project planning documents in the public cloud - where 
they can be accessed by multiple users from any convenient location. 
  
A hybrid cloud configuration, such as hybrid hosting, can offer its users the following features: 

  Scalability: Public and private cloud services offers scalability but with boundaries because resource is 

pulled from the larger cloud infrastructure.   

  Security:  The  private  cloud  component  not  only  provides  needed  security  for  sensitive  operations  but 

also satisfy regulatory requirements for data handling and storage. 

  Flexibility:  The  hybrid  cloud  provides  flexibility  of  both  secure  and  scalable  cost  effective  public 

resource. 

  Cover Legacy Gaps: hybrid model fills the gap between old and new systems. 
  Cut Energy Costs: Data and technology standards can be maintained at lower cost. 

 

V.  VIRTUALIZATION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
virtualization  in  computing  is  creation  of  virtual  (not  real)  of  virtual  something  such  as  hardware, 
software, platform or a operating system or a storage or a network device[8]. In a virtualized environment  IT 
enterprise  has  to  manage  many  changes  as  the  changes  occur  more  quickly  in  virtual  environment  than  in  a 
physical environment. Because of virtualization clouds are scalable and agile.  

Even  though  cloud  computing  can  exists  without  virtualization  it  may  be  inefficient  and  difficult.  As 

 
cloud computing tags with "pay-as-use" and "infinite" availability these are mainly virtualization theme. 

fig3: Virtualization mechanism 

 

Advantages of virtualization in cloud computing 

Virtualization technology makes cloud computing environment easily to manage the resources. It abstracts and 
isolates the underlying hardware, and networking resources in a single hosting environment.

the application equally. The main feature of public cloud is multi tenancy more than one user can access any 
where any time through internet. Example of a public cloud is Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) 
Amazon EC2 provides the following features[11]: 

  Virtual computing environments, called as instances 
  Pre-configured templates for  instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the 

bits need for clients server (including the operating system and additional software) 

  Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for known as instance types 
  Secure login information for  instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and clients store the 

private key in a secure place) 

  Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when client stops or terminates instance, known as 

instance store volumes 

  Persistent storage volumes for users data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as 

Amazon EBS volumes 

  Multiple physical locations for users resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as 

regions and Availability Zones 

  A firewall that enables users to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach user 

instances using security groups 

  Static IP addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses 
  Metadata, known as tags, that user can create and assign to  Amazon EC2 resources 
  Virtual networks user can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that can 

optionally connect to users network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs) 

 
Private  cloud:  The  services  and  infrastructure  made  available  to  a  specific  customer,  which  is  owned 
and  manage  by  the  organization.  In  private  hardware  and  software  sharing  is  limited  and  security  is 
provided by encryption. It is setup with organization’s internal enterprise datacenter.                                    

One of the examples of private cloud is introduction of cloud educational projects in Northern Ireland. 
Where  billing  of  resources  is  done  smoothly  through  cloud.  That’s  the  approach  being  adopted  by  C2k,  the 
organization  established  to  help  schools  in  Northern  Ireland  get  the  best  for  teaching  and  learning  from 
education technology. 

One of the largest and most comprehensive educational ICT initiatives in the UK, C2k provides schools 
in  Northern  Ireland  with  a  comprehensive  managed  ICT  service.  The  service  includes  a  LAN  in  each  school 
with  access  to  a  Northern  Ireland  WAN,  administration  and  management  systems  for  schools,  access  to  the 
Learning  NI  managed  learning  environment  (including  filtered  access  to  the  internet  and  e-mail),  the  Virtual 
Classroom secure videoconferencing system and full service support. 

 The  private  cloud  model  is  closer  to  the  more  traditional  model  of  individual  local  access  networks 

(LANs) used in the past by enterprise but with the added advantages of virtualization. 

Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud is an integrated cloud service utilizing both private and public clouds to perform 
various functions within the same organization. Public cloud services are more cost effective and scalable than 
private  clouds[8].  Therefore,  an  organization  can  maximize  their  efficiencies  by  employing  public  cloud 
services for all non-sensitive operations, only relying on a private cloud where they require it and ensuring that 
all of their platforms are seamlessly integrated. 

Hybrid cloud models can be implemented in a number of ways: 

  Separate cloud providers team up to provide both private and public services as an integrated service 
 

Individual cloud providers offer a complete hybrid package

  Organizations who manage their private clouds themselves sign up to a public cloud service which they 

then integrate into their infrastructure. 

In practice, an enterprise could implement hybrid cloud hosting to host their e-commerce website within a 
private  cloud,  where  it  is  secure  and  scalable,  but  their  brochure  site  in  a  public  cloud,  where  it  is  more  cost 
effective  (and  security  is  less  of  a  concern).  Alternatively,  an  Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  offering,  for 
example,  could  follow  the  hybrid  cloud  model  and  provide  a  financial  business  with  storage  for  client  data 
within a private cloud, but then allow collaboration on project planning documents in the public cloud - where 
they can be accessed by multiple users from any convenient location. 
  
A hybrid cloud configuration, such as hybrid hosting, can offer its users the following features: 

  Scalability: Public and private cloud services offers scalability but with boundaries because resource is 

pulled from the larger cloud infrastructure.   

  Security:  The  private  cloud  component  not  only  provides  needed  security  for  sensitive  operations  but 

also satisfy regulatory requirements for data handling and storage. 

  Flexibility:  The  hybrid  cloud  provides  flexibility  of  both  secure  and  scalable  cost  effective  public 

resource. 

  Cover Legacy Gaps: hybrid model fills the gap between old and new systems. 
  Cut Energy Costs: Data and technology standards can be maintained at lower cost. 

 

V.  VIRTUALIZATION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
virtualization  in  computing  is  creation  of  virtual  (not  real)  of  virtual  something  such  as  hardware, 
software, platform or a operating system or a storage or a network device[8]. In a virtualized environment  IT 
enterprise  has  to  manage  many  changes  as  the  changes  occur  more  quickly  in  virtual  environment  than  in  a 
physical environment. Because of virtualization clouds are scalable and agile.  

Even  though  cloud  computing  can  exists  without  virtualization  it  may  be  inefficient  and  difficult.  As 

 
cloud computing tags with "pay-as-use" and "infinite" availability these are mainly virtualization theme.

Advantages of virtualization in cloud computing 

Virtualization technology makes cloud computing environment easily to manage the resources. It abstracts and 
isolates the underlying hardware, and networking resources in a single hosting environment.

It  increases  the  security  of  cloud  computing  by      protecting  both  the  integrity  on  guest  virtual  machine  and 
cloud  components  virtualized  machines  can  be  scaled  up  or  down  on  demand  and  can  provide  reliability.  It 
provides resource sharing, high utilization of pooled resources, rapid provisioning, workload isolation. 

The recent trends in virtualization are consolidation of data centers thus reducing the managing cost. 

Apart of its benefits it has some drawbacks like managing virtual resources is critical and migrating services of 
these resources are difficult in achieving high availability.  

If  one  server  fail  VM  will  be  restarted  on  the  other  virtualized  server  in  resource  pool  restoring  the  required 
services with minimum service interruption. 

Virtual resources are critical for managing and data monitoring. Running applications with high utilization and 
availability is a challenging issue.  

Hypervisor:  A  hypervisor  is  a  software,  hardware  or  a  firmware  that  provides  virtual  partitioning  capabilities 
which runs directly on hardware. It is defined as the virtual machine manager which allows multiple operating 
systems to run on a system at a time providing resources to each OS without any interaction. 

Hypervisor  controls  all  the  guest  systems.  As  the  operating  system  number  increases  managing  is 
 
difficult  these  leads  to  security  issues.  If  a  hacker  gets  control  over  the  hypervisor  he  can  control  the  guest 
systems  by  knowing  the  behavior  of  the  system  which  causes  data  processing  damage.  Advanced  protection 
system is to be developed to monitor the activities of the guest Virtual machine[9]. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

To have physical and virtual controls in the cloud environment one must protect data by implementing strong 
encrypting techniques using secure connections and applying data loss prevention policies[12]. 

Access control policies are to be established and client identities are to be checked. 

Datacenter platforms, infrastructure and client devices are to be secured by trusted computer policies.   

Enable secure migration from private cloud environment to public cloud providers.

ABSTRACT 

Cloud computing is emerging fastly and no doubt it is the next generation technology where humans will be using anywhere and 
anytime.  In  this  internet  world  cloud  computing  is  raising  high  by  providing  everything  incense  the  required  resources, 
applications, software, hardware, computing power to computing infrastructure, business process to control collaboration. Today 
clouds with virtualization are transforming IT. Apart of its popularity it  has  some concerns  which are becoming huddles for its 
wider adoption. In this paper a study has been made on virtualization concerns. 

Keywords: cloud computing, security in clouds, network security, Virtualization, Effects of virtualization  

 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is becoming popular as virtualization power, distributed computing with server cluster 

and increase in the availability of broadband internet assessing is increasing. 

 

 
The  IT  world  is  looking  forward  for  the  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  thus  boosting  up  the 

development of cloud computing.  

 

NIST  [1]  has  defined  cloud  as  “Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  convenient,  on-
demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal  management  effort  or 
service provider interaction”.    

 
 

According to  2013 future of cloud  computing survey  reveals  that cloud  adoption continued to  raise in 
2013, with 75 percent of those surveyed reporting the use of some sort of cloud platform up from 67 percent 
last year. That growth is consistent with forecasts from GigaOM Research, which expects the total worldwide 
addressable market for cloud computing to reach $158.8B by 2014, an increase of 126.5 percent from 2011. 

  

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows  Section-II  defines  cloud  computing,  Section-III  describes  the 
components  and  services  of  cloud  computing,  Section-IV  gives  the  deployment  models  of  clouds,  Section-V 
gives the Virtualization issues in clouds and finally section-VI provides Conclusions.

II.  DEFINETION OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

 

Cloud      computing  is  the  outcome  of        grid  computing,  utility  computing  and  automatic  computing. 
Cloud  is  a  parallel  and  distributed  computing  system  which  consists  a  set  of  inter  connected  and  virtualized 
computers  which  gives  one  or  more  unified  computing  resources  based  on  the  requirements  between  service 
providers and service consumers[4].   

 
Cloud computing is on demand pay-as-use  i.e billing is done based on the usage of the customer which 
downs the operational and capital cost. Users can access applications which are present outside the working site 
which can access remote applications through internet connection devices. By this, computer resources can be 
efficiently used and consume less computing power and resources are shared cooperatively. 

Fig1:Architecture of cloud 

 

 
Cloud computing services are first offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and now many are existing. 
These services are used by software industries, government sectors, and health care sectors and in many more 
fields. 
 
 
 
The main power of cloud computing lies in the way data is stored, how it is transmitted and accessed. A 
virtualized  platform  with  management  capabilities  like  availability,  automated  load  balancing  and  fault 
tolerance reduces infrastructure cost and maintenance cost. 
 

III. COMPONENTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing has clients, data centers, distributed servers as the components. 

 
 
 
Clients: Users like computers, laptops, tablets computers mobile phones or PDA’s. 
 
Data  Centers:  These  are  a  collection  of  servers  where  the  application  is  hosted.  Virtualization  is  done  where 
multiple instances of virtual servers are created. 
 
Distributed Server:  Servers which reside non locally which are geographically far. 
 
 
 
The  main  objective  of  cloud  computing  is  to  offer  computing  power,  storage  and  software  “as  a 
service”. By the help of services in cloud computing offers usability, fine grained components. Services offer 
scalability, multi tenancy and device independence. There are three typed of cloud services. 
 
Saas: Software as a Service is the model in which an application is hosted as a service to customers who access 
through internet. Users can access their application anywhere if they are connected to internet.

Some of the applications are CRM (customer Resource Managing), accounting, web content managing. 

 
 
The main advantage of SaaS is that  

  Users can get software with less money than buying and installing it. 
 
  Security is ensured as it uses SSL (secure socket layer). 

It offers web reliability, as the web is reliable the applications that are running are more reliable.  

 

Developers  can  design,  develop,  test  and  deploy  and  host  applications.  More  services  are  like  team 

PaaS:  Platform  as a Service. This  is  another  application delivery model  which provides  resources required to 
build application and services completely from internet without purchasing. 
 
collaboration, web service integration, DB integration. 
 
The main advantage of Paas is that 

  Paas provides greater flexibility, speed and agility to the development process. 
 
 

It provides a predictable, heterogeneous application infrastructure. 
It reduces server storage overhead. 
 

IaaS:  Infrastructure  as  a  service.  This  provides  the  required  hardware  so  that  users  can  put  anything  they 
required.  Iaas  allows  renting  of  resources  like  server  space,  cpu  cycles,  network  equipments,  memory  and 
storage space. 
 
The main advantages of Iaas are 

Infrastructure can be dynamically scaled up or down based on the requirement. 

 
  Virtualization as service which allows clients to run the virtual machines. 
  Network as a service which includes hardware for firewalls, routers and load balancing. 

 
Through these services cloud computing get’s the application a way of viewing, manipulating and sharing data. 
 
Cloud  computing  has  many  benefits  like  scalability,  storage,  simplicity,  knowledgeable  vendors  and 
many  resource  providers.  Apart  of  these  clouds  have  its  limitations  like  security  of  sensitive  data  storage, 
security in transferring data, privacy issues with the third party. 
 

 
 
networking, storage are provided to the clients. Cloud has three working models 

In  the  cloud  computing  deployment  model  services  like  software  and  hardware  infrastructure,

If  one  server  fail  VM  will  be  restarted  on  the  other  virtualized  server  in  resource  pool  restoring  the  required 
services with minimum service interruption. 

Virtual resources are critical for managing and data monitoring. Running applications with high utilization and 
availability is a challenging issue.  

Hypervisor:  A  hypervisor  is  a  software,  hardware  or  a  firmware  that  provides  virtual  partitioning  capabilities 
which runs directly on hardware. It is defined as the virtual machine manager which allows multiple operating 
systems to run on a system at a time providing resources to each OS without any interaction. 

Hypervisor  controls  all  the  guest  systems.  As  the  operating  system  number  increases  managing  is 
 
difficult  these  leads  to  security  issues.  If  a  hacker  gets  control  over  the  hypervisor  he  can  control  the  guest 
systems  by  knowing  the  behavior  of  the  system  which  causes  data  processing  damage.  Advanced  protection 
system is to be developed to monitor the activities of the guest Virtual machine[9]. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

To have physical and virtual controls in the cloud environment one must protect data by implementing strong 
encrypting techniques using secure connections and applying data loss prevention policies[12]. 

Access control policies are to be established and client identities are to be checked. 

Datacenter platforms, infrastructure and client devices are to be secured by trusted computer policies.   

Enable secure migration from private cloud environment to public cloud providers.
