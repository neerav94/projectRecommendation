Abstract: 
Cloud computing refers to a computing hardware machine or group of computing hardware machines commonly referred as 
a server or  servers  connected  through  a communication  network such  as  the  Internet,  an intranet,  a local  area  network 
(LAN) or wide  area  network  (WAN).  Any  individual  user  who  has  permission  to  access  the  server  can  use  the  server's 
processing  power  to  run  an  application,  store  data,  or  perform  any  other  computing  task.  Therefore,  instead  of  using  a 
personal computer every-time to run the application, the individual can now run the application from anywhere in the world, 
as  the  server  provides  the  processing  power  to  the  application  and  the  server  is  also  connected  to  a  network  via  Internet  or 
other  connection  platforms  to  be  accessed  from  anywhere.  While  searching  the  data  in  the  cloud  the  attackers  prefer  the 
keyword  which  is  not  secured  properly.  The  existing  technique  resolves  the  optimization  complexities  in  ranked  keyword 
search and its effective utilization of remotely stored encrypted cloud data. But it limits the further optimizations of the search 
results by preventing cloud server to interact with cloud users to maintain the integrity of actual owner’s keyword and the data 
associated with it. The aim is to define a framework which enhances  the accuracy of the ranked keyword search  by secured 
machine learning, which does not affect the data integrity

pool  of  resources,  including  data  storage  space,  networks,  computer  processing  power,  and  specialized  corporate  and  user 
applications. 
Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing 
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal 
management  effort  or  service  provider  interaction.  This  cloud  model  promotes  availability  and  is  composed  of  five  essential 
characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. 
 
2. Characteristics:- 
The characteristics of cloud computing include on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity 
and  measured  service.  On-demand  self  service  means  that  customers  (usually  organizations)  can  request  and  manage  their  own 
computing resources. Broad network access allows services to be offered over the Internet or private networks. Pooled resources 
means that customers draw  from a pool of computing resources, usually in remote data  centre. Services can be scaled larger or 
smaller; and use of a service is measured and customers are billed accordingly.

•  Deployment Models 

–  Private cloud 
–  Community cloud 
–  Public cloud

1. 

 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) also referred to as Resource Clouds, provide resources as services to the user – in other 
words, they basically provide enhanced virtualization capabilities. 

              Examples: Amazon S3, SQL Azure. 

2.  Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide computational resources via a platform upon which applications and services can 
be developed and hosted. PaaS typically makes use of dedicated APIs to control the behavior of a server hosting engine 
which executes and replicates the execution according to user requests (e.g. access rate). 

              Examples: Force.com, Google App Engine. 

3.  Software as a Service (SaaS), also sometimes referred to as Service or Application Clouds are offering implementations 

of specific business functions and business processes that are provided with specific cloud capabilities. 

              Examples: Google Docs, SAP Business by Design. 
 
Public  clouds  are  offered  over  the  Internet  and  are  owned  and  operated  by  a  cloud  provider.  Some  examples  include  services 
aimed at the general public, such as online photo storage services, e-mail services, or social networking sites. 
In a private cloud, the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a specific organization, and is managed by the organization or a 
third party. 
In a community cloud, the service is shared by several organizations and made available only to those groups. The infrastructure 
may be owned and operated by the organizations or by a cloud service provider. 
A hybrid cloud is a combination of different methods of resource pooling (for example, combining public and community clouds. 
 
4. Problem Statement:- 
Cloud  is  one  of  the  major  part  of  Web  architecture.  The  cloud  architecture  is  widely  spread  in  the  form  of  public  cloud  and 
available to all the users. There are number of cloud service providers. When a user pass a query for a specific cloud service with 
well specified requirements then a search engine based work is suggested in this research  proposal. In this work at first the user 
query will be analyzed respective to user requirement specification. Now a parametric match will be performed according to the 
user  interest  and  other  parameters.  On  the  basis  of  this  parametric  match  the  ranking  will  be  assigned  to  all  the  eligible  cloud 
services. In this presented work, the ranking criteria are specified on the basis of implicit and explicit properties such as content 
relevancy, user interest and response time etc.

Input: User 

Query 

 
5. DEVELOPMENT SCHEME FOR RANKING:- 
The proposed work is about to optimize the topic based Cloud Service crawling process with the concept of exclusion of duplicate 
pages. For this a new architecture is proposed, this architecture will use the rank based service selection approach. In this work the 
ranking is performed respective main criteria’s called User Interest Analysis. 
The user will interact to the Cloud Service with his topic based query to retrieve the Cloud Service pages. As the page is query 
performed  it  will  perform  request  to  the  Cloud  Service  and  generate  the  basic  URL  list.  Now  it  will  retrieve  the  data  from  the 
Cloud Service. For the URL collection it will use some concepts like indexing and the ranking. The indexing will provide a fast 
access to the Cloud Service page where as ranking will arrange the list according to the priority. 
Now as a Cloud Service page is fetched, the proposed approach  will retrieve the keywords form the document and perform the 
relevancy match by performing the match of service keywords with user  query.  Now as a new page is retrieved it will generate 
the suffix tree and perform a suffix tree based comparison to analyze the relevancy ratio. Based on this factor the initial r anking is 
assigned to the cloud service. 
 
             
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now  this  extracted  keyword  will  work  as  input  to  the  cloud  search  architecture  and  based  on  the  algorithmic  approach  it  will 
return the effective URL list along with ranking.

The  proposed  work  will  be  implemented  in  any  Cloud  Service  based  environment.  We  will  implement  it  in  java  or  .net 
environment. 
 
6. Major Challenges:- 

  Most  of  the  work  in  Cloud  area  is  done  on  the  top  layer  where  the  cloud  servers  exist.  But  any  kind  of  architectural 

change in this layer requires complete reconfiguration of cloud network. 

  Most of the available clouds have their independent architectures and the resources because of this no such  sharing are 

performed between different clouds.  

  Security having lot of flaws in cloud architecture as it is available globally over the net. It requires both the authentication 

and the encoding mechanism to perform the same work. 

  Lot of attacks are there that affects the cloud reliability and efficiency by increasing the unnecessary load on the cloud or 

to reveal the cloud information.

A hybrid cloud is a combination of different methods of resource pooling (for example, combining public and community clouds. 
 
4. Problem Statement:- 
Cloud  is  one  of  the  major  part  of  Web  architecture.  The  cloud  architecture  is  widely  spread  in  the  form  of  public  cloud  and 
available to all the users. There are number of cloud service providers. When a user pass a query for a specific cloud service with 
well specified requirements then a search engine based work is suggested in this research  proposal. In this work at first the user 
query will be analyzed respective to user requirement specification. Now a parametric match will be performed according to the 
user  interest  and  other  parameters.  On  the  basis  of  this  parametric  match  the  ranking  will  be  assigned  to  all  the  eligible  cloud 
services. In this presented work, the ranking criteria are specified on the basis of implicit and explicit properties such as content 
relevancy, user interest and response time etc.

Input: User 

Query 

 
5. DEVELOPMENT SCHEME FOR RANKING:- 
The proposed work is about to optimize the topic based Cloud Service crawling process with the concept of exclusion of duplicate 
pages. For this a new architecture is proposed, this architecture will use the rank based service selection approach. In this work the 
ranking is performed respective main criteria’s called User Interest Analysis. 
The user will interact to the Cloud Service with his topic based query to retrieve the Cloud Service pages. As the page is query 
performed  it  will  perform  request  to  the  Cloud  Service  and  generate  the  basic  URL  list.  Now  it  will  retrieve  the  data  from  the 
Cloud Service. For the URL collection it will use some concepts like indexing and the ranking. The indexing will provide a fast 
access to the Cloud Service page where as ranking will arrange the list according to the priority. 
Now as a Cloud Service page is fetched, the proposed approach  will retrieve the keywords form the document and perform the 
relevancy match by performing the match of service keywords with user  query.  Now as a new page is retrieved it will generate 
the suffix tree and perform a suffix tree based comparison to analyze the relevancy ratio. Based on this factor the initial r anking is 
assigned to the cloud service. 
 
             
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now  this  extracted  keyword  will  work  as  input  to  the  cloud  search  architecture  and  based  on  the  algorithmic  approach  it  will 
return the effective URL list along with ranking.

The  proposed  work  will  be  implemented  in  any  Cloud  Service  based  environment.  We  will  implement  it  in  java  or  .net 
environment. 
 
6. Major Challenges:- 

  Most  of  the  work  in  Cloud  area  is  done  on  the  top  layer  where  the  cloud  servers  exist.  But  any  kind  of  architectural 

change in this layer requires complete reconfiguration of cloud network. 

  Most of the available clouds have their independent architectures and the resources because of this no such  sharing are 

performed between different clouds.  

  Security having lot of flaws in cloud architecture as it is available globally over the net. It requires both the authentication 

and the encoding mechanism to perform the same work. 

  Lot of attacks are there that affects the cloud reliability and efficiency by increasing the unnecessary load on the cloud or 

to reveal the cloud information.

Conclusion:-  
Here  we  motivate  and  solve  the  problem  of  supporting  efficient  ranked  keyword  search  for  achieving  effective  utilization  of 
remotely stored outsourced data in a cloud.  
We  give  problem  statement  and  development  scheme  for  our  ranked  search  mechanism,  including  the  efficient  support  of 
relevance score dynamics. Clouds offer the opportunity to build data observatories with data, software and expertise together to 
solve  problems  such  as  those  associated  with  economic  modeling,  climate  change,  terrorism,  Health  care  and  epidemics  etc. 
Clouds  could  assist  greatly  in  the  e-government  agenda  by  providing  information  in  one  place  to  the  citizen,  together  with 
software  to  manipulate  the  data.  By  enabling  a  search  result  authentication  mechanism  that  can  detect  unexpected  behaviors  of 
cloud server like saving cost when handling large number of search requests, software bugs and internal/external attacks.  
Repository  model  is  used  to  make  the  selection  dynamic.  Further  efficiency  can  be  increased  by  making  slight  change  in 
repository model by introducing cache concept.
