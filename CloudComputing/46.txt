CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-

not  want

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS

accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits 
of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing 
for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows

Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

instead  buy 

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes 
significantly,  for  example  tax  or  billing

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider.

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where

With  the  rapid  development  of  Internet  
andCloud    computing,    there    are    more  
and    more  network    resources.    Sharing,  
management  and on-demand allocation of 
network 
particularly  
important    in    Cloud    computing.IaaS 
(Infrastructure  as  a  service),  as  the  name 
suggests,  provides  you  the  computing 
infrastructure,  physical  or  (quite  often) 
virtual machines and other resources  like 
virtual-machine  disk  image  library,block 
and  file-based  storage,  firewalls,  load 
balancers,IP  addresses,  virtual  local  area 
networks etc.While in Saas(Software as a 
service)  model  you  are  provided  with 
access  to  application  softwares  often 
referred to as on-demand softwares. You 
don't have to worry about the installation, 
setup  and  running  of  the  application. 
Service  provider  will  do  that  for  you. 
You  just  have  to  pay  and  use  it  through 
some  client.PaaS(Platform  as  a  service), 
as  the  name  suggests,  provides  you 
computing  platforms  which 
typically 
includes  operating  system,  programming 
language 
environment, 
database,  web  server  etc.  Platform  as  a 
Service (PaaS) is one of the key  services  
in    Cloud    computing.PaaS    is    very 
attractive for schools, research institutions 
and  enterprises    which    need    reducing

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

a 
decreased  need  for  internal  IT  support

Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing

convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as 
a Service.

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software

organizations  considering  a  move  to  the

to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

With  the  rapid  development  of  Internet  
andCloud    computing,    there    are    more  
and    more  network    resources.    Sharing,  
management  and on-demand allocation of 
network 
particularly  
important    in    Cloud    computing.IaaS 
(Infrastructure  as  a  service),  as  the  name 
suggests,  provides  you  the  computing 
infrastructure,  physical  or  (quite  often) 
virtual machines and other resources  like 
virtual-machine  disk  image  library,block 
and  file-based  storage,  firewalls,  load 
balancers,IP  addresses,  virtual  local  area 
networks etc.While in Saas(Software as a 
service)  model  you  are  provided  with 
access  to  application  softwares  often 
referred to as on-demand softwares. You 
don't have to worry about the installation, 
setup  and  running  of  the  application. 
Service  provider  will  do  that  for  you. 
You  just  have  to  pay  and  use  it  through 
some  client.PaaS(Platform  as  a  service), 
as  the  name  suggests,  provides  you 
computing  platforms  which 
typically 
includes  operating  system,  programming

database,  web  server  etc.  Platform  as  a 
Service (PaaS) is one of the key  services  
in    Cloud    computing.PaaS    is    very 
attractive for schools, research institutions

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits 
of

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

a 
decreased  need  for  internal  IT  support 
staff. 
Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing 
for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as

is 
important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want 
load 
balancers, 
payment-
processing  system.  I  might  not  even  want 
to  run  or  operate  them;  perhaps  all  I  want 
is  to  use  these  services.  Using  SaaS 
vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing. 

40  Sandeep, Niti, Vaibhav

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

Cloud  Computing  generally,  and  SaaS  in 
particular,  is  a  rapidly  growing  method  of

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce 
Relationship

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that 
CRM is the most popular SaaS application

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being 

hosted 

externally  

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

Where IaaS May Not be the Best Option 

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

With  the  rapid  development  of  Internet  
andCloud    computing,    there    are    more  
and    more  network    resources.    Sharing,  
management  and on-demand allocation of 
network 
particularly  
important    in    Cloud    computing.IaaS 
(Infrastructure  as  a  service),  as  the  name 
suggests,  provides  you  the  computing 
infrastructure,  physical  or  (quite  often) 
virtual machines and other resources  like 
virtual-machine  disk  image  library,block 
and  file-based  storage,  firewalls,  load 
balancers,IP  addresses,  virtual  local  area 
networks etc.While in Saas(Software as a 
service)  model  you  are  provided  with 
access  to  application  softwares  often 
referred to as on-demand softwares. You 
don't have to worry about the installation, 
setup  and  running  of  the  application. 
Service  provider  will  do  that  for  you. 
You  just  have  to  pay  and  use  it  through 
some  client.PaaS(Platform  as  a  service), 
as  the  name  suggests,  provides  you 
computing  platforms  which 
typically 
includes  operating  system,  programming 
language 
environment, 
database,  web  server  etc.  Platform  as  a

in    Cloud    computing.PaaS    is    very

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits 
of

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing 
for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as 
a Service.

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want 
load 
balancers, 
payment-
processing  system.  I  might  not  even  want 
to  run  or  operate  them;  perhaps  all  I  want 
is  to  use  these  services.  Using  SaaS 
vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes 
significantly,  for  example  tax  or  billing 
software used once a month

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce 
Relationship

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that 
CRM is the most popular SaaS application

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being 

hosted 

externally  

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

Where IaaS May Not be the Best Option 

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

2.  A  platform  that  allows  for  the  creation

Where PaaS Makes Sense 

PaaS  is  especially  useful  in  any  situation 
where multiple developers will be working 
on  a  development  project  or  where  other 
external  parties  need  to  interact  with  the 
development  process.  As  the  case  study 
below  illustrates,  it  is  proving  invaluable 
for those who have an existing data source 
–  for  example  sales  information  from  a 
customer  relationship  management  tool, 
and  want  to  create  applications  which 
leverage  that  data.  Finally  PaaS  is  useful 
where developers wish to automate testing 
and deployment services.

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits 
of

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing 
for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as 
a Service.

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want

vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

instead  buy 

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes 
significantly,  for  example  tax  or  billing 
software used once a month

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

Characteristics of PaaS

2.  A  platform  that  allows  for  the  creation

an  application.  This  sort  of  PaaS  can  be 
seen  as  a  method  to  create  applications

Where PaaS Makes Sense 

PaaS  is  especially  useful  in  any  situation 
where multiple developers will be working 
on  a  development  project  or  where  other 
external  parties  need  to  interact  with  the 
development  process.  As  the  case  study 
below  illustrates,  it  is  proving  invaluable 
for those who have an existing data source 
–  for  example  sales  information  from  a 
customer  relationship  management  tool, 
and  want  to  create  applications  which 
leverage  that  data.  Finally  PaaS  is  useful 
where developers wish to automate testing 
and deployment services.

Difference between IaaS PaaS 

PaaS,  which  is  similar  in  many  ways  to 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  that  will  be

IaaS  by  the  addition  of  value  added

We  contend  that  PaaS  will  become  the 
predominant  approach  towards  software 
development.  The  ability 
to  automate 
processes, use pre-defined components and 
building  blocks  and  deploy  automatically 
to production will provide sufficient value 
to  be  highly  persuasive.  That  said,  there

With  the  rapid  development  of  Internet

particularly  
important    in    Cloud    computing.IaaS 
(Infrastructure  as  a  service),  as  the  name 
suggests,  provides  you  the  computing

virtual machines and other resources  like 
virtual-machine  disk  image  library,block 
and  file-based  storage,  firewalls,  load

access  to  application  softwares  often 
referred to as on-demand softwares. You 
don't have to worry about the installation, 
setup  and  running  of  the  application.

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits 
of

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

a 
decreased  need  for  internal  IT  support 
staff. 
Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing 
for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as

is 
important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want 
load 
balancers, 
payment-
processing  system.  I  might  not  even  want 
to  run  or  operate  them;  perhaps  all  I  want 
is  to  use  these  services.  Using  SaaS 
vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming 
(APIs)  allow  for

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

Where IaaS May Not be the Best Option 

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

2.  A  platform  that  allows  for  the  creation

seen  as  a  method  to  create  applications

Where PaaS Makes Sense 

PaaS  is  especially  useful  in  any  situation 
where multiple developers will be working 
on  a  development  project  or  where  other 
external  parties  need  to  interact  with  the 
development  process.  As  the  case  study 
below  illustrates,  it  is  proving  invaluable 
for those who have an existing data source 
–  for  example  sales  information  from  a 
customer  relationship  management  tool, 
and  want  to  create  applications  which 
leverage  that  data.  Finally  PaaS  is  useful 
where developers wish to automate testing 
and deployment services.

PaaS,  which  is  similar  in  many  ways  to 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  that  will  be 
discussed  above,  is  differentiated  from 
IaaS  by  the  addition  of  value  added

We  contend  that  PaaS  will  become  the 
predominant  approach  towards  software 
development.  The  ability 
to  automate 
processes, use pre-defined components and 
building  blocks  and  deploy  automatically 
to production will provide sufficient value 
to  be  highly  persuasive.  That  said,  there 
are  certain  situations  where  PaaS  may  not 
be ideal, examples include;

access  to  application  softwares  often 
referred to as on-demand softwares. You 
don't have to worry about the installation,

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing

convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as

important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want

balancers,

to  run  or  operate  them;  perhaps  all  I  want 
is  to  use  these  services.  Using  SaaS 
vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS 
in  fact  comply  with  generally 
accepted  definitions  of  Cloud  Computing.

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software 
upgrades and patches  

•  Application  Programming

particular,  is  a  rapidly  growing  method  of

said, 
organizations  considering  a  move  to  the 
cloud  will  want 
to  consider  which 
applications  they  move  to  SaaS.  As  such 
there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant 
interplay between the organization and the 
outside  world.  For

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect. 

2). Infrastructure as a Service

instead  buy 

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a

hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes

software used once a month

Customer 

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce 
Relationship 
Management  (CRM)  product.  As  one  of 
the earliest entrants it is not surprising that 
CRM is the most popular SaaS application

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being 

hosted 

externally  

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

IaaS makes sense in a number of situations 
and these are closely related to the benefits 
that  Cloud  Computing  bring.  Situations 
that  are  particularly  suitable  for  Cloud 
infrastructure include;

Where IaaS Makes Sense 

IaaS makes sense in a number of situations 
and these are closely related to the benefits 
that  Cloud  Computing  bring.  Situations 
that  are  particularly  suitable  for  Cloud 
infrastructure include; 

•  Where  demand  is  very  volatile  –  any 
time 
there  are  significant  spikes  and

•  For  specific  line  of  business,  trial  or

Where IaaS May Not be the Best Option 

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

Characteristics of PaaS 

There  are  a  number  of  different  takes  on 
what  constitutes  PaaS  but  some  basic 
characteristics include [16];

2.  A  platform  that  allows  for  the  creation 
of software utilizing proprietary data from 
an  application.  This  sort  of  PaaS  can  be 
seen  as  a  method  to  create  applications 
with a common data form or type.

PaaS 

Where PaaS Makes Sense 

PaaS  is  especially  useful  in  any  situation 
where multiple developers will be working 
on  a  development  project  or  where  other 
external  parties  need  to  interact  with  the 
development  process.  As  the  case  study 
below  illustrates,  it  is  proving  invaluable 
for those who have an existing data source 
–  for  example  sales  information  from  a 
customer  relationship  management  tool, 
and  want  to  create  applications  which 
leverage  that  data.  Finally  PaaS  is  useful 
where developers wish to automate testing 
and deployment services.

Difference between IaaS PaaS 

PaaS,  which  is  similar  in  many  ways  to 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  that  will  be

IaaS  by  the  addition  of  value  added

We  contend  that  PaaS  will  become  the 
predominant  approach  towards  software 
development.  The  ability 
to  automate 
processes, use pre-defined components and 
building  blocks  and  deploy  automatically 
to production will provide sufficient value 
to  be  highly  persuasive.  That  said,  there 
are  certain  situations  where  PaaS  may  not 
be ideal, examples include; 

• Where the application needs to be highly 
portable in terms of where it is hosted

CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
 

cloud 

enterprise 

An  Enterprise  Cloud 
is  a  hosted 
computing  environment  that  delivers 
software,  platform  or  infrastructure 
services 
to  business  users  via  a 
network.  Enterprise  Cloud  Computing 
provides  organizations  with  the  ability 
to  deliver  computing  services  in  a 
controlled  and  secure  manner,  since  a 
cloud for the enterprise makes use of a 
network  firewall.  Entities  that  store, 
mange  or  process  sensitive  data, 
including  government  agencies  and 
health  care  organizations,  are  likely  to 
use 
computing 
services,  as  opposed  to  using  public 
cloud computing services. 
Many businesses who own on-premise 
IT  systems  can  maximize  their  IT 
investment  through  Enterprise  Cloud 
Computing. A Cloud for the Enterprise 
promises to deliver  an  extremely  agile 
computing environment for client users 
within  private  organizations.  These 
organizations  can  gain  many  of  the 
same  operational  benefits  available 
within  a  public  cloud  computing 
environment.  Extending  a  private 
cloud  that  incorporates  methods  such 
as  virtualization,  automation  and 
service  management;  can  result  in 
increased operational efficiency within 
an organization. 
Implementing an Enterprise Cloud 

Enterprise  Cloud  Computing  can  be 
implemented in one of two ways: as a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  on  the 
premises  of  an  organization;  or  as  a 
private  cloud  that  is  hosted  externally 
by 
provider. 
Organizations 
that  use  externally 
hosted  enterprise  cloud  computing 
services  often  experience  the  benefits

benefit  of  externally  hosted  enterprise 
cloud  computing  services  is  lower  IT

a 
decreased  need  for  internal  IT  support

Some organizations gain the benefits of

a 
configuration,  organizations  internally 
host  their  more  sensitive  applications 
that require a highly secure computing 
environment  and  move  applications 
with 
security 
requirements  to  an  externally  hosted 
cloud  for  the  enterprise.  A  hybrid 
enterprise 
computing 
environment  typically  uses  a  cloud 
management  interface,  to  provide  a 
coherent  platform  for  enterprise  cloud 
service  delivery.  Cloud  management 
methods require the establishment of a 
cloud  as  a  platform,  where  an 
enterprise  can  provide  hybrid  cloud 
computing  services  on  demand  from 
existing  IT  systems  and  processes. 
Cloud  management  software  provides 
a  platform  to  easily  register  users, 
create  work  group  services  profiles, 
manage virtual resources and more. 
CLOUD COMPUTING AS STACK 
Cloud  Computing  is  often  described  as  a 
stack,  as  a  response  to  the  broad  range  of 
services  built  on  top  of  one  another  under 
the  moniker  “Cloud”.  The  generally 
accepted  definition  of  Cloud  Computing 
comes  from 
the  National  Institute  of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [1]. The 
NIST  definition  runs  to  several  hundred 
words  [2]  but  essentially  says  that; Cloud 
computing

convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to 
a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing

resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage, 
applications,  and  services)  that  can  be 
rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service 
provider  interaction.  The  diagram  below 
depicts  the  Cloud  Computing  stack  –  it 
shows 
three  distinct  categories  within 
Cloud  Computing:  Software  as  a  Service, 
Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as 
a Service.

is 
important  to  note  that  the  SaaS  software 
provided by a vendor might not be running 
in  a  cloud,  but  SaaS  offerings  often  make 
sense  when  developing  an  application  for 
the  cloud.  For  instance,  if  I  develop  an  e-
commerce  solution  in  the  cloud,  I  might 
not  want 
load 
balancers, 
payment-
processing  system.  I  might  not  even  want 
to  run  or  operate  them;  perhaps  all  I  want 
is  to  use  these  services.  Using  SaaS 
vendors  allows  me  to  concentrate  on  my 
own application.

1.a) Characteristics of SaaS 

Like other forms of Cloud Computing, it is 
important  to  ensure  that  solutions  sold  as 
SaaS

Some  defining  characteristics  of  SaaS 
include; 

• Web access to commercial software  

•  Software  is  managed  from  a  central 
location  

•  Software  delivered  in  a  “one  to  many” 
model  

•  Users  not  required  to  handle  software

organizations  considering  a  move  to  the

to  consider  which

there  are  particular  solutions  we  consider 
prime  candidate  for  an  initial  move  to 
SaaS; 

• “Vanilla” offerings where the solution is 
largely  undifferentiated.  A  good  example 
of  a  vanilla  offering  would  include  email 
where  many  times  competitors  use  the 
same  software  precisely  because 
this 
fundamental  technology  is  a  requirement 
for  doing  business,  but  does  not  itself 
confer an competitive advantage 

•  Applications  where  there  is  significant

Software  as  a  Service  may  be  the  best 

known  aspect  of  Cloud  Computing,  but 

developers  and  organizations  all  around 

the  world  are  leveraging  Platform  as  a 

Service,  which  mixes  the  simplicity  of 

SaaS  with  the  power  of  IaaS,  to  great 

effect.

instead  buy 

Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS) is  a way 
of 
Computing 
infrastructure  –  servers,  storage,  network 
and  operating  systems  –  as  an  on-demand 
service.  Rather  than  purchasing  servers, 
software,  datacenter  space  or  network 
equipment,  clients 
those 
resources  as  a  fully  outsourced  service  on 
demand.  As  we  detailed  in  a  previous 
whitepaper,  within  IaaS,  there  are  some 
sub-categories 
that  are  worth  noting. 
Generally  IaaS  can  be  obtained  as  public 
or  private  infrastructure  or  a  combination 
of  the  two.  “Public  cloud”  is  considered 
infrastructure 
that  consists  of  shared 
resources, deployed on a self-service basis 
over  the  Internet.  By  contrast,  “private 
cloud” is infrastructure that emulates some 
of  Cloud  Computing 
like 
virtualization,  but  does  so  on  a  private 
network.  Additionally, 
some  hosting 
providers  are  beginning 
to  offer  a 
combination  of 
traditional  dedicated 
hosting  alongside  public  and/  or  private

Characteristics of IaaS 

As  with  the  two  previous  sections,  SaaS 
and  PaaS,  IaaS  is  a  rapidly  developing 
field.  That  said  there  are  some  core 
characteristics  which  describe  what  IaaS 
is.  IaaS  is  generally  accepted  to  comply 
with the following; 

 

 
• Applications that have a significant need 
for  web  or  mobile  access.  An  example 
would  be  mobile  sales  management 
software  

•  Software  that  is  only  to  be  used  for  a 
short  term  need.  An  example  would  be 
collaboration  software 
for  a  specific 
project  

•  Software  where 
spikes 
significantly,  for  example  tax  or  billing 
software used once a month

SaaS  is  widely  accepted  to  have  been 
introduced  to  the  business  world  by  the 
Salesforce

the earliest entrants it is not surprising that 
CRM is the most popular SaaS application

1.c)  Where  SaaS  May  Not  be  the  Best 

Option 

While  SaaS  is  a  very  valuable  tool,  there 

are certain situations where we believe it is 

not  the  best  option  for  software  delivery. 

Examples  where  SaaS  may  not  be 

appropriate include; 

•  Applications  where  extremely 

fast 

processing  of  real  time  data  is  required  

•  Applications  where  legislation  or  other 

regulation  does  not  permit  data  being 

hosted 

externally  

•  Applications  where  an  existing  on-

Where IaaS May Not be the Best Option 

While  IaaS  provides  massive  advantages 
for  situations  where  scalability  and  quick 
provisioning  are  beneficial, 
there  are 
situations  where  its  limitations  may  be 
problematic. Examples of situations where 
we would advise caution with regards IaaS 
include; 

•  Where  regulatory  compliance  makes  the 
offshoring  or  outsourcing  of  data  storage 
and processing difficult  

• Where the highest levels of performance 
are  required,  and  on-premise  or  dedicated 
hosted  infrastructure  has  the  capacity  to 
meet the organization’s needs

Characteristics of PaaS 

There  are  a  number  of  different  takes  on 
what  constitutes  PaaS  but  some  basic 
characteristics include [16];

2.  A  platform  that  allows  for  the  creation 
of software utilizing proprietary data from 
an  application.  This  sort  of  PaaS  can  be 
seen  as  a  method  to  create  applications 
with a common data form or type.

PaaS 

Where PaaS Makes Sense 

PaaS  is  especially  useful  in  any  situation 
where multiple developers will be working 
on  a  development  project  or  where  other 
external  parties  need  to  interact  with  the 
development  process.  As  the  case  study 
below  illustrates,  it  is  proving  invaluable 
for those who have an existing data source 
–  for  example  sales  information  from  a 
customer  relationship  management  tool, 
and  want  to  create  applications  which 
leverage  that  data.  Finally  PaaS  is  useful 
where developers wish to automate testing 
and deployment services.

Difference between IaaS PaaS 

PaaS,  which  is  similar  in  many  ways  to

We  contend  that  PaaS  will  become  the 
predominant  approach  towards  software 
development.  The  ability 
to  automate 
processes, use pre-defined components and 
building  blocks  and  deploy  automatically 
to production will provide sufficient value 
to  be  highly  persuasive.  That  said,  there 
are  certain  situations  where  PaaS  may  not 
be ideal, examples include;

CONCLUSION 

improve 

In  this  paper,  a  framework  implementing 
and  managing  platform  as  a  service  in  a 
virtual  Cloud  computing  lab  is  developed. 
The  system  has  good  expandability  and 
can 
resource’s  sharing  and 
utilization. In the future we will extend the 
framework to include imaging of software 
and  hardware  platforms,  load  balancing 
and  complete  automatic  provisioning  of 
resources so that the system can be applied 
in large-scale and distributed environment.
