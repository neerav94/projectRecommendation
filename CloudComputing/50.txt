ABSTRACT 
 

 

With increasing advances in technology, there's a need to 
learn and use new technologies. Necessity of e-banking, and 
mainly  internet  banking  and  their  importance  and  role  in 
decreasing distances and increasing service providing speed 
is  obvious  but  impose  many  challenges  to  executives. 
Prevailing over people's distrust to the internet is one of these 
challenges that could be achieved with assuring security and 
privacy of user in internet and reducing faults. At the other 
hand,  providing  all  infrastructures  and  tools  needed  in 
e-banking area violate cost limitations and require a great part 
of overall budget. Cloud computing is one of technologies that 
provide  scalable  and  flexible  resources  via  internet  –  that 
could  be  accessible  everywhere  –  using  pay-for-per-use 
approach,  and  have  a  great  role  in  reducing  businesses' 
information technology costs. 

In  this  paper  a  Single  Sign-On(SSO)  based  integrated 
model for e-banking services is proposed that besides assuring 
more  security,  and  reducing  costs  using  cloud  computing 
services,  provides  centralized  management,  simplicity  and 
reduced faults.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Lack of  secure  infrastructures  for  electronic  interchanges 
and dispersed behavior of banks at internet area, are problems 
that e-banking technology is encountering in Iran. Source of 
such  problems  is  in  lack  of  integrity  in  internet  banking 
domain. Variety of debit cards and payment gateways make 
users  memorize  numerous  combinations  of  card  numbers, 
PIN2s, CVV2s, or usernames and passwords  –  that lead to 
confusion. Although people think this makes them secure, but 
issuing  different  identifiers  for  a  unique  identity  hazards 
his/her  security,  because  most  people  due  to  inability  to 
memorize,  write  down  their  identifiers  to  somewhere  that 
other people could see. 

A unified  authentication and authorization system that is 
supervised by central bank and issues unique certificates, and

obligation to be authorized from this system in order to do 
internet  and  interbank  transactions,  rescue  users  from 
multiple  authentications  and  multiple  identifiers'  issues. 
Users do their transactions with less apprehension and more 
security. 

 
One  of  the  other  burdens  of  e-banking  development  is 
budget limitations, because buying all needed infrastructures 
impose high costs. An option is to rent needed resources from 
other parties. Cloud computing is a novel technology that is 
presented  in  order  to  reduce  IT  costs  for  businesses,  and 
provides  required  resources  and  infrastructures  everywhere 
and every time is needed, with nominal cost. Although using 
cloud computing services reduce costs, but due to use of web 
as base medium to deliver services, require more security [3]. 

 
At the other hand, proper communication between different 
banks,  or  between  banks  and  businesses  which  use  their 
payment  services,  and  to  get  more  integrity,  a  centralized 
system is needed to shorten  transaction  time,  reduce  faults 
while forwarding transactions, and profit more auditability. 

 
Many unified  and  secure  authentication  mechanisms  and 
approaches  there  exist  [2],  [4],  and  [8].  But  considering 
mentioned  needs  and  weaknesses  at  e-banking  and  cloud 
computing  areas,  we  propose  a  model  which  combining 
advantages  of  cloud  computing,  single  sign-on  and  core 
banking  system,  in  addition  to  reducing  costs,  increasing 
security  and  integrity,  provides  more  user-friendliness  for 
e-banking services.

2.1 Cloud Computing 
 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service 
rather  than  a  product,  whereby  shared  resources,  software, 
and information are provided to computers and other devices 
as a utility over a network. Cloud computing describes a new 
supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services 
based  on  Internet  protocols,  and  it  typically  involves 

Ali Abdollahi  et al., International Journal of  Advances in Computer Science and Technology, 3(1), January 2014, 34 - 38 

 

provisioning  of  dynamically  scalable  and  often  virtualized 
resources.  It  is  a  byproduct  and  consequence  of  the 
ease-of-access  to  remote  computing  sites  provided  by  the 
Internet.  This  may  take  the  form  of  web-based  tools  or 
applications  that  users  can  access  and  use  through  a  web 
browser, as if the programs were installed locally on their own 
computers.  Cloud computing providers deliver  applications 
via the internet, which are accessed from web browsers and 
desktop  and  mobile  apps,  while  the  business  software  and 
data  are  stored  on  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Table  1 
presents an overview of cloud systems. 
 
2.1.1 Service models 
 

It is generally supposed that there are three basic types of 

cloud computing services: 

 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In IaaS, CPU, grids or 
clusters, virtualized servers, memory, networks, storage and 
systems software are delivered as a service. 

 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides virtualized 
servers on which users can run applications, or develop new 
ones,  without  having  to  worry  about  maintaining  the 
operating  systems,  server  hardware,  load  balancing  or 
computing capacity. 

Internet.  Unlike 

 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  SaaS  is  software  that  is 
developed and hosted by the SaaS vendor and which the end 
user  accesses  over 
traditional 
applications that users install on their computers or servers, 
SaaS software is owned by the vendor and runs on computers 
in the vendor’s data center (or a co-location facility). Broadly 
speaking,  all  customers  of  a  SaaS  vendor  use  the  same 
software: these are one-size-fits-all solutions. 
2.1.2 Deployment models 

the 

 
There are generally four types of Cloud deployment models: 

Private  cloud:  Private  cloud  is  infrastructure  operated 
solely for a single organization, whether managed internally 
or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally.

reduction,  ease  of  use, 

Private, Community, Public, Hybrid 

 

 

Community cloud: Community cloud shares infrastructure 
between  several  organizations  from  a  specific  community 
with  common  concerns  (security,  compliance,  jurisdiction, 
etc.),  whether  managed  internally  or  by  a  third-party  and 
hosted  internally  or  externally.  The  costs  are  spread  over 
fewer  users  than  a  public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  private 
cloud), so only some of the benefits of cloud computing are 
realized. 
 

Public cloud: A public cloud is one based on the standard 
cloud computing model, in which a service provider makes 
resources, such as applications and storage, available to the 
general public over the Internet. Public cloud services may be 
free or offered on a pay-per-usage model. 
 

Hybrid  cloud:  Hybrid  cloud  is  a  composition  of  two  or 
more  clouds  (private,  community,  or  public)  that  remain 
unique entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of 
multiple  deployment  models.  It  can  also  be  defined  as 
multiple cloud systems that are connected in a way that allows 
programs and data to be moved easily from one deployment 
system to another. 
 

Compared  to  other  distributed  systems  such  as  grids  or 
clusters,  cloud  computing  solutions  give  enterprises 
significantly  more  flexibility.  They  can  dispense  with  IT 
infrastructures  of  their  own  and  only  have  to  pay  for  the 
resources  and  services  they  actually  use.  These  can  be 
dynamically adapted to changed business requirements and 
processes  with  the  help  of  virtualization  technologies  and 
service oriented, distributed software systems. 

 
At the same time, the use of cloud computing systems also 
involves a number of security risks – most of them linked to 
the insufficient use of, and support for, security technologies. 
Yet-to-be-developed or immature technologies can likewise 
lead to security deficiencies in cloud computing systems. As a 
result, the use of cloud computing systems is still restricted, 
and  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  potential  security  risks  is 
essential because users expect secure cloud services to comply 
with the same high security standards as the systems used in 
the past. These risks can have a significant influence on the 
end  user’s  business  model  –  for  instance,  if  confidential 
information is stolen [9]. 
 
2.2 Single Sign-on 
 

SSO system (Figure 1) provides users a centralized access to 
different systems using one identity and one authentication 
process,  without  need  to  multiple  authentications  and 
authorizations for every single application system. 
 

Using SSO has these advantages: 
 

-  Less need to various combinations of usernames and 

passwords

Core banking system is a kind of banking system in which 
all financial information and transactions of banking network 
are saved and recorded at a central information unit. Such a 
system is used to satisfy strategic financial policies in order to 
improve operations, reduce costs, and make opportunities for 
banking businesses to mature. 

Core  banking  system  presents  all  banking  products  and 
services,  and  their  steering  and  management  operations, 
using shared databases centralized as a whole. Flexibility and 
customer-orientation  are  key  characteristics  of  this  system. 
Without  creating  a  centralized  and  integrated  database, 
e-banking  services  will  be  at  a  dispersed  manner.  In  a 
centralized  modular  banking  system  based  on  new 
technologies, component based software makes it possible to 
integrate with traditional banking technologies. Development 
of core banking system has these advantages: 

 

 

  Customer satisfaction due to variety of products and 

services 

  Higher operational output 
  Higher efficiency and output of human resources 
  Management of operation and maintenance costs 
  Centralized product management 
  Centralized  Customer  Relationship  Management 

(CRM) 

  Centralized accounting 
  Centralized monitoring 
  Centralized marketing management 

Propagation of electronic services based on core banking, 
results  in  high  Return  on  Investment  (ROI)  and  facilitates 
resource  planning,  because  buying  branches  for  banks  and 
attendance of customers in bank branches is expensive. 
 
3.  PROPOSED MODEL 
 

In  our  proposed  model,  relying  on  functionalities  and 
advantages  of  core  banking  and  SSO  systems,  and 
aggregating these systems, we combined their functionalities 
and  presented  an 
integrated  system  with  centralized 
management. Core banking system is used for integration of 
payment  methods  in  e-banking.  SSO  is  used  in  order  to 
integrate authentication process for this system. And cloud 
computing is used as a fundamental technology in order to 
reduce  system  development  costs  and  time.  Since  cloud 
computing provides services in infrastructure, platform and 
software  layers,  everywhere  cost  is  a  limitation  for  system 
development, we could profit its services.

ABSTRACT 
 

 

With increasing advances in technology, there's a need to 
learn and use new technologies. Necessity of e-banking, and 
mainly  internet  banking  and  their  importance  and  role  in 
decreasing distances and increasing service providing speed 
is  obvious  but  impose  many  challenges  to  executives. 
Prevailing over people's distrust to the internet is one of these 
challenges that could be achieved with assuring security and 
privacy of user in internet and reducing faults. At the other 
hand,  providing  all  infrastructures  and  tools  needed  in 
e-banking area violate cost limitations and require a great part 
of overall budget. Cloud computing is one of technologies that 
provide  scalable  and  flexible  resources  via  internet  –  that 
could  be  accessible  everywhere  –  using  pay-for-per-use 
approach,  and  have  a  great  role  in  reducing  businesses' 
information technology costs. 

In  this  paper  a  Single  Sign-On(SSO)  based  integrated 
model for e-banking services is proposed that besides assuring 
more  security,  and  reducing  costs  using  cloud  computing 
services,  provides  centralized  management,  simplicity  and 
reduced faults. 

Key words: E-banking, Cloud Computing, Security, Integrity, 
Single Sign-On (SSO), Core Banking. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Lack of  secure  infrastructures  for  electronic  interchanges 
and dispersed behavior of banks at internet area, are problems 
that e-banking technology is encountering in Iran. Source of 
such  problems  is  in  lack  of  integrity  in  internet  banking 
domain. Variety of debit cards and payment gateways make 
users  memorize  numerous  combinations  of  card  numbers, 
PIN2s, CVV2s, or usernames and passwords  –  that lead to 
confusion. Although people think this makes them secure, but 
issuing  different  identifiers  for  a  unique  identity  hazards 
his/her  security,  because  most  people  due  to  inability  to 
memorize,  write  down  their  identifiers  to  somewhere  that 
other people could see. 

A unified  authentication and authorization system that is 
supervised by central bank and issues unique certificates, and 
 
 

 

34 

obligation to be authorized from this system in order to do 
internet  and  interbank  transactions,  rescue  users  from 
multiple  authentications  and  multiple  identifiers'  issues. 
Users do their transactions with less apprehension and more 
security. 

 
One  of  the  other  burdens  of  e-banking  development  is 
budget limitations, because buying all needed infrastructures 
impose high costs. An option is to rent needed resources from 
other parties. Cloud computing is a novel technology that is 
presented  in  order  to  reduce  IT  costs  for  businesses,  and 
provides  required  resources  and  infrastructures  everywhere 
and every time is needed, with nominal cost. Although using 
cloud computing services reduce costs, but due to use of web 
as base medium to deliver services, require more security [3]. 

 
At the other hand, proper communication between different 
banks,  or  between  banks  and  businesses  which  use  their 
payment  services,  and  to  get  more  integrity,  a  centralized 
system is needed to shorten  transaction  time,  reduce  faults 
while forwarding transactions, and profit more auditability. 

 
Many unified  and  secure  authentication  mechanisms  and 
approaches  there  exist  [2],  [4],  and  [8].  But  considering 
mentioned  needs  and  weaknesses  at  e-banking  and  cloud 
computing  areas,  we  propose  a  model  which  combining 
advantages  of  cloud  computing,  single  sign-on  and  core 
banking  system,  in  addition  to  reducing  costs,  increasing 
security  and  integrity,  provides  more  user-friendliness  for 
e-banking services. 

Section 2 briefly explains cloud computing, single sign-on 
and  core  banking  concepts,  section  3  describes  proposed 
model, and a conclusion is presented in section 4. 
 
2. PRIMARY CONCEPTS 
 
2.1 Cloud Computing 
 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service 
rather  than  a  product,  whereby  shared  resources,  software, 
and information are provided to computers and other devices 
as a utility over a network. Cloud computing describes a new 
supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services 
based  on  Internet  protocols,  and  it  typically  involves 

Ali Abdollahi  et al., International Journal of  Advances in Computer Science and Technology, 3(1), January 2014, 34 - 38 

 

provisioning  of  dynamically  scalable  and  often  virtualized 
resources.  It  is  a  byproduct  and  consequence  of  the 
ease-of-access  to  remote  computing  sites  provided  by  the 
Internet.  This  may  take  the  form  of  web-based  tools  or 
applications  that  users  can  access  and  use  through  a  web 
browser, as if the programs were installed locally on their own 
computers.  Cloud computing providers deliver  applications 
via the internet, which are accessed from web browsers and 
desktop  and  mobile  apps,  while  the  business  software  and 
data  are  stored  on  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Table  1 
presents an overview of cloud systems. 
 
2.1.1 Service models 
 

It is generally supposed that there are three basic types of 

cloud computing services: 

 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In IaaS, CPU, grids or 
clusters, virtualized servers, memory, networks, storage and 
systems software are delivered as a service. 

 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides virtualized 
servers on which users can run applications, or develop new 
ones,  without  having  to  worry  about  maintaining  the 
operating  systems,  server  hardware,  load  balancing  or 
computing capacity. 

Internet.  Unlike 

 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  SaaS  is  software  that  is 
developed and hosted by the SaaS vendor and which the end 
user  accesses  over 
traditional 
applications that users install on their computers or servers, 
SaaS software is owned by the vendor and runs on computers 
in the vendor’s data center (or a co-location facility). Broadly 
speaking,  all  customers  of  a  SaaS  vendor  use  the  same 
software: these are one-size-fits-all solutions. 
2.1.2 Deployment models 

the 

 
There are generally four types of Cloud deployment models: 

Private  cloud:  Private  cloud  is  infrastructure  operated 
solely for a single organization, whether managed internally 
or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally. 
 

Stakeholders  Users, Adopters, Resellers, Providers, … 

Locality 
Compares to  Grid,  Service-Oriented  Architecture, 

Local, Remote, Distributed

reduction,  ease  of  use, 

Private, Community, Public, Hybrid 

 

 

Community cloud: Community cloud shares infrastructure 
between  several  organizations  from  a  specific  community 
with  common  concerns  (security,  compliance,  jurisdiction, 
etc.),  whether  managed  internally  or  by  a  third-party  and 
hosted  internally  or  externally.  The  costs  are  spread  over 
fewer  users  than  a  public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  private 
cloud), so only some of the benefits of cloud computing are 
realized. 
 

Public cloud: A public cloud is one based on the standard 
cloud computing model, in which a service provider makes 
resources, such as applications and storage, available to the 
general public over the Internet. Public cloud services may be 
free or offered on a pay-per-usage model. 
 

Hybrid  cloud:  Hybrid  cloud  is  a  composition  of  two  or 
more  clouds  (private,  community,  or  public)  that  remain 
unique entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of 
multiple  deployment  models.  It  can  also  be  defined  as 
multiple cloud systems that are connected in a way that allows 
programs and data to be moved easily from one deployment 
system to another. 
 

Compared  to  other  distributed  systems  such  as  grids  or 
clusters,  cloud  computing  solutions  give  enterprises 
significantly  more  flexibility.  They  can  dispense  with  IT 
infrastructures  of  their  own  and  only  have  to  pay  for  the 
resources  and  services  they  actually  use.  These  can  be 
dynamically adapted to changed business requirements and 
processes  with  the  help  of  virtualization  technologies  and 
service oriented, distributed software systems. 

 
At the same time, the use of cloud computing systems also 
involves a number of security risks – most of them linked to 
the insufficient use of, and support for, security technologies. 
Yet-to-be-developed or immature technologies can likewise 
lead to security deficiencies in cloud computing systems. As a 
result, the use of cloud computing systems is still restricted, 
and  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  potential  security  risks  is 
essential because users expect secure cloud services to comply 
with the same high security standards as the systems used in 
the past. These risks can have a significant influence on the 
end  user’s  business  model  –  for  instance,  if  confidential 
information is stolen [9]. 
 
2.2 Single Sign-on 
 

SSO system (Figure 1) provides users a centralized access to 
different systems using one identity and one authentication 
process,  without  need  to  multiple  authentications  and 
authorizations for every single application system. 
 

Using SSO has these advantages: 
 

-  Less need to various combinations of usernames and 

passwords

Core banking system is a kind of banking system in which 
all financial information and transactions of banking network 
are saved and recorded at a central information unit. Such a 
system is used to satisfy strategic financial policies in order to 
improve operations, reduce costs, and make opportunities for 
banking businesses to mature. 

Core  banking  system  presents  all  banking  products  and 
services,  and  their  steering  and  management  operations, 
using shared databases centralized as a whole. Flexibility and 
customer-orientation  are  key  characteristics  of  this  system. 
Without  creating  a  centralized  and  integrated  database, 
e-banking  services  will  be  at  a  dispersed  manner.  In  a 
centralized  modular  banking  system  based  on  new 
technologies, component based software makes it possible to 
integrate with traditional banking technologies. Development 
of core banking system has these advantages: 

 

 

  Customer satisfaction due to variety of products and 

services 

  Higher operational output 
  Higher efficiency and output of human resources 
  Management of operation and maintenance costs 
  Centralized product management 
  Centralized  Customer  Relationship  Management 

(CRM) 

  Centralized accounting 
  Centralized monitoring 
  Centralized marketing management 

Propagation of electronic services based on core banking, 
results  in  high  Return  on  Investment  (ROI)  and  facilitates 
resource  planning,  because  buying  branches  for  banks  and 
attendance of customers in bank branches is expensive. 
 
3.  PROPOSED MODEL 
 

In  our  proposed  model,  relying  on  functionalities  and 
advantages  of  core  banking  and  SSO  systems,  and 
aggregating these systems, we combined their functionalities 
and  presented  an 
integrated  system  with  centralized

payment  methods  in  e-banking.  SSO  is  used  in  order  to 
integrate authentication process for this system. And cloud 
computing is used as a fundamental technology in order to 
reduce  system  development  costs  and  time.  Since  cloud

In order to assure more security for banking system, private 
cloud deployment model is used to profit SSO-as-a-Service 
and Core Banking-as-a-Service. Of course access to the cloud 
is done via cloud agent that takes care of cloud security.

In SSO based system, user is identified by a unique identity 
and uses a unique gateway to facilitate payment services of all 
banks.  Certificate  Authority  (CA) 
issues  unique 
certificate or identity for every party or person, works under 
supervision  of  central  bank  but  can  use  different 
authentication  mechanisms.  But, 
to  satisfy 
non-repudiation  –  that  is  one  of  the  fundamental  security 
requirements  of  a  secure  internet  payment  system  [5]  – 
authentication mechanism should include digital signatures. 
The unique identity depending on authentication mechanism 
could be at forms of username and password pairs, signature 
cards [6], etc.

Structure  of  an  online  banking  system  is  commonly 
composed  of  five  elements:  user,  internet,  bank's  server, 
authentication,  and  transactions  [7].  In  another  view,  this 
system  is  composed  of  three  elements:  customer  network, 
internet,  and  bank  server  and  private  network  [4].  In  our 
model

authentication and authorization, user signs in core banking 
system and requests for transactions. Depending on his/her 
certificate, these transactions could be performed or rejected. 
After searching  core banking transactions database, system 
performs  transactions  if  performable,  and  saves  them  in 
transactions database. Finally, these changes will be saved in 
banks' database. 

All  banks,  merchants,  service  providers,  and  third  party 
enterprises which need payment system, are connected to core 
banking system and recognize user's unique identity, and user 
has no need to be authenticated by every system again. 
 

Tracking and auditing of transactions require just searching 
for one identifier per identity in SSO database, and checking 
transactions related to this identity in centralized transactions 
database. Such an auditing is simpler and faster than existing 
systems. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
 

In this paper, a secure integrated model based on SSO and 
core banking system for providing e-banking services through 
cloud  computing  presented  that  speeds  up  and  simplifies 
transactions by centralizing and aggregating e-payment rules.

With increasing advances in technology, there's a need to 
learn and use new technologies. Necessity of e-banking, and 
mainly  internet  banking  and  their  importance  and  role  in

is  obvious  but  impose  many  challenges  to  executives.

In  this  paper  a  Single  Sign-On(SSO)  based  integrated

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Lack of  secure  infrastructures  for  electronic  interchanges 
and dispersed behavior of banks at internet area, are problems 
that e-banking technology is encountering in Iran. Source of 
such  problems  is  in  lack  of  integrity  in  internet  banking 
domain. Variety of debit cards and payment gateways make 
users  memorize  numerous  combinations  of  card  numbers, 
PIN2s, CVV2s, or usernames and passwords  –  that lead to 
confusion. Although people think this makes them secure, but 
issuing  different  identifiers  for  a  unique  identity  hazards 
his/her  security,  because  most  people  due  to  inability  to

internet  and  interbank  transactions,  rescue  users  from 
multiple  authentications  and  multiple  identifiers'  issues. 
Users do their transactions with less apprehension and more 
security. 

 
One  of  the  other  burdens  of  e-banking  development  is 
budget limitations, because buying all needed infrastructures 
impose high costs. An option is to rent needed resources from

and every time is needed, with nominal cost. Although using 
cloud computing services reduce costs, but due to use of web 
as base medium to deliver services, require more security [3]. 

 
At the other hand, proper communication between different

payment  services,  and  to  get  more  integrity,  a  centralized 
system is needed to shorten  transaction  time,  reduce  faults

Many unified  and  secure  authentication  mechanisms  and 
approaches  there  exist  [2],  [4],  and  [8].  But  considering

rather  than  a  product,  whereby  shared  resources,  software, 
and information are provided to computers and other devices 
as a utility over a network. Cloud computing describes a new 
supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services 
based  on  Internet  protocols,  and  it  typically  involves

provisioning  of  dynamically  scalable  and  often  virtualized 
resources.  It  is  a  byproduct  and  consequence  of  the 
ease-of-access  to  remote  computing  sites  provided  by  the 
Internet.  This  may  take  the  form  of  web-based  tools  or 
applications  that  users  can  access  and  use  through  a  web 
browser, as if the programs were installed locally on their own

via the internet, which are accessed from web browsers and 
desktop  and  mobile  apps,  while  the  business  software  and 
data  are  stored  on  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Table  1 
presents an overview of cloud systems. 
 
2.1.1 Service models

cloud computing services: 

 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In IaaS, CPU, grids or 
clusters, virtualized servers, memory, networks, storage and 
systems software are delivered as a service. 

 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides virtualized 
servers on which users can run applications, or develop new 
ones,  without  having  to  worry  about  maintaining  the 
operating  systems,  server  hardware,  load  balancing  or

SaaS software is owned by the vendor and runs on computers 
in the vendor’s data center (or a co-location facility). Broadly 
speaking,  all  customers  of  a  SaaS  vendor  use  the  same 
software: these are one-size-fits-all solutions. 
2.1.2 Deployment models

with  common  concerns  (security,  compliance,  jurisdiction, 
etc.),  whether  managed  internally  or  by  a  third-party  and 
hosted  internally  or  externally.  The  costs  are  spread  over 
fewer  users  than  a  public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  private 
cloud), so only some of the benefits of cloud computing are 
realized. 
 

Public cloud: A public cloud is one based on the standard 
cloud computing model, in which a service provider makes 
resources, such as applications and storage, available to the 
general public over the Internet. Public cloud services may be 
free or offered on a pay-per-usage model. 
 

Hybrid  cloud:  Hybrid  cloud  is  a  composition  of  two  or 
more  clouds  (private,  community,  or  public)  that  remain 
unique entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of 
multiple  deployment  models.  It  can  also  be  defined  as 
multiple cloud systems that are connected in a way that allows 
programs and data to be moved easily from one deployment 
system to another. 
 

Compared  to  other  distributed  systems  such  as  grids  or 
clusters,  cloud  computing  solutions  give  enterprises 
significantly  more  flexibility.  They  can  dispense  with  IT 
infrastructures  of  their  own  and  only  have  to  pay  for  the 
resources  and  services  they  actually  use.  These  can  be 
dynamically adapted to changed business requirements and 
processes  with  the  help  of  virtualization  technologies  and 
service oriented, distributed software systems. 

 
At the same time, the use of cloud computing systems also 
involves a number of security risks – most of them linked to 
the insufficient use of, and support for, security technologies. 
Yet-to-be-developed or immature technologies can likewise 
lead to security deficiencies in cloud computing systems. As a 
result, the use of cloud computing systems is still restricted, 
and  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  potential  security  risks  is 
essential because users expect secure cloud services to comply 
with the same high security standards as the systems used in 
the past. These risks can have a significant influence on the 
end  user’s  business  model  –  for  instance,  if  confidential 
information is stolen [9]. 
 
2.2 Single Sign-on 
 

SSO system (Figure 1) provides users a centralized access to 
different systems using one identity and one authentication 
process,  without  need  to  multiple  authentications  and 
authorizations for every single application system. 
 

Using SSO has these advantages: 
 

-  Less need to various combinations of usernames and 

passwords

According to [1], sequence diagram of authentication and 
authorization process in SSO system is summarized in Figure 
2. Steps of this process are: 

1) Access request to application from user 
2) Sign in request, or request to fill sign up form if not 

registered yet 

3) Signing in, or filling sign up form and submitting to 

authentication system 

4) Issuing unique ID for user and registration of this ID 
in system database, or search for registered user in 
authentication system database 

5) User  authorization  and  notification  to  user,  or 
unauthorization and notification for denial of access 

6) Sending user ID to application 
7) Creating  access 

to 
application for this user ID 
8) Sending access link to user 
9) User access to requested application

Core banking system is a kind of banking system in which 
all financial information and transactions of banking network 
are saved and recorded at a central information unit. Such a 
system is used to satisfy strategic financial policies in order to 
improve operations, reduce costs, and make opportunities for 
banking businesses to mature. 

Core  banking  system  presents  all  banking  products  and 
services,  and  their  steering  and  management  operations, 
using shared databases centralized as a whole. Flexibility and 
customer-orientation  are  key  characteristics  of  this  system. 
Without  creating  a  centralized  and  integrated  database, 
e-banking  services  will  be  at  a  dispersed  manner.  In  a 
centralized  modular  banking  system  based  on  new 
technologies, component based software makes it possible to 
integrate with traditional banking technologies. Development 
of core banking system has these advantages: 

 

 

  Customer satisfaction due to variety of products and 

services 

  Higher operational output 
  Higher efficiency and output of human resources 
  Management of operation and maintenance costs 
  Centralized product management 
  Centralized  Customer  Relationship  Management 

(CRM) 

  Centralized accounting 
  Centralized monitoring 
  Centralized marketing management 

Propagation of electronic services based on core banking, 
results  in  high  Return  on  Investment  (ROI)  and  facilitates 
resource  planning,  because  buying  branches  for  banks  and 
attendance of customers in bank branches is expensive. 
 
3.  PROPOSED MODEL 
 

In  our  proposed  model,  relying  on  functionalities  and 
advantages  of  core  banking  and  SSO  systems,  and 
aggregating these systems, we combined their functionalities 
and  presented  an 
integrated  system  with  centralized 
management. Core banking system is used for integration of 
payment  methods  in  e-banking.  SSO  is  used  in  order  to 
integrate authentication process for this system. And cloud 
computing is used as a fundamental technology in order to 
reduce  system  development  costs  and  time.  Since  cloud 
computing provides services in infrastructure, platform and 
software  layers,  everywhere  cost  is  a  limitation  for  system 
development, we could profit its services.

Figure 3: Proposed Model 

 

 

In order to assure more security for banking system, private 
cloud deployment model is used to profit SSO-as-a-Service 
and Core Banking-as-a-Service. Of course access to the cloud 
is done via cloud agent that takes care of cloud security.

In SSO based system, user is identified by a unique identity 
and uses a unique gateway to facilitate payment services of all 
banks.  Certificate  Authority  (CA) 
issues  unique 
certificate or identity for every party or person, works under 
supervision  of  central  bank  but  can  use  different 
authentication  mechanisms.  But, 
to  satisfy 
non-repudiation  –  that  is  one  of  the  fundamental  security 
requirements  of  a  secure  internet  payment  system  [5]  – 
authentication mechanism should include digital signatures. 
The unique identity depending on authentication mechanism 
could be at forms of username and password pairs, signature 
cards [6], etc. 

in  order 

 
Structure  of  an  online  banking  system  is  commonly 
composed  of  five  elements:  user,  internet,  bank's  server, 
authentication,  and  transactions  [7].  In  another  view,  this 
system  is  composed  of  three  elements:  customer  network, 
internet,  and  bank  server  and  private  network  [4].  In  our 
model 
in  Figure  3,  after  successful

authentication and authorization, user signs in core banking 
system and requests for transactions. Depending on his/her 
certificate, these transactions could be performed or rejected. 
After searching  core banking transactions database, system 
performs  transactions  if  performable,  and  saves  them  in 
transactions database. Finally, these changes will be saved in 
banks' database. 

All  banks,  merchants,  service  providers,  and  third  party 
enterprises which need payment system, are connected to core 
banking system and recognize user's unique identity, and user 
has no need to be authenticated by every system again. 
 

Tracking and auditing of transactions require just searching 
for one identifier per identity in SSO database, and checking 
transactions related to this identity in centralized transactions 
database. Such an auditing is simpler and faster than existing 
systems. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
 

In this paper, a secure integrated model based on SSO and 
core banking system for providing e-banking services through 
cloud  computing  presented  that  speeds  up  and  simplifies 
transactions by centralizing and aggregating e-payment rules.

Furthermore,  using  cloud  computing  services,  this  model 
profits key advantage of this technology that is IT cost saving. 
 

Our  proposed  system  releases  users  from  memorizing 
different  combinations  of  usernames  and  passwords  and 
numbers  and  digits  and  letters,  for  different  banks  and 
payment  gateways  due  to  use  of  unique  identity.  Also 
simplifies management and auditing processes. 
 

It  is  worth  mentioning  that,  because  of  using  unique 
identity,  and  possibility  to  access  all  systems  using  this 
identity, its importance and tendency to theft it will be higher 
and require more effort to keep it secure and private.
