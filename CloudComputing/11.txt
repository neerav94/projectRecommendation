INTRODUCTION 

    The  Proposed  system  is  an  intra  college  communication  system  based  on  the  concept  of  web  services  and  cloud 
computing. We are using SAAS (Software as a Service) architecture which can be characterized as “Software deployed 
as  a  hosted  service  and  accessed  over  the  internet”.  In  this  system  the  communication  will  occur  between  staff’s  and 
students who use PC’s and mobile phones respectively. 

A.  Cloud Computing 

    Cloud  computing  moves  the  processing  efforts  from  the local  devices  to  data  centric  facilities  enabling  the  users  to 
create  and  edit  files  online.  It  differs  from  the  classic  client-server  model  as  it  provides  application  that  clients  can 
execute  and  manage  through  their  web  browser.  This  technology  allows  for  much  more  efficient  computing  by 
centralizing  data  storage,  processing and  bandwidth.  The  phrase  “software  as a  service”  (SAAS)  is  sometimes  used  to 
describe  application  programs  offered  through  cloud  computing.  Cloud  computing  provides  a  better  security  than  a 
scattered network and that is one of the reasons why clouds are working.

    One  of  the  most  common  methods  to  do  so  is  by  using  the  concept  of  web  services.  Web  Services  are  platform 
independent and language independent since they use standard XML languages. Moreover, majority of the web services 
use Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) for transmitting the messages.  
 

C. SHA (Secured hash algorithm) 

    Hash algorithms are used to provide information security services. A hash algorithm accepts a random block of data 
given by the user encodes it and returns a fixed-size bit string which is called the hash value, so if the user modifies the 
same block of data later then it will simultaneously change its hash value. The encoded data is called "Message" and their 
hash value is termed as "Message Digest". 

SHA1 Description 

    SHA1  is  a  hashing  algorithm  designed  by  the  United  States  National  Security  Agency  and  published  by  NIST 
(National Institute of Standards and Technology). It can have maximum message size of 264  - 1 bits however it accepts 
512 bit block size and outputs 160-bit message digest.

SHA1 Algorithm Description 
 

Pad the message with a single one followed by zeroes until the final block has 448 bits. 

 
  Append the size of the original message as an unsigned 64 bit integer. 
 

Initialize the 5 hash blocks (h0,h1,h2,h3,h4) to the specific constants defined in the SHA1 standard. 
 Allocate an 80 word array for the message schedule. 
 Set the first 16 words to be the 512bit 

 

 

                block split into 16 words.  

  The rest of the words are generated using the     following algorithm: 

 

  Word [i-3] XOR word [i-8] XOR word [i-14] XOR word [i-16] then rotated 1 bit to the left. 

 

  Loop 80 times doing the following.

    The  Proposed  system  is  an  intra  college  communication  system  based  on  the  concept  of  web  services  and  cloud 
computing. We are using SAAS (Software as a Service) architecture which can be characterized as “Software deployed

describe  application  programs  offered  through  cloud  computing.  Cloud  computing  provides  a  better  security  than  a 
scattered network and that is one of the reasons why clouds are working.

                  ■ b=a 

   ■ a = a (rotated left 5) + SHA function () + e + k + word[i] 

  Add a, b, c, d and e to the hash output. 
  Output the concatenation (h0, h1, h2, h3, h4) which is the message digest. 

 Password verification 

     A related application is password verification. Passwords are usually not n clear text, but instead in digest form, to 
improve  security.  To  authenticate  a  user,  the  password  presented  by  the  user  is  hashed  and  compared  with  the  stored 
hash. This also means that the original passwords cannot be retrieved if forgotten or lost, and they have to be replaced 
with new ones. The password is often concatenated with a random, non secret salt value that is stored with the password. 
Because users have different salts, it is not feasible to store tables of precomputed hash values for common passwords.

Traditional Computing Vs. Cloud Computing 

II. 

LITERATURE SURVEY 

     Cloud  computing  is  a  technology  which  is  similar  to  the  technology  in  traditional  networking.  However,  the  main 
difference between cloud computing and traditional computing is the execution and in one word that is “virtualization”. 
Virtualization allows for massive scalability, giving clients virtually unlimited resources. 

    In a traditional networking setup, the server is fixed in hardware and if  you  want to scale up to more users than the 
current  hardware  can  support,  you  would  have  to  spend  more  money  for  upgrades.  The  cloud  computing  uses 
virtualization  to  provide  only  the  resources  that  a  specific  user  needs  and  they  just  need  to  pay  for  the  use  while  in 
traditional networking they need to pay for hardware plus installations. 

   It is apparent that cloud computing gains the upper hand in this comparison especially when price is involved. Every 
move  with the  traditional network  setup  will  involve  some  form  of  installation like  laying  out  wires  and installing  the 
necessary software into each workstation. But with a cloud solution, all you need is a browser in each workstation and 
the work is ready to go as long as there is an internet connection.

III.  MODULES 

 

In  this  system  we  are  having  a  feature  of  intra messaging in  which  staffs  can  send  a  message  to  a  particular 
student only. 

  Students can even send messages to other students.

INTRODUCTION 

    The  Proposed  system  is  an  intra  college  communication  system  based  on  the  concept  of  web  services  and  cloud 
computing. We are using SAAS (Software as a Service) architecture which can be characterized as “Software deployed 
as  a  hosted  service  and  accessed  over  the  internet”.  In  this  system  the  communication  will  occur  between  staff’s  and 
students who use PC’s and mobile phones respectively. 

A.  Cloud Computing 

    Cloud  computing  moves  the  processing  efforts  from  the local  devices  to  data  centric  facilities  enabling  the  users  to 
create  and  edit  files  online.  It  differs  from  the  classic  client-server  model  as  it  provides  application  that  clients  can 
execute  and  manage  through  their  web  browser.  This  technology  allows  for  much  more  efficient  computing  by 
centralizing  data  storage,  processing and  bandwidth.  The  phrase  “software  as a  service”  (SAAS)  is  sometimes  used  to 
describe  application  programs  offered  through  cloud  computing.  Cloud  computing  provides  a  better  security  than  a 
scattered network and that is one of the reasons why clouds are working.

SAAS  is  one  of  the  methodologies  of  Cloud  Computing,  which  is  based  on  a  "one-to-many"  model  whereby  an 
application  is  shared  across  multiple  clients.  The  SAAS  model  can  add  efficiency  and  cost  savings  for  the  both  the 
vendor and customer. 

B.  Web Services 

    Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. 
One of the most interesting features of a web service is that they are self describing.  This means that once a web service 
is located we can ask it to describe itself and tell what operations it supports and how to invoke it, which is handled by 
the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). 

    Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages, typically 
conveyed  using  HTTP  with  an  XML  serialization  in  conjunction  with  other  Web-related  standards".  SOAP  (Simple 
Object  Access  Protocol)  specifies  the  format  in  which  the  requests  are  sent  to  the  server  and  how  the  server  should 
format the responses. There are two major classes of Web services, REST-compliant Web services, in which the primary 
purpose  of  the  service  is  to  manipulate  XML  representations  of  Web  resources  using  a  uniform  set  of  "stateless" 
operations and arbitrary Web services, in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations."

Neethuanna Mathew et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.3, March- 2014, pg. 1012-1017 

    One  of  the  most  common  methods  to  do  so  is  by  using  the  concept  of  web  services.  Web  Services  are  platform 
independent and language independent since they use standard XML languages. Moreover, majority of the web services 
use Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) for transmitting the messages.  
 

C. SHA (Secured hash algorithm) 

    Hash algorithms are used to provide information security services. A hash algorithm accepts a random block of data 
given by the user encodes it and returns a fixed-size bit string which is called the hash value, so if the user modifies the 
same block of data later then it will simultaneously change its hash value. The encoded data is called "Message" and their 
hash value is termed as "Message Digest". 

SHA1 Description 

    SHA1  is  a  hashing  algorithm  designed  by  the  United  States  National  Security  Agency  and  published  by  NIST 
(National Institute of Standards and Technology). It can have maximum message size of 264  - 1 bits however it accepts 
512 bit block size and outputs 160-bit message digest. 

Fig 1.3 Block Diagram Of SHA 

 

 
SHA1 Algorithm Description 
 

Pad the message with a single one followed by zeroes until the final block has 448 bits. 

 
  Append the size of the original message as an unsigned 64 bit integer. 
 

Initialize the 5 hash blocks (h0,h1,h2,h3,h4) to the specific constants defined in the SHA1 standard. 
 Allocate an 80 word array for the message schedule. 
 Set the first 16 words to be the 512bit 

 

 

                block split into 16 words.  

  The rest of the words are generated using the     following algorithm: 

 

  Word [i-3] XOR word [i-8] XOR word [i-14] XOR word [i-16] then rotated 1 bit to the left. 

 

  Loop 80 times doing the following.  

                    ■ Calculate SHA function() and the     constant K (these are based on the 
current round number. 
                  ■ e=d 
                  ■ d=c

                  ■ c=b (rotated left 30) 
                  ■ b=a 

   ■ a = a (rotated left 5) + SHA function () + e + k + word[i] 

  Add a, b, c, d and e to the hash output. 
  Output the concatenation (h0, h1, h2, h3, h4) which is the message digest. 

 Password verification 

     A related application is password verification. Passwords are usually not n clear text, but instead in digest form, to 
improve  security.  To  authenticate  a  user,  the  password  presented  by  the  user  is  hashed  and  compared  with  the  stored 
hash. This also means that the original passwords cannot be retrieved if forgotten or lost, and they have to be replaced 
with new ones. The password is often concatenated with a random, non secret salt value that is stored with the password. 
Because users have different salts, it is not feasible to store tables of precomputed hash values for common passwords.

Traditional Computing Vs. Cloud Computing 

II. 

LITERATURE SURVEY 

     Cloud  computing  is  a  technology  which  is  similar  to  the  technology  in  traditional  networking.  However,  the  main 
difference between cloud computing and traditional computing is the execution and in one word that is “virtualization”. 
Virtualization allows for massive scalability, giving clients virtually unlimited resources. 

    In a traditional networking setup, the server is fixed in hardware and if  you  want to scale up to more users than the 
current  hardware  can  support,  you  would  have  to  spend  more  money  for  upgrades.  The  cloud  computing  uses 
virtualization  to  provide  only  the  resources  that  a  specific  user  needs  and  they  just  need  to  pay  for  the  use  while  in 
traditional networking they need to pay for hardware plus installations. 

   It is apparent that cloud computing gains the upper hand in this comparison especially when price is involved. Every 
move  with the  traditional network  setup  will  involve  some  form  of  installation like  laying  out  wires  and installing  the 
necessary software into each workstation. But with a cloud solution, all you need is a browser in each workstation and 
the work is ready to go as long as there is an internet connection.

3) Assign task:  

  The HOD can assign the daily task to its department staff and manage it.  
  Similarly teachers can assign their project task and subject assignments to students. 

4) Group-wise broadcasting:  

  Notes and notifications can be broadcasted only to particular group.  
  For example: class teacher can send a notice only to its class students.  

 
5) Email:  

  Email service can be used by the staffs and students to mail and transfer information.  
  The service is used free of cost. 

 
6) Manage notifications:  

  Staff can send importance notice to all the students with the help of this notification feature.  

 

7) Monitor student group:  

  Staff can monitor the progress of their respective class or group.  
  This will help them to schedule their work and assign tasks.  

 
8) Staff-student communication:  

  Staff-Student  communication  is  the  main  feature  of  this  system  which  helps  in  increasing  the  bond  between 

student and teacher by sharing the information between different users. 

  This feature has maximum priority as communication is the base service of this system.  

 
9) Event creation  

 

Information regarding tech-fest in college or other cultural events can be circulated among the students.  

 
10) Easy Map 

 

In  this  Top  View  of  every  floor  will  be  shown  with  the  names  of  the  allotted  classrooms  which  would  help 
students to find out a particular class more easily. 

 
11) Request for group join/leave:  

  Any student or staff can join a particular group.  
  Staffs and students can even leave a particular group. 

 
 

IV. 

CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE 

    The system provides facilities of SMS, email, notifications, to-do-list, and various other features which give the user 
an  user  friendly  interactive  communication.  The  system  provides  high  security,  data  storage  and  authentication  using 
hash algorithms. Theft of information and misuse of user’s account is not possible. This creates a feeling of secured and 
safe communication in the users mind. Cloud based communication system can be implemented in various departments 
such as healthcare, corporate world, political and social world. It plays an important role in educational institutions by 
providing a platform for the students and staff for efficient and effective interaction it is cost effective as communication 
is done using wifi technology.
