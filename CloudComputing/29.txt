Abstract—This  study  presents  the  practical  approach  for 
designing  the  integrated  logistic  information  system  (ILIS)  in 
cloud  computing  environment.  It  is  intended  to  optimize 
resources  (vehicles,  human  resources,  oil,  etc.)  required  to 
logistics management. This system is targeted at the small and 
medium-sized third-party logistics (3PL) companies which are 
difficult  to  establish  IT  system  by  providing  a  remote  service 
environment like SaaS (Software as a Service). In this study, the 
concepts  traveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  and  Dynamic 
Programming (DP) are used for route optimization. We intend 
to  contribute  to  minimize  the  operational  cost  of  the  logistics 
system by designing remote service.

logistics 

The 

information 

system  has 
contributed  to  reduce  logistics  cost  and  to  enhance  the 
efficiency  of  the  logistics  business,  after  the  adoption  of 
logistics company in the early 2000s. But the significant parts 
of the system components are relying on expensive logistics 
solutions.  In  addition,  the  logistic  companies  wish  to 
integrate  the  load  optimization  solution  with  the  route 
optimization solution within a single system. Therefore, the 
integrated logistics information system (ILIS) is necessary to 
the  logistics  company.  But  most  of  third-party  logistics 
companies  are  small  and  medium-sized  scale,  so  they  are 
hard to establish and operate IT system in the respect to the 
cost.  In  this  study,  we  suggest  the  design  of  the  main 
components of ILIS in the shape of SaaS in cloud computing 
environment. 
 

II.   CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

Logistics business is made up of many tasks until complete 
delivery after receiving order of the customer. Fig. 1 shows 
the  overall  logistics  business  process.  After  receiving 
customer's  order,  a  logistics  company  plans  the  delivery 
schedules  with  consideration  for  delivery  destinations  and 
appointment time. In the case of long-distance transportation 
such  as between  the central distribution  centers  (CDC)  and 
the regional distribution centers (RDC), the load optimization 
is important because the number of operational vehicles can

III.  MATERIAL AND METHOD 

A.  Cloud Computing 

Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of 
configurable  computing  resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers, 
storage,  applications,  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or 
service  provider  interaction  [1].  Gartner  defines  cloud 
computing as "a style of computing where massively scalable 
IT-enabled capabilities are delivered 'as a service' to external 
customers  using  Internet 
technologies"  [2].  Essential 
Characteristics  of  cloud  computing  are  on-demand 
self-service,  broad  network  access,  resource  pooling,  rapid 
elasticity and measured service [1], [3]. The cloud computing 
service  is  classified  to  public  cloud,  private  cloud,  hybrid 
cloud and community cloud according to deployment target 

[1]. And it is classified to SaaS, PaaS and IaaS according to 
service  model.  Table  I  describes  three  service  models  and 
four deployment models. In this study, we propose design of 
the ILIS as a shape of SaaS in hybrid Cloud environment. In 
this study, we propose design of the ILIS as a shape of SaaS 
in hybrid Cloud environment. And we suggest development 
and  deployment  environment  of  the  ILIS  to  use  PaaS.  The 
choice of PaaS should be preceded before designing system 
because  every  vendor  has  some  technical  constraints  and 
vendor  dependency.  To  choose  PaaS  for  the  ILIS,  we 
analyzed  the  features  of  PaaS  of  two  vendors.  Table  II 
describes  comparison  of  the  most  famed  PaaS.  Microsoft 
Windows Azure is more powerful than Google App Engine 
in terms of database and function and pricing and supported 
language. But App Engine provides more useful free services. 
Development and deploy environment is also importance in 
terms of development productivity and efficient operation of 
system.  So  we  need  to  test  sample  function  at  each 
environment.

platform, integration, business process management and database services) 

(e.g., Microsoft Windows Azure, Google App Engine, Force.com (SalesForce), OrangeScape, Wolf PaaS) 

Infrastructure as a Service : IaaS delivers computer infrastructure (including servers, software, data-center space

(e.g., Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Google Cloud Storage) 

Private cloud 

A private cloud is a particular model of cloud computing that involves a distinct and secure cloud based 
environment in which only the specified client can operate.  

(e.g., Windows Azure) 

Community cloud 

The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations 
that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations) [1]. 

Deployment 
Models 

Public cloud 

A public cloud is the standard cloud computing model, in which a service provider makes resources, such as 
applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet. 

(e.g., Amazon Web Services , IBM SmartCloud, Oracle Cloud, Google App Engine, Windows Azure)  

Hybrid cloud 

The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or 
public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables 
data and application portability [1]. 

 

B.  Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) 

The  traveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  to  find  the 
minimum  cost  path  passing  through  all  the  given  n  cities 
exactly  once  [4]–[8].  It  is  one  of  the  most  widely  studied 
combinatorial optimization problems [5]. It is a well-known 
NP-hard problem [4]. The exact algorithms for solving TSP, 
such as integer linear programming (ILP), branch-and-bound 
(BB) algorithm and dynamic programming (DP) have been 
proven [5]. These methods could not be practically used due 
to their exponential time complexity in the worst case [4]. 

Therefore,  one  stream  of  research  has  consisted  of 
developing heuristic algorithms with a guaranteed worst-case 
performance  [5].  The  heuristic  algorithms  to  finding  near 
optimal solution for the TSP are genetic algorithm (GA) [9], 
ant  colony  optimization  (ACO)  [10],  simulated  annealing 

(SA) [11], tabu search (TS) [12], neural network (NN) [13]. 
But they did not guarantee to find the optimal solution. 

The  multiple  traveling  salesman  problem  (MTSP)  is  a 
generalization of the TSP, where more than one salesman is 
allowed  to  be  used  in  the  solution  [14].  MTSP  extends  the 
problem  to  a  wide  variety  of  vehicle  routing  problems 
(VRPs)  by  incorporating  some  additional  side  constraints 
such  as  vehicle  capacity  limits,  delivery  time  windows,  as 
well as time dependent speeds in metropolitan area [14].

[15]. In this approach we solve small instances first, store the 
results,  and  later,  whenever  we  need  a  result,  look  it  up 
instead  of  recomputing  it  [4].  In  dynamic  programming 
algorithms, we construct a solution from the bottom up in an 
array  (or  sequence  of  arrays)  [4].  Because  the  principle  of 
optimality  applies  in  a  Shortest  Paths  problem,  we  can 
develop a recursive property that gives an optimal solution to 
an instance in terms of optimal solutions to subinstances [4].

The matrix D is the distance matrix. It contains the lengths 
of the shortest paths in the graph [4]. We accomplish this by 
creating a sequence of n+1 arrays D(k), where 0 ≤ k ≤ n and 
where D(k)[i][j] is the length  of a shortest  path  from  vi  to  vj 
using  only  vertices  in  the  set  {v1,  v2,…  ,vk}  as  intermediate 
vertices [4]. We can determine D(k) from D(k-1) as follows [4]: 

 
 

The array P is the optimal path matrix [4]. When at least 
one intermediate vertex exists, P[i][j] is the  highest index of 
an intermediate vertex on the shortest path from vi to vj [4]. If 
no intermediate vertex exists, it is zero [4]. The graph in Fig.

The graph in Fig. 3 is represented by adjacency matrix like 

below [4]. 

 
 

Using  the  above  dynamic  programming,  we  can  get  the 
optimal solution, which the minimum distance is 14 and the 
shortest paths are {1-2-3-4-5-1}. 

In the case of a straightforward enumerative of paths, the 
time  complexity  is  is  O(n!)  [4].  In  the  case  of  dynamic 
programming, the time complexity can be reduced to O(n22n) 
[4]. The memory complexity is O(n2n) [4], [16]. Although the 
complexity  was  reduced,  this  method  is  feasible  when  n  is 
small [4]. 

In  logistics  area,  the  vertices  can  be  represented  to 
destinations  for  delivery  and  the  edge  is  distance  between 
each destination. Because we supposed the load already was 
assigned to the vehicle, the number of vertices are not large. 
Moreover our system is going to be run in cloud computing 
environment,  we  can  get  more  efficient  performance  than 
single local computing environment. 

 

IV.  SYSTEM DESIGN 

We designed the architecture of the ILIS based on cloud 
computing shown as Fig. 4. Infrastructure layer is a physical 
layer  which  is  running  ILIS.  Application  layer  is  the 
environment which services are developed and deployed and 
testing.  This  layer  has  vendor  dependency.  Therefore  we 
need  detailed  investigation  about  technology  constraint 
according  to  the  vendor  of  PaaS.  Service  Layer  consists  of 
our  services  for  logistics  business.  We  designed  service 
components based on service oriented architecture (SOA).  

Master 

component 

data  management 

performs 
management  about  base  data  for  running  ILIS  such  as 
customer, product, vehicle, driver, destination, zone, and so 
on. Order management component consists of functions that 
receive,  modify  and  complete  order  from  customer. 
Transportation management component consists of functions 
such  as  delivery  scheduling,  the  route  optimization  and  the 
load optimization. 

These components are shape of remote service. Therefore 
these  are  independent  and  interoperable  between  each 
component.

Abstract—This  study  presents  the  practical  approach  for 
designing  the  integrated  logistic  information  system  (ILIS)  in 
cloud  computing  environment.  It  is  intended  to  optimize 
resources  (vehicles,  human  resources,  oil,  etc.)  required  to 
logistics management. This system is targeted at the small and 
medium-sized third-party logistics (3PL) companies which are 
difficult  to  establish  IT  system  by  providing  a  remote  service 
environment like SaaS (Software as a Service). In this study, the 
concepts  traveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  and  Dynamic 
Programming (DP) are used for route optimization. We intend 
to  contribute  to  minimize  the  operational  cost  of  the  logistics 
system by designing remote service.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

integrated 

logistics 

The 

information 

system  has 
contributed  to  reduce  logistics  cost  and  to  enhance  the 
efficiency  of  the  logistics  business,  after  the  adoption  of 
logistics company in the early 2000s. But the significant parts 
of the system components are relying on expensive logistics 
solutions.  In  addition,  the  logistic  companies  wish  to 
integrate  the  load  optimization  solution  with  the  route 
optimization solution within a single system. Therefore, the 
integrated logistics information system (ILIS) is necessary to 
the  logistics  company.  But  most  of  third-party  logistics 
companies  are  small  and  medium-sized  scale,  so  they  are 
hard to establish and operate IT system in the respect to the 
cost.  In  this  study,  we  suggest  the  design  of  the  main 
components of ILIS in the shape of SaaS in cloud computing 
environment. 
 

II.   CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

Logistics business is made up of many tasks until complete 
delivery after receiving order of the customer. Fig. 1 shows 
the  overall  logistics  business  process.  After  receiving 
customer's  order,  a  logistics  company  plans  the  delivery 
schedules  with  consideration  for  delivery  destinations  and 
appointment time. In the case of long-distance transportation 
such  as between  the central distribution  centers  (CDC)  and 
the regional distribution centers (RDC), the load optimization 
is important because the number of operational vehicles can

through  accurate 

it  more  efficient 

be significantly reduced. In the case of regional delivery, the 
route  optimization  is  required  because  it  has  multiple 
delivery points from RDC. Warehouse management system 
makes 
inventory 
management  and  scheduling.  The  freight  charges  between 
shippers and logistic companies should be computed and the 
path of the vehicle by GPS (Global Positioning System) also 
should  be  monitored.  By  monitoring  vehicle  movement, 
route breakaway can be prevented and a sudden accident can 
be taken action quickly. In order to forecast freight volume 
and  to  reflect  in  the  delivery  schedule,  the  analysis  of 
completed delivery data is also necessary.

Fig. 2. Overview of the ILIS. 

 

Describing in terms of system, the stakeholders of the ILIS 
are  shippers,  logistics  companies,  warehouse  managers  and 
vehicle drivers.  The main function of the system consists of 
master data management, order management, transportation 
management, warehouse management, freight management, 
vehicle  monitoring,  analysis  reports,  mobile  business 
management,  and  system  management.  The  core  functions 
are  considered  to  delivery  scheduling,  dispatching,  load 
optimization  for  transportations  between  CDCs  and  RDCs, 
route  optimization  for  delivery  to  customers.  Fig.  2  is 
overview of the ILIS. This shows interaction between main 
functions  of  the  system.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  ILIS  is 
essential  to  the  logistics  business  because  real  time  data

processing between stakeholders is important. 

 

III.  MATERIAL AND METHOD 

A.  Cloud Computing 

Cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of 
configurable  computing  resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers, 
storage,  applications,  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or 
service  provider  interaction  [1].  Gartner  defines  cloud 
computing as "a style of computing where massively scalable 
IT-enabled capabilities are delivered 'as a service' to external 
customers  using  Internet 
technologies"  [2].  Essential 
Characteristics  of  cloud  computing  are  on-demand 
self-service,  broad  network  access,  resource  pooling,  rapid 
elasticity and measured service [1], [3]. The cloud computing 
service  is  classified  to  public  cloud,  private  cloud,  hybrid 
cloud and community cloud according to deployment target 

[1]. And it is classified to SaaS, PaaS and IaaS according to 
service  model.  Table  I  describes  three  service  models  and 
four deployment models. In this study, we propose design of 
the ILIS as a shape of SaaS in hybrid Cloud environment. In 
this study, we propose design of the ILIS as a shape of SaaS 
in hybrid Cloud environment. And we suggest development 
and  deployment  environment  of  the  ILIS  to  use  PaaS.  The 
choice of PaaS should be preceded before designing system 
because  every  vendor  has  some  technical  constraints  and 
vendor  dependency.  To  choose  PaaS  for  the  ILIS,  we 
analyzed  the  features  of  PaaS  of  two  vendors.  Table  II 
describes  comparison  of  the  most  famed  PaaS.  Microsoft 
Windows Azure is more powerful than Google App Engine 
in terms of database and function and pricing and supported 
language. But App Engine provides more useful free services. 
Development and deploy environment is also importance in 
terms of development productivity and efficient operation of 
system.  So  we  need  to  test  sample  function  at  each 
environment.

SaaS 

PaaS 

IaaS 

Software as a Service : SaaS provides application software as a shape of online service. 

(e.g., SalesForce CRM, Google Apps, DeskAway, Impel CRM, Wipro w-SaaS) 

Platform as a Service : PaaS is a broad collection of application infrastructure services (including application 
platform, integration, business process management and database services) 

(e.g., Microsoft Windows Azure, Google App Engine, Force.com (SalesForce), OrangeScape, Wolf PaaS) 

Infrastructure as a Service : IaaS delivers computer infrastructure (including servers, software, data-center space 
and network equipment) as a service. 

(e.g., Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Google Cloud Storage) 

Private cloud 

A private cloud is a particular model of cloud computing that involves a distinct and secure cloud based 
environment in which only the specified client can operate.  

(e.g., Windows Azure) 

Community cloud 

The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations 
that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations) [1]. 

Deployment 
Models 

Public cloud 

A public cloud is the standard cloud computing model, in which a service provider makes resources, such as 
applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet. 

(e.g., Amazon Web Services , IBM SmartCloud, Oracle Cloud, Google App Engine, Windows Azure)  

Hybrid cloud 

The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or 
public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables 
data and application portability [1]. 

 

B.  Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) 

The  traveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  to  find  the 
minimum  cost  path  passing  through  all  the  given  n  cities 
exactly  once  [4]–[8].  It  is  one  of  the  most  widely  studied 
combinatorial optimization problems [5]. It is a well-known 
NP-hard problem [4]. The exact algorithms for solving TSP, 
such as integer linear programming (ILP), branch-and-bound 
(BB) algorithm and dynamic programming (DP) have been 
proven [5]. These methods could not be practically used due 
to their exponential time complexity in the worst case [4]. 

Therefore,  one  stream  of  research  has  consisted  of 
developing heuristic algorithms with a guaranteed worst-case 
performance  [5].  The  heuristic  algorithms  to  finding  near 
optimal solution for the TSP are genetic algorithm (GA) [9], 
ant  colony  optimization  (ACO)  [10],  simulated  annealing 

(SA) [11], tabu search (TS) [12], neural network (NN) [13]. 
But they did not guarantee to find the optimal solution. 

The  multiple  traveling  salesman  problem  (MTSP)  is  a 
generalization of the TSP, where more than one salesman is 
allowed  to  be  used  in  the  solution  [14].  MTSP  extends  the 
problem  to  a  wide  variety  of  vehicle  routing  problems 
(VRPs)  by  incorporating  some  additional  side  constraints 
such  as  vehicle  capacity  limits,  delivery  time  windows,  as 
well as time dependent speeds in metropolitan area [14]. 

In this study, supposing single driver and the load already 
the  vehicle,  we  adopted  dynamic

programming to solve TSP for route optimization.

C.  Dynamic Programming (DP) 

Dynamic  programming  is  a  technique  for  efficiently 
implementing a recursive algorithm by storing partial results

[15]. In this approach we solve small instances first, store the 
results,  and  later,  whenever  we  need  a  result,  look  it  up 
instead  of  recomputing  it  [4].  In  dynamic  programming 
algorithms, we construct a solution from the bottom up in an 
array  (or  sequence  of  arrays)  [4].  Because  the  principle  of 
optimality  applies  in  a  Shortest  Paths  problem,  we  can 
develop a recursive property that gives an optimal solution to 
an instance in terms of optimal solutions to subinstances [4].

Auto Scaling 

The matrix D is the distance matrix. It contains the lengths 
of the shortest paths in the graph [4]. We accomplish this by 
creating a sequence of n+1 arrays D(k), where 0 ≤ k ≤ n and 
where D(k)[i][j] is the length  of a shortest  path  from  vi  to  vj 
using  only  vertices  in  the  set  {v1,  v2,…  ,vk}  as  intermediate 
vertices [4]. We can determine D(k) from D(k-1) as follows [4]: 

 
 

The array P is the optimal path matrix [4]. When at least 
one intermediate vertex exists, P[i][j] is the  highest index of 
an intermediate vertex on the shortest path from vi to vj [4]. If 
no intermediate vertex exists, it is zero [4]. The graph in Fig. 
3 is represented by the optimal path matrix like below [4].

Fig.  3  shows  a  weighted,  directed  graph.  The  circles 
represent  vertices,  and  a  line  from  one  circle  to  another

edges have values associated with them, the values are called 
weights [4].

We represent a weighted graph containing n vertices by an 

array W where 

 
 
The graph in Fig. 3 is represented by adjacency matrix like 

below [4]. 

 
 

Using  the  above  dynamic  programming,  we  can  get  the 
optimal solution, which the minimum distance is 14 and the 
shortest paths are {1-2-3-4-5-1}. 

In the case of a straightforward enumerative of paths, the 
time  complexity  is  is  O(n!)  [4].  In  the  case  of  dynamic 
programming, the time complexity can be reduced to O(n22n) 
[4]. The memory complexity is O(n2n) [4], [16]. Although the 
complexity  was  reduced,  this  method  is  feasible  when  n  is 
small [4]. 

In  logistics  area,  the  vertices  can  be  represented  to 
destinations  for  delivery  and  the  edge  is  distance  between 
each destination. Because we supposed the load already was 
assigned to the vehicle, the number of vertices are not large. 
Moreover our system is going to be run in cloud computing 
environment,  we  can  get  more  efficient  performance  than 
single local computing environment. 

 

IV.  SYSTEM DESIGN 

We designed the architecture of the ILIS based on cloud 
computing shown as Fig. 4. Infrastructure layer is a physical 
layer  which  is  running  ILIS.  Application  layer  is  the 
environment which services are developed and deployed and 
testing.  This  layer  has  vendor  dependency.  Therefore  we 
need  detailed  investigation  about  technology  constraint 
according  to  the  vendor  of  PaaS.  Service  Layer  consists  of 
our  services  for  logistics  business.  We  designed  service 
components based on service oriented architecture (SOA).

V.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
 

 

The ILIS based on cloud computing designed in this study 
can  contribute  to  the  optimization  of  logistics  operations 
through  offer  to  the  small  and  medium  sized  logistic 
company  by  an  economical  cost.  The  function  of  the  load 
optimization  can  reduce  a  number  of  operation  vehicles 
through maximize vehicle capacity. The function of the route 
optimization  can  reduce  the  driving  distances  through 
suggestion about shortest paths before starting delivery. If the 
core functions are serviced by mobile web, logistics work can 
be more efficiently performed by real time. The systems of 
solving optimization problem which need to large amount of 
hardware  resources  such  as  CPU  and  memory  can  be  run 
more efficiently in cloud computing environment.  

Our future works are consideration about security and data 
collision  because  this  system  is  sharing  by  many  logistics 
company.  And  after  developing  the  route  optimization,  we 
are going to do quantitative measurement about performance 
in cloud computing environment.
