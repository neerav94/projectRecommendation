become  more  complicated  when  the  attackers  use  spoofed  IP 
addresses  as  source  to  send  the  packets,  which  make  it 
difficult  to  identify  the  origins  of  attacks.  The  DoS  or  DDoS 
attack  can  cause  significant  business  loss  because  of  less 
productivity and services, increase downtime; therefore loss in 
reputation.  There  are  two  main  reasons  that  make  DoS  or 
DDoS  attack  very  popular  among  different  groups  of  users. 
Firstly, there are many tools available to conduct DDoS attack 
on victim. Most of these tools can be used by attacker without 
having great deal of technical expertise. Availability  of worm 
maker and ignorance of large number of Internet users make it 
convenient for attacker to place “bot” into different computers, 
what  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack.  Secondly,  victim 
organisation  will  have  to  spend  time  and  resources  to  locate 
attacker,  which  needs  significant  involvement  of  IT  security 
experts2.  Many  organisations  are not ready  to  spend  adequate 
amount  of  resources  to  investigate  the  source  of  the  attack, 
which  encourages  the  attacker  to  conduct  an  attack.  Because 
of  the  high  risk  of  losing  company  reputation,  number  of 
companies tries not to disclose any security incident in public, 
which also motivates attacker to use this technique.

consume  the  bandwidth,  processing  power  or  memory  of 
victim network / server; therefore will cause denial of service 
to  legitimate  users3.  Spam  emails,  data  with  errors,  large 
volume of data or simple “GET” request for website can cause 
DDoS  attack.  Logic  DoS  attack  will  be  based  on  exploitation 
of  vulnerabilities  within  victim  system  or  network.  This  type 
of  attack  needs  expertise  or  intelligent  application  to  identify 
or to  exploit  the  vulnerabilities  of  certain networked  service3. 
Example  of  logic  attack  can  be  the  situation  where  attacker 
injects  fake  routing 
information  to  prevent  or  redirect 
legitimate traffic  from reaching victim’s system by  exploiting 
the missing authentication requirements. Sending traffic to the 
victim  system  by  using  fragmented  IP  datagram  can  cause 
system  failure,  therefore  DoS;  if  the  victim  computer’s 
operating system or other application software is not securely 
configured.  DDoS  bandwidth  attack  can  take  place  by  using 
TCP SYN flood, ICMP or UDP flood; which will overload the 
allocated  bandwidth  of  service  provider  so  that  legitimate 
customers  will not  be  able to access  their  services  because  of 
overloaded  network.  Smurf  attacks,  Ping  of  Death  attack, 
TearDrop or Land attack are some common ways to attacking 
cloud  computing  environment,  which  will  consume  the 
resources  of  victim’s network  and  server4.   Payload  in  ICMP 
or  DNS  reply  also  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack,  which  will 
have  high  probability  to  pass  through  the  Firewalls.  Public 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been used as tool for DoS attack 
in recent years by many different attackers. 

IP  Spoofing  is  a  very  popular  technique  used  with  DoS 
attack,  where  the  IP  been  forged  as  the  traffic  coming  from 
victim’s network. Alternatively, fake IP can be used as source 
of  the  data  packet,  which  does  not  exist.  Upon  receiving  the 
data  packet,  victim  system  will  try  to  communicate  with  the 
forged  source  system  that  does  not  exist.  This  whole  process 
will  consume  large  amount  of  resources  to  cause  successful 
DoS.  However,  spoofing  the  IP  address  of  source  is  not 
mandatory  for  DoS  or  DDoS  attack.  Attacker  may  also  use 
number  of  compromised  hosts  or  chain  of  proxies  to  make 
“trace  back”  operation  difficult  to  justify  the  authenticity  of 
source  of  the  packet.  Countries  with  weak  or  no  information 
security  legislation  can  play  significant  role  to  attackers 
success, if they take the opportunity of this weakness. 

R.K.  Chang5  has  divided  flooding  DDoS  attack  into  two 
main  categories  names  as:  direct  attack  and  reflector  attack. 
He  has  explained  direct  attack  as  attackers  have  spoofed  the 
source  IP address and  send  the  traffic  and  payload  directly  to 
the  victim  computer  or  network.  This  type  of  attack  takes 
place  by  using  ICMP  Echo  flooding  technique,  where  victim 
system  will  have  to  handle  large  amount  of  ICMP  Echo 
request. UDP data flooding is another popular technique used 
in  direct  DDoS  attack  to  connect  chargen-  and  echo-  ports 
between  two  victims.  TCP  SYN  flooding  attacks  use  large 
number  of  data  packets  with  forged  IP  address  as  source 
address in packet header so that victim system tries to connect 
to  the  source  and  because  of  non-exists  source  address,  there 
will be many “half-open” connection to consume the resources 
of victim network. Fragmented IP flooding technique also can 
be used to consume the resources, specifically the memory  of 
the victim server7. 

Unlike this direct  attack, reflector attack takes place when 
the attacker forges the data packet header’s IP address. Victim 
computer’s  IP  will  be  used  as  “source  address”  to  send  the 
data payload to a third party by the attacker. On receiving this 
data packet, third party system will reply to the victim system 
as  that  is  given  as  source  address  in  packet  header  (Fig  1). 
This  type  of  attack  is  complicated  to  response  to  protect  the 
organisation  while  this  technique  can  be  used  to  bring  more 
than one system down at the same time. Many different types 
of networking protocols can be used for reflector DDoS attack, 
which  can  include  any  application  layer  protocols  to  request 
data from web server or DNS server. 

 

Fig 1: DDoS with Spoofing 

 

 

This  type  of  attack  also  can  use  packet  amplification 
techniques,  where  third  party  will  reply  against  a  particular 
request  with  several packets  of  data.  An  example  of  this type 
of attack can be, when an ICMP request goes to the broadcast 
address  of  a  network,  therefore  each host  of  that network  get 
the  ICMP request.  As  a result  of  this request,  individual host 
will  reply  to  the  source  address  to  cause  DDoS,  which  has 
been  forged  by  using  victim’s  IP  address.  This  attack  use 
single  ICMP  Echo  to  amplify  into  many  ICMP  Echo  Reply 
packets6. 

Flooding  attack,  both  direct  and  reflector  attack  can  be 
used  against  a  router  to  slow  down  the  network  or  to  cause 
denial  of  service,  which  is  critical  for  organisation’s  network 
to  serve  their  legitimate  users.  Using  this  DDoS  attack 
technique  against  DNS  is  a  common  threats,  which  cause 
significant  disruption  to  the  organisation’s  business.  Simple 
tools can be used to perform flooding DDoS attack. This may 
not  requires  high  volume  of  resources  or  bandwidth,  which 
made  this  type  of  attack  very  popular  among  different 
attackers.  If  the  flooding  attacks  take  place  in  a  form  of 
distributed  attack,  attacker  must  have  to  have  DDoS  agents 
into different systems, which had been compromised before. 

types  data  packets 

In  contrast  to  the  nature  of  flooding  attack,  logic  attack 
will  use  different 
the 
vulnerabilities of victim system. This attack will take place in 
a  form  of  direct  attack,  as  the  attacker  will  already  know  the 
vulnerabilities of the targeted system.  Some common methods 
used  in  DDoS  logic  attack  include  exploitation  of  syntax  or 
semantic  error  in  victim  system.  Bugs  in  the  system  can  be 
used as vulnerability to attack by attacker (Fig 2).

or  DNS  reply  also  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack,  which  will 
have  high  probability  to  pass  through  the  Firewalls.  Public 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been used as tool for DoS attack 
in recent years by many different attackers. 

IP  Spoofing  is  a  very  popular  technique  used  with  DoS 
attack,  where  the  IP  been  forged  as  the  traffic  coming  from 
victim’s network. Alternatively, fake IP can be used as source 
of  the  data  packet,  which  does  not  exist.  Upon  receiving  the 
data  packet,  victim  system  will  try  to  communicate  with  the 
forged  source  system  that  does  not  exist.  This  whole  process 
will  consume  large  amount  of  resources  to  cause  successful 
DoS.  However,  spoofing  the  IP  address  of  source  is  not 
mandatory  for  DoS  or  DDoS  attack.  Attacker  may  also  use 
number  of  compromised  hosts  or  chain  of  proxies  to  make 
“trace  back”  operation  difficult  to  justify  the  authenticity  of 
source  of  the  packet.  Countries  with  weak  or  no  information 
security  legislation  can  play  significant  role  to  attackers 
success, if they take the opportunity of this weakness. 

R.K.  Chang5  has  divided  flooding  DDoS  attack  into  two 
main  categories  names  as:  direct  attack  and  reflector  attack. 
He  has  explained  direct  attack  as  attackers  have  spoofed  the 
source  IP address and  send  the  traffic  and  payload  directly  to 
the  victim  computer  or  network.  This  type  of  attack  takes 
place  by  using  ICMP  Echo  flooding  technique,  where  victim 
system  will  have  to  handle  large  amount  of  ICMP  Echo 
request. UDP data flooding is another popular technique used 
in  direct  DDoS  attack  to  connect  chargen-  and  echo-  ports 
between  two  victims.  TCP  SYN  flooding  attacks  use  large 
number  of  data  packets  with  forged  IP  address  as  source 
address in packet header so that victim system tries to connect 
to  the  source  and  because  of  non-exists  source  address,  there 
will be many “half-open” connection to consume the resources 
of victim network. Fragmented IP flooding technique also can 
be used to consume the resources, specifically the memory  of 
the victim server7. 

Unlike this direct  attack, reflector attack takes place when 
the attacker forges the data packet header’s IP address. Victim 
computer’s  IP  will  be  used  as  “source  address”  to  send  the 
data payload to a third party by the attacker. On receiving this 
data packet, third party system will reply to the victim system 
as  that  is  given  as  source  address  in  packet  header  (Fig  1). 
This  type  of  attack  is  complicated  to  response  to  protect  the 
organisation  while  this  technique  can  be  used  to  bring  more 
than one system down at the same time. Many different types 
of networking protocols can be used for reflector DDoS attack, 
which  can  include  any  application  layer  protocols  to  request 
data from web server or DNS server. 

 

Fig 1: DDoS with Spoofing 

 

 

This  type  of  attack  also  can  use  packet  amplification 
techniques,  where  third  party  will  reply  against  a  particular 
request  with  several packets  of  data.  An  example  of  this type 
of attack can be, when an ICMP request goes to the broadcast 
address  of  a  network,  therefore  each host  of  that network  get 
the  ICMP request.  As  a result  of  this request,  individual host 
will  reply  to  the  source  address  to  cause  DDoS,  which  has 
been  forged  by  using  victim’s  IP  address.  This  attack  use 
single  ICMP  Echo  to  amplify  into  many  ICMP  Echo  Reply 
packets6. 

Flooding  attack,  both  direct  and  reflector  attack  can  be 
used  against  a  router  to  slow  down  the  network  or  to  cause 
denial  of  service,  which  is  critical  for  organisation’s  network 
to  serve  their  legitimate  users.  Using  this  DDoS  attack 
technique  against  DNS  is  a  common  threats,  which  cause 
significant  disruption  to  the  organisation’s  business.  Simple 
tools can be used to perform flooding DDoS attack. This may 
not  requires  high  volume  of  resources  or  bandwidth,  which 
made  this  type  of  attack  very  popular  among  different 
attackers.  If  the  flooding  attacks  take  place  in  a  form  of 
distributed  attack,  attacker  must  have  to  have  DDoS  agents 
into different systems, which had been compromised before.

In  contrast  to  the  nature  of  flooding  attack,  logic  attack 
will  use  different 
the 
vulnerabilities of victim system. This attack will take place in 
a  form  of  direct  attack,  as  the  attacker  will  already  know  the 
vulnerabilities of the targeted system.  Some common methods 
used  in  DDoS  logic  attack  include  exploitation  of  syntax  or 
semantic  error  in  victim  system.  Bugs  in  the  system  can  be

In  next  section  of  this  paper,  we  will  be  investigating  on 

different mechanisms to detect DoS or DDoS attack. 

III.  MECHANISM TO DETECT DOS ATTACK 

Different  types  of  techniques  and  technologies  have  been 
used  to  identify  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  or  DDoS  attach. 
Incoming traffic can be analysed mainly in two different ways. 
Manual or automated anomaly detection system can be used to 
identify  DoS  attack,  where  trend  of  network  use  can  be  set 
against  the  real  network  use;  therefore  any  deviation  from 
expected  traffic  into  the  network  can  be  identified  as  sign  of 
DoS or DDoS attack and can be looked into the further details. 
However, it is a challenge to decide the expected behaviour of 
the  network  or  users8.  This  type  of  detection  mechanism  can 
detect  new  or  modified  attacks 
including  zero  days’ 
vulnerabilities. Traffic analysis mechanism to identify DoS  or 
DDoS  attack  also  can  work  based  on  signature.  Signature 
based  mechanism  works  in  similar  principal  like  antivirus, 
where  the  attacks  will  only  be  identified  if  the  attack  type 
already  given  into  the  detection  system.  Signature  based  DoS 
attack  identification  mechanism  is  hugely  vulnerable  to  zero 
days  attack.  Attackers  also  may  change  or  modify  the attacks 
type or tools just to avoid the detection system. 

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are widely been used to 
identify  DoS  attack,  which  normally  has  three  different 
sections to perform different tasks. Part of IDS will be able to 
use  different  sensors  to  collect  data  from  network  or  host 
machine,  which  will  then  be  analysed  to  identify  abnormal 
activities  and  the  last  function  of  traditional  IDS  will  be  to 
generate alert for administrator as well as logging the incident 
for  future  use.  There  are  two  main  categories  of  IDS  been 
used;  Network  based  Intrusion  Detection  System  (NIDS)  and 
Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). NIDS will be 
able  to  collect  the  data  from  whole network  while  HIDS  will 
be  used  to  collect  the  data  only  from  specific  host.  Having 
both  of  these  systems  in  place  can  provide  efficiency  in  data 
collection, therefore effective analysis and generating alerts in 
case  of  any  intrusion  attack.  Intrusion  Detection  Systems  are 
necessary  part  of  network  now  to  ensure  timely  detection  of 
any  attacks  including  DoS  or  DDoS.  Log  from  IDS  is  very 
important to prosecute the attacker. This log also can be used 
to analyse the attacking method for future attack prevention. 

In  next  section  of  this  paper,  we  will  be  investigating  on 

different mechanisms to prevent DoS or DDoS attack. 

network.  In  this  section,  we  will  be  explaining  different 
mechanisms  to  protect  the  organisation’s  IT  systems  against 
DoS  attack.  We  also  will  propose  a  cost  effective  potential 
solution to prevent DDoS attack. 

Operating  Systems  and  different  applications  can  raise 
massive  security  concerns  in  terms  of  being  victim  of  DoS 
attack,  while  individual  software  within  a  networked  system 
not  has  been  configured  efficiently  to  ensure  the  optimum 
security. Unnecessary ports and services can be enabled into a 
system, which can be used by the attacking tools or attackers. 
Having  updated  signature  database  for  antivirus  and  security 
patches  of  OS  can  contribute  significantly 
in  defence 
mechanism  of  DoS  attack.  It is  important  to  ensure that  each 
device  within  the  network  does  have  strong  authentication 
system so that logic attack cannot take place by modifying the 
configuration  of  router  or  such  other  devices.  IDS  should  be 
used  with  effective  customisation  according  to  the  needs  of 
network  environment.  Both  NIDS  and  HIDS  can  be  used  to 
minimise  the  false  positive  and  false  negative  alerts  and  to 
detect attacks on early stage. Firewall or similar device should 
be used for access control to the network. Many resources may 
needs  to  be  used  within  the  network  but  not  from  Internet; 
therefore  access  list  should  be  implemented  according  to  the 
security  policy10.  A  support  for  Quality-of-Service  (QoS) 
features should be configured in router. 

If  an  intrusion  has  been  identified  while  in  deployment 
phase of the attack,  there should be an automated mechanism 
of  killing  process,  restarting  application  and  killing  active 
connections by using TCP RST in case of TCP SYN attack11. 
Propagation  of  worm  typically  based  on  stack  smashing 
attack,  where  attacker  managed  to  access  compromised  host 
systems12.  In  terms  of  propagating  worms,  a  compromised 
host will establish connection with many different hosts within 
short period of time; therefore limiting the rate of connections 
for  certain  time  will  be  an  effective  defence  mechanism 
against  this  type  of  attack13.  Vulnerability  scanner  plays 
important 
the 
networked  system.  Software  auditing  including  checking  the 
vulnerabilities  for  buffer  overflow  attack,  SQL  injection  or 
XSS  attack  should  be  conducted  regularly  to  prevent  these 
types of attacks.

PROPOSED PREVENTIVE MECHANISM AGAINST DDOS 

IV.  MECHANISM TO PREVENT DOS AND DDOS ATTACK 

ATTACK: 

There is no single solution against DoS or DDoS attack as 
the  attacker  can  use  many  different  methods  of  attack. 
Organisation  will  have 
to  adopt  different  protective 
mechanisms  to  have  efficient  defence  against  DoS  attack.  A 
defence  in  depth  approach  will  help  to  fight  against  DoS, 
where  there  will  be  different  layers  of  protection  by  using 
different security strategies and technologies. To prevent DoS 
attack,  there  needs  to  be  minimum  two  layers  of  protective 
mechanism.  First  layer  will react  on  deployment  phase  of  the 
attack,  when the  attacker might try  to  spread  a  worm  or  start 
the TCP SYN flood to the network.  Second layer of defence 
mechanism  will  react  on  time  of  active  attack  to  prevent  the 

One  of  the  complicacy  to  have  effective  defence  against 
DDoS is identify the attacked traffic separately than legitimate 
traffics. Attackers normally use many spoofed IP addresses to 
attack the  system, therefore  it  become  resource  consuming to 
check  each  of  the  data  packets.  Edge  routers  can  be  used  to 
mark  the  source  of  data  packet  by  using  reverse  checking 
mechanism. In case of DDoS attack, large volume of data will 
be coming from certain hosts. If the source IP has been forged, 
the type  of data will be identical for most of the cases.  Using 
TTL or hop counts, data packets can be grouped as trusted or 
untrusted.  To  perform 
this  operation,  “hardware  based 
watermarking  technology”  can  be  used.  This  section  of  the

Abstract—Cloud computing has been considered as one of the 
crucial  and  emerging  networking  technology,  which  has  been 
changed the  architecture  of  computing in last few  years.  Despite 
the  security concerns  of protecting  data  or providing  continuous 
service  over  cloud,  many  organisations  are  considering  different 
types  cloud  services  as  potential  solution  for  their  business.  We 
are researching on cloud computing security issues and potential 
cost  effective  solution  for  cloud  service  providers.  In  our  first 
paper  we  have  revealed  number  of  security  risks  for  cloud 
computing environment, which has focused on lack of awareness 
of  cloud  service  providers.  In  our  second  paper,  we  have 
investigated on technical security issues involved in cloud service 
environment, where it’s been revealed that DoS or DDoS is one of 
the  common  and  significant  dangers  for  cloud  computing

INTRODUCTION 

Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  attack  and  Distributed  Denial  of 
Service Attack (DDoS) are two common types  of attacks that 
do  not  have  a  single  solution  to  protect  the  organisation’s  IT 
assets. DoS or DDoS can have severe impact on business and 
reputation; therefore organisation needs to ensure the security 
of  their  IT  resources  to  protect  from  DDoS  attack.  By  using 
DoS  or  DDoS  techniques,  attacker  tries  to  flood  the  network 
or  overload  the  server  with  traffic  so  that  the  legitimate  users 
cannot  use  the  services.  Trends  to  use  DoS  or  DDoS  attack 
have  been  increased  in  recent  years.  These  techniques  have 
been  used  for  “cyber  warfare”  as  well.  DDoS  attack  on  Visa 
MasterCard  and  PayPal  by  “anonymous” 
to 
WikiLeaks,  DDoS  attack  on  Sony  PlayStation,  “LulzSec” 
DDoS  attack  on  CIA  and  U.K.  Serious  Organised  Crime 
Agency (SOCA), DDoS attack on WordPress, attack on Hong 
King  Stoke  Exchange,  CyberBunker  DDoS  attack  are  some 
news, which shows the destructive power of DDoS attack1.

Successful attacks on these large companies also prove that 
how  vulnerable  small  organisations  are  as  long  as  DoS  and 
DDoS  are  concerned.  DDoS  attacker  may  use  thousands  of 
different IP addresses to send different types of data packets to 
the  targeted  server  or  network.  The  process  become  very 
complicated  for  the  victim  server  or  network  to  differentiate

between  the  legitimate  traffic  and  “fake”  traffic.  Situations 
become  more  complicated  when  the  attackers  use  spoofed  IP 
addresses  as  source  to  send  the  packets,  which  make  it 
difficult  to  identify  the  origins  of  attacks.  The  DoS  or  DDoS 
attack  can  cause  significant  business  loss  because  of  less 
productivity and services, increase downtime; therefore loss in 
reputation.  There  are  two  main  reasons  that  make  DoS  or 
DDoS  attack  very  popular  among  different  groups  of  users. 
Firstly, there are many tools available to conduct DDoS attack 
on victim. Most of these tools can be used by attacker without 
having great deal of technical expertise. Availability  of worm 
maker and ignorance of large number of Internet users make it 
convenient for attacker to place “bot” into different computers, 
what  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack.  Secondly,  victim 
organisation  will  have  to  spend  time  and  resources  to  locate 
attacker,  which  needs  significant  involvement  of  IT  security 
experts2.  Many  organisations  are not ready  to  spend  adequate 
amount  of  resources  to  investigate  the  source  of  the  attack, 
which  encourages  the  attacker  to  conduct  an  attack.  Because 
of  the  high  risk  of  losing  company  reputation,  number  of 
companies tries not to disclose any security incident in public, 
which also motivates attacker to use this technique. 

In next section we will investigate on different techniques, 
which  can  be  used  in  DoS  or  DDoS  attack.  After  discussing 
about different DDoS attack, we will propose a framework for 
cloud  computing  environment  that  can  use  hardware  based 
watermarking technology to detect and prevent DoS or DDoS 
attack. 

II. 

TECHNIQUES OF DOS / DDOS ATTACK: 

Aim  of  Denial  of  Service  attack  is  to  consume  the 
resources  of  victim  computer’s  processing  power  or  victim’s 
network  bandwidth  so  that  the  victim  network  would  not  be 
able to serve legitimate users. This attack generally takes place 
in very distributed ways, which will make the victim network 
vulnerable within short period of time. Most of the cases, it is 
difficult  to  detect  the  DoS  or  DDoS  attack  early  enough  to 
adopt  appropriate  counter  measures  to  protect  the  resources 
because  of  the  distinctive  nature  and  source  of  this  attack. 
Different  types  of  worms  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack.  This 
type of attack also can take place in a form of flooding or logic 
attack.  In  flooding  attack,  large  amount  of  “real”  but 
unnecessary  data  will  be  send  to  the  victim  network  or  the 
victim  network  will  receive  high  volume  of  request  from 
different sources for specific services. Result of this attack will

consume  the  bandwidth,  processing  power  or  memory  of 
victim network / server; therefore will cause denial of service 
to  legitimate  users3.  Spam  emails,  data  with  errors,  large 
volume of data or simple “GET” request for website can cause 
DDoS  attack.  Logic  DoS  attack  will  be  based  on  exploitation 
of  vulnerabilities  within  victim  system  or  network.  This  type 
of  attack  needs  expertise  or  intelligent  application  to  identify 
or to  exploit  the  vulnerabilities  of  certain networked  service3. 
Example  of  logic  attack  can  be  the  situation  where  attacker 
injects  fake  routing 
information  to  prevent  or  redirect 
legitimate traffic  from reaching victim’s system by  exploiting 
the missing authentication requirements. Sending traffic to the 
victim  system  by  using  fragmented  IP  datagram  can  cause 
system  failure,  therefore  DoS;  if  the  victim  computer’s 
operating system or other application software is not securely 
configured.  DDoS  bandwidth  attack  can  take  place  by  using 
TCP SYN flood, ICMP or UDP flood; which will overload the 
allocated  bandwidth  of  service  provider  so  that  legitimate 
customers  will not  be  able to access  their  services  because  of 
overloaded  network.  Smurf  attacks,  Ping  of  Death  attack, 
TearDrop or Land attack are some common ways to attacking 
cloud  computing  environment,  which  will  consume  the 
resources  of  victim’s network  and  server4.   Payload  in  ICMP 
or  DNS  reply  also  can  be  used  for  DDoS  attack,  which  will 
have  high  probability  to  pass  through  the  Firewalls.  Public 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been used as tool for DoS attack 
in recent years by many different attackers. 

IP  Spoofing  is  a  very  popular  technique  used  with  DoS 
attack,  where  the  IP  been  forged  as  the  traffic  coming  from 
victim’s network. Alternatively, fake IP can be used as source 
of  the  data  packet,  which  does  not  exist.  Upon  receiving  the 
data  packet,  victim  system  will  try  to  communicate  with  the 
forged  source  system  that  does  not  exist.  This  whole  process 
will  consume  large  amount  of  resources  to  cause  successful 
DoS.  However,  spoofing  the  IP  address  of  source  is  not 
mandatory  for  DoS  or  DDoS  attack.  Attacker  may  also  use 
number  of  compromised  hosts  or  chain  of  proxies  to  make 
“trace  back”  operation  difficult  to  justify  the  authenticity  of 
source  of  the  packet.  Countries  with  weak  or  no  information 
security  legislation  can  play  significant  role  to  attackers 
success, if they take the opportunity of this weakness. 

R.K.  Chang5  has  divided  flooding  DDoS  attack  into  two 
main  categories  names  as:  direct  attack  and  reflector  attack. 
He  has  explained  direct  attack  as  attackers  have  spoofed  the

of victim network. Fragmented IP flooding technique also can

DDoS  attack  also  can  work  based  on  signature.  Signature 
based  mechanism  works  in  similar  principal  like  antivirus, 
where  the  attacks  will  only  be  identified  if  the  attack  type 
already  given  into  the  detection  system.  Signature  based  DoS 
attack  identification  mechanism  is  hugely  vulnerable  to  zero 
days  attack.  Attackers  also  may  change  or  modify  the attacks 
type or tools just to avoid the detection system. 

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are widely been used to 
identify  DoS  attack,  which  normally  has  three  different 
sections to perform different tasks. Part of IDS will be able to 
use  different  sensors  to  collect  data  from  network  or  host 
machine,  which  will  then  be  analysed  to  identify  abnormal 
activities  and  the  last  function  of  traditional  IDS  will  be  to 
generate alert for administrator as well as logging the incident 
for  future  use.  There  are  two  main  categories  of  IDS  been 
used;  Network  based  Intrusion  Detection  System  (NIDS)  and 
Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). NIDS will be 
able  to  collect  the  data  from  whole network  while  HIDS  will 
be  used  to  collect  the  data  only  from  specific  host.  Having 
both  of  these  systems  in  place  can  provide  efficiency  in  data 
collection, therefore effective analysis and generating alerts in 
case  of  any  intrusion  attack.  Intrusion  Detection  Systems  are 
necessary  part  of  network  now  to  ensure  timely  detection  of 
any  attacks  including  DoS  or  DDoS.  Log  from  IDS  is  very 
important to prosecute the attacker. This log also can be used 
to analyse the attacking method for future attack prevention. 

In  next  section  of  this  paper,  we  will  be  investigating  on 

different mechanisms to prevent DoS or DDoS attack. 

network.  In  this  section,  we  will  be  explaining  different 
mechanisms  to  protect  the  organisation’s  IT  systems  against 
DoS  attack.  We  also  will  propose  a  cost  effective  potential 
solution to prevent DDoS attack. 

Operating  Systems  and  different  applications  can  raise 
massive  security  concerns  in  terms  of  being  victim  of  DoS 
attack,  while  individual  software  within  a  networked  system 
not  has  been  configured  efficiently  to  ensure  the  optimum 
security. Unnecessary ports and services can be enabled into a 
system, which can be used by the attacking tools or attackers. 
Having  updated  signature  database  for  antivirus  and  security 
patches  of  OS  can  contribute  significantly 
in  defence 
mechanism  of  DoS  attack.  It is  important  to  ensure that  each 
device  within  the  network  does  have  strong  authentication 
system so that logic attack cannot take place by modifying the 
configuration  of  router  or  such  other  devices.  IDS  should  be 
used  with  effective  customisation  according  to  the  needs  of 
network  environment.  Both  NIDS  and  HIDS  can  be  used  to 
minimise  the  false  positive  and  false  negative  alerts  and  to 
detect attacks on early stage. Firewall or similar device should 
be used for access control to the network. Many resources may 
needs  to  be  used  within  the  network  but  not  from  Internet; 
therefore  access  list  should  be  implemented  according  to  the 
security  policy10.  A  support  for  Quality-of-Service  (QoS) 
features should be configured in router. 

If  an  intrusion  has  been  identified  while  in  deployment 
phase of the attack,  there should be an automated mechanism 
of  killing  process,  restarting  application  and  killing  active 
connections by using TCP RST in case of TCP SYN attack11. 
Propagation  of  worm  typically  based  on  stack  smashing 
attack,  where  attacker  managed  to  access  compromised  host 
systems12.  In  terms  of  propagating  worms,  a  compromised 
host will establish connection with many different hosts within 
short period of time; therefore limiting the rate of connections 
for  certain  time  will  be  an  effective  defence  mechanism 
against  this  type  of  attack13.  Vulnerability  scanner  plays 
important 
the 
networked  system.  Software  auditing  including  checking  the 
vulnerabilities  for  buffer  overflow  attack,  SQL  injection  or 
XSS  attack  should  be  conducted  regularly  to  prevent  these 
types of attacks.

PROPOSED PREVENTIVE MECHANISM AGAINST DDOS 

IV.  MECHANISM TO PREVENT DOS AND DDOS ATTACK 

ATTACK: 

There is no single solution against DoS or DDoS attack as 
the  attacker  can  use  many  different  methods  of  attack. 
Organisation  will  have 
to  adopt  different  protective 
mechanisms  to  have  efficient  defence  against  DoS  attack.  A 
defence  in  depth  approach  will  help  to  fight  against  DoS, 
where  there  will  be  different  layers  of  protection  by  using 
different security strategies and technologies. To prevent DoS 
attack,  there  needs  to  be  minimum  two  layers  of  protective 
mechanism.  First  layer  will react  on  deployment  phase  of  the 
attack,  when the  attacker might try  to  spread  a  worm  or  start 
the TCP SYN flood to the network.  Second layer of defence 
mechanism  will  react  on  time  of  active  attack  to  prevent  the 

One  of  the  complicacy  to  have  effective  defence  against 
DDoS is identify the attacked traffic separately than legitimate 
traffics. Attackers normally use many spoofed IP addresses to 
attack the  system, therefore  it  become  resource  consuming to 
check  each  of  the  data  packets.  Edge  routers  can  be  used  to 
mark  the  source  of  data  packet  by  using  reverse  checking 
mechanism. In case of DDoS attack, large volume of data will 
be coming from certain hosts. If the source IP has been forged, 
the type  of data will be identical for most of the cases.  Using 
TTL or hop counts, data packets can be grouped as trusted or 
untrusted.  To  perform 
this  operation,  “hardware  based 
watermarking  technology”  can  be  used.  This  section  of  the

network will use traceback mechanism by using hop count and 
TTL to test the authenticity of source of data, anomaly of the 
type  of  data  and  classify  the  source/data  as  trusted  or 
untrusted.  Hardware  watermarking  also  will  maintain a table, 
which can use certain cache timing, so that traffic from certain 
host is not blocked permanently. After certain time, hardware 
watermarking  will  check  the  incoming  data  packets  from 
specific host again as that might be a legitimate host machine, 
which  had  been  compromised  because  of  attackers  worm.   
Updated table of trusted and untrusted hosts should be passed 
to  the  next  device  of  the  network  such  as  router  to  send  the 
traffic  to  the  right  destination.  This  device  should  have 
defence  mechanism  to  protect  itself  from  DDoS  attack 
especially  for  TCP  SYN  attack.  Specific  TTL  should  be 
assigned 
the  source  of 
information.  Having  hardware  watermarking  and  filtering 
technology  can  work  as  efficient  and  cost  effective  defence 
mechanism against DDoS attack  for any organisation because 
of less consumption of resources. 

traceback  operation 

to  verify 

Proposed  hardware-based  watermarking  technology  to 
detect  and  prevent  DoS  attack  will  work  on  following 
principles: 

1)  Once packet will reach to the network,  source of the 

packet will be identified. 

2)  Traceback  mechanism  should  be  used  to  check  the 

authenticity of source address by using Hop Counts and TTL. 

3) 

If  the  source  cannot  be  verified,  packet  will  be 
marked as untrusted and will be dropped without sending it to 
internal network. 

4)  Each packet coming from same untrusted source will 

be grouped together based on source authenticity (Figure 3) 

VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH:  

This  paper  is  very  beginning  of  the  research  to  design  a 
cost  effective  solution  for  cloud  computing  environment  to 
prevent  DoS  attack.  In  this  early  stage  of  this  research,  we 
tried  to  identify  the  nature  and  severity  of  DoS  attack  and 
different techniques used by this attack, so that we can design 
and build the prototype. 

Hardware  based  watermarking  and  filtering  mechanism 
can  provide  additional  layer  of  defence  against  DDoS  attack, 
which also will consume less resources. We will continue this 
research  to  present  an  algorithm,  build  and  test  prototype  for 
Hardware based watermarking and filtering method to prevent 
the network from DDoS attack.

should be sending to Firewall or IPS for in depth investigation 
to reduce the rate of false positive or false negative response.
