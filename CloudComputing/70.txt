A.  Types of Service Models in Cloud 
 
   The cloud computing service models [2] are discussed below as: 
    
   1) Software as a Service (SaaS):  Under this layer, applications are delivered through the medium of the Internet as a service. 
Instead of  installing and  maintaining  software,  you simply access it  via the Internet, freeing  yourself from complex software 
and hardware management. 
  
  2) Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): To understand this cloud computing layer one needs to remember the  traditional computing 
model where each application  managed locally required hardware, an operating system, a database, middleware, Web  servers, 
and other software. One also needs to remember the team of network, database, and system management experts that are needed 
to keep everything up and running. With cloud computing, these services are now provided remotely by cloud providers under 
this layer. 
  
   3) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Products offered via this  mode  include the remote delivery (through the Internet) of a 
full computer infrastructure (e.g., virtual computers, servers, storage devices, etc.). 
 
B.  Deployment Models in Cloud computing 
 
 The four types of cloud [3] available in cloud computing are following: 
  
   1) Private cloud: The cloud infrastructure is operated for a private organization. It may be managed by the organization or a 
third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   2) Community cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  shared  by  several organizations and supports a specific community that 
has communal concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the 
organizations or a third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   3) Public cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  made  available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by 
an organization selling cloud services. 
 
   4) Hybrid cloud: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain 
unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary  technology, that enables data and application portability 
(e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds). 
 
   There are various issues in Cloud that is preventing organizations from using Cloud. One of these issues is security. 
 
   Security: While leading Cloud services providers employ data storage and transmission encryption, user authentication, and 
authorization (data access) practices, many people worry about  the vulnerability of data to criminals like hackers, thieves, and 
disgruntled  employees.  Cloud  providers  are  enormously  sensitive  to  this  issue  and  apply  substantial  resources  to  mitigating 
concern [4].There are many issues that are faced by cloud computing security.  
 
   The major issues faced by Cloud Computing Security are discussed below: 
 
   1)  Insecure application programming interfaces: Cloud providers supply some kind of software interfaces for the customers, 
weak and user friendly interfaces exposes security issues [5]. 
    
   2)  Account, service and traffic hijacking: Stolen credentials used for this kind of attacks on the clouds which are usually taken 
by phishing, fraud or Denial of Services (DoS) [5]. 
 
   3)  Malicious Insider: A malicious insider is a person motivated to create a bad impact on the organization’s mission by taking 
action that compromises information confidentiality, integrity, and/or  availability. The  malicious activities of  an insider could 
potentially have an impact on: the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all kind of data and services with impact on the 
internal activities, organization’s reputation and customer trust. This is especially important in the case of cloud computing due 
to  the  fact  that  cloud  architectures  require  certain  roles,  like  cloud  administrators,  cloud  auditors,  cloud  security  personnel, 
which are extremely high-risk. Cloud’s economies of scale and flexibility are both a friend and a  foe from a security point of 
view. The management of security risk involves users, the technology itself, the cloud service providers, and the legal aspects of

the data and services being used. The massive concentrations of resources and data present a more attractive target to attackers, 
but cloud-based defenses can be more robust, scalable and cost-effective than traditional ones. To help reduce the threat, cloud 
computing stakeholders should invest in implementing security measures to ensure that the data is being kept secure and private 
throughout its lifecycle [6].

difficult to restore. Unauthorized access into cloud can leads to data theft and losses [5]. 
 
   Since cloud computing technology provides user the facility to store their data in the datacenters of cloud, security of data is 
an important concern. This  paper  proposed  a  scheme  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security of data stored on the cloud. The  
 proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two  methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in

that  makes  it  different  from  existing  data  storage  schemes  is  that  integrity  is  ensured  by  client.  This  property  may  help  in 
gaining trust of clients. 
 

II.   LITERATURE REVIEW 

   The Cloud computing [5] concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic 
benefits are the main driver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational expenditure. In 
order for this to become reality, however, there are still some challenges to be solved. Most important among these are security 
and trust issues, since the user’s data has to be released to the Cloud and thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner. In 
contrast  to  traditional  solutions,  where  the  IT  services  are  under  proper  physical,  logical  and  personnel  controls,  Cloud 
Computing  moves  the  application  software  and  databases  to  the  large  data  centers,  where  the  management  of  the  data  and 
services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been 
well  understood.  Security  is  to  save  data  from  danger  and  vulnerability.  There  are  so  many  dangers  and  vulnerabilities  to  be 
handled. Various security issues and some of their solution are explained in this paper. This paper concentrates mainly on public 
cloud security issues and their solutions.  Data  should always be encrypted  when stored  (using separate  symmetric encryption 
keys)  and  transmitted.  If  this  is  implemented  appropriately,  even  if  another  tenant  can  access  the  data,  all  that  will  appear  is 
gibberish. So a method is proposed such that the whole data is encrypted along with the cryptographic key. 
   In [7] author has given a brief introduction on Cloud computing and touched some of the security issues related  to a cloud. 
Having explained the problems in the cloud, author has also proposed some solutions to the same with the help of algorithms 
like the DES and RAS Algorithms. 
   Cloud computing [8] in today’s world is making wide differences between it and other technologies. The critical data of users 
can be stolen by various means whereas cloud computing is still not a secure way to store users data. This paper tries provides a 
review  of  what  are  various  types  of  digital  watermarking  techniques  and  in  what  way  the  integrity  of  watermarking  can  be 
attacked so as throttle the system. The collaboration of digital watermarking when used for cloud computing can significantly 
result to make the system robust as well as secure user’s data. 
   Cloud  computing  [9]  is  the  way  of  providing  computing  resources  in  the  form  of  service  rather  than  a  product,  utilities  are 
provided to the users over internet. The main goal of cloud computing concept is to secure, protect the data and the processes 
which  come  under  the  property  of  users.  The  security  of  cloud  computing  environment  is  an  exclusive  research  area  which 
requires further development from both the academic and research communities. In cloud environment the computing resources 
are under the control of service provider, the third party auditor ensures the data integrity over out sourced data. In this paper 
digital  signature  method is proposed to protect the privacy and integrity of outsourced data in cloud environment. This paper 
used RSA algorithm for digital signature and for the process of encryption and decryption. 
   Increasing  demand  for  cloud  applications  [10]  has  led  to  an  ever  growing  need  for  security  mechanisms.  The  most  serious 
concerns are the possibility of lack of confidentiality, integrity and authentication among the cloud users and service providers. 
The key intent of this research work is to investigate the existing security schemes and to ensure data confidentiality, integrity 
and authentication.  In this paper symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are adopted for the optimization of data 
security in cloud computing. 
   In  [11]  the  problem  of  ensuring  the  integrity  of  data  storage  in  Cloud  Computing    is  studied.  In  particular,  they  have 
considered the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic 
data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his 
data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The 
support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion,  is 
also  a  significant  step  toward  practicality,  since  services  in  Cloud  Computing  are  not  limited  to  archive  or  backup  data  only. 
While  prior  works  on  ensuring  remote  data  integrity  often  lacks  the  support  of  either  public  auditability  or  dynamic  data 
operations,  this  paper  achieves  both.  The  authors  first  identify  the  difficulties  and  potential  security  problems  of  direct 
extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for

Instead of  installing and  maintaining  software,  you simply access it  via the Internet, freeing  yourself from complex software 
and hardware management. 
  
  2) Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): To understand this cloud computing layer one needs to remember the  traditional computing 
model where each application  managed locally required hardware, an operating system, a database, middleware, Web  servers, 
and other software. One also needs to remember the team of network, database, and system management experts that are needed 
to keep everything up and running. With cloud computing, these services are now provided remotely by cloud providers under 
this layer. 
  
   3) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Products offered via this  mode  include the remote delivery (through the Internet) of a 
full computer infrastructure (e.g., virtual computers, servers, storage devices, etc.). 
 
B.  Deployment Models in Cloud computing 
 
 The four types of cloud [3] available in cloud computing are following: 
  
   1) Private cloud: The cloud infrastructure is operated for a private organization. It may be managed by the organization or a 
third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   2) Community cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  shared  by  several organizations and supports a specific community that 
has communal concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the 
organizations or a third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   3) Public cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  made  available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by 
an organization selling cloud services. 
 
   4) Hybrid cloud: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain 
unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary  technology, that enables data and application portability 
(e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds). 
 
   There are various issues in Cloud that is preventing organizations from using Cloud. One of these issues is security. 
 
   Security: While leading Cloud services providers employ data storage and transmission encryption, user authentication, and 
authorization (data access) practices, many people worry about  the vulnerability of data to criminals like hackers, thieves, and 
disgruntled  employees.  Cloud  providers  are  enormously  sensitive  to  this  issue  and  apply  substantial  resources  to  mitigating 
concern [4].There are many issues that are faced by cloud computing security.  
 
   The major issues faced by Cloud Computing Security are discussed below: 
 
   1)  Insecure application programming interfaces: Cloud providers supply some kind of software interfaces for the customers, 
weak and user friendly interfaces exposes security issues [5]. 
    
   2)  Account, service and traffic hijacking: Stolen credentials used for this kind of attacks on the clouds which are usually taken 
by phishing, fraud or Denial of Services (DoS) [5]. 
 
   3)  Malicious Insider: A malicious insider is a person motivated to create a bad impact on the organization’s mission by taking 
action that compromises information confidentiality, integrity, and/or  availability. The  malicious activities of  an insider could 
potentially have an impact on: the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all kind of data and services with impact on the 
internal activities, organization’s reputation and customer trust. This is especially important in the case of cloud computing due 
to  the  fact  that  cloud  architectures  require  certain  roles,  like  cloud  administrators,  cloud  auditors,  cloud  security  personnel, 
which are extremely high-risk. Cloud’s economies of scale and flexibility are both a friend and a  foe from a security point of 
view. The management of security risk involves users, the technology itself, the cloud service providers, and the legal aspects of

the data and services being used. The massive concentrations of resources and data present a more attractive target to attackers, 
but cloud-based defenses can be more robust, scalable and cost-effective than traditional ones. To help reduce the threat, cloud 
computing stakeholders should invest in implementing security measures to ensure that the data is being kept secure and private 
throughout its lifecycle [6]. 
 
   4)    Data  loss/leakage:  Deletion  or  alteration  of  records  without  proper  backups  and  loss  of  encoding  key  make  the  cloud 
difficult to restore. Unauthorized access into cloud can leads to data theft and losses [5]. 
 
   Since cloud computing technology provides user the facility to store their data in the datacenters of cloud, security of data is 
an important concern. This  paper  proposed  a  scheme  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security of data stored on the cloud. The  
 proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two  methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in 
maintaining confidentiality and integrity of data and Fingerprinting helps in recovery of data. The property of proposed  scheme 
that  makes  it  different  from  existing  data  storage  schemes  is  that  integrity  is  ensured  by  client.  This  property  may  help  in 
gaining trust of clients. 
 

II.   LITERATURE REVIEW 

   The Cloud computing [5] concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic 
benefits are the main driver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational expenditure. In 
order for this to become reality, however, there are still some challenges to be solved. Most important among these are security 
and trust issues, since the user’s data has to be released to the Cloud and thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner. In 
contrast  to  traditional  solutions,  where  the  IT  services  are  under  proper  physical,  logical  and  personnel  controls,  Cloud 
Computing  moves  the  application  software  and  databases  to  the  large  data  centers,  where  the  management  of  the  data  and 
services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been 
well  understood.  Security  is  to  save  data  from  danger  and  vulnerability.  There  are  so  many  dangers  and  vulnerabilities  to  be 
handled. Various security issues and some of their solution are explained in this paper. This paper concentrates mainly on public 
cloud security issues and their solutions.  Data  should always be encrypted  when stored  (using separate  symmetric encryption 
keys)  and  transmitted.  If  this  is  implemented  appropriately,  even  if  another  tenant  can  access  the  data,  all  that  will  appear  is 
gibberish. So a method is proposed such that the whole data is encrypted along with the cryptographic key. 
   In [7] author has given a brief introduction on Cloud computing and touched some of the security issues related  to a cloud. 
Having explained the problems in the cloud, author has also proposed some solutions to the same with the help of algorithms 
like the DES and RAS Algorithms. 
   Cloud computing [8] in today’s world is making wide differences between it and other technologies. The critical data of users 
can be stolen by various means whereas cloud computing is still not a secure way to store users data. This paper tries provides a 
review  of  what  are  various  types  of  digital  watermarking  techniques  and  in  what  way  the  integrity  of  watermarking  can  be 
attacked so as throttle the system. The collaboration of digital watermarking when used for cloud computing can significantly 
result to make the system robust as well as secure user’s data. 
   Cloud  computing  [9]  is  the  way  of  providing  computing  resources  in  the  form  of  service  rather  than  a  product,  utilities  are 
provided to the users over internet. The main goal of cloud computing concept is to secure, protect the data and the processes 
which  come  under  the  property  of  users.  The  security  of  cloud  computing  environment  is  an  exclusive  research  area  which 
requires further development from both the academic and research communities. In cloud environment the computing resources 
are under the control of service provider, the third party auditor ensures the data integrity over out sourced data. In this paper 
digital  signature  method is proposed to protect the privacy and integrity of outsourced data in cloud environment. This paper 
used RSA algorithm for digital signature and for the process of encryption and decryption. 
   Increasing  demand  for  cloud  applications  [10]  has  led  to  an  ever  growing  need  for  security  mechanisms.  The  most  serious 
concerns are the possibility of lack of confidentiality, integrity and authentication among the cloud users and service providers. 
The key intent of this research work is to investigate the existing security schemes and to ensure data confidentiality, integrity 
and authentication.  In this paper symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are adopted for the optimization of data 
security in cloud computing. 
   In  [11]  the  problem  of  ensuring  the  integrity  of  data  storage  in  Cloud  Computing    is  studied.  In  particular,  they  have 
considered the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic 
data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his 
data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The 
support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion,  is 
also  a  significant  step  toward  practicality,  since  services  in  Cloud  Computing  are  not  limited  to  archive  or  backup  data  only. 
While  prior  works  on  ensuring  remote  data  integrity  often  lacks  the  support  of  either  public  auditability  or  dynamic  data 
operations,  this  paper  achieves  both.  The  authors  first  identify  the  difficulties  and  potential  security  problems  of  direct 
extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for

the seamless integration of these two salient features in their protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, 
they  improve  the  existing  proof  of  storage  models  by  manipulating  the  classic  Merkle  Hash  Tree  construction  for  block  tag 
authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, they further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate 
signature  to  extend  the  main  result  into  a  multiuser  setting,  where  TPA  can  perform  multiple  auditing  tasks  simultaneously. 
Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure. 
   With  the  advent  of  the  World  Wide  Web  [12]  and  the  emergence  of  e-commerce  applications  and  social  networks, 
organizations  across  the  world  generate  a  large  amount  of  data  daily.  This  data  would  be  more  useful  to  cooperating 
organizations if they were able to share their data. Two major obstacles to this process of data sharing are providing a common 
storage  space  and  secure  access  to  the  shared  data.  In  this  paper  these  issues  are  addressed  by  combining  cloud  computing 
technologies  such  as  Hive  and  Hadoop  with  XACML  policy  based  security  mechanisms  that  provide  fine-grained  access  to 
resources. This paper further presents a web-based application that uses this combination and allows collaborating organizations 
to securely store and retrieve large amounts of data. 
   A  k-out-of-n  recursive  information  hiding  scheme  based  on  an  n-ary  tree  data  structure  is  described  in  [13].  In  recursive 
hiding  of  information,  the  user  encodes  additional  information  in  the  shares  of  the  secret  intended  to  be  originally  shared, 
without  an  expansion  in  the  size  of  the  latter.  The  proposed  scheme  has  applications  in  secure  distributed  storage  and 
information dispersal protocols. It may be used as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information, which may be used 
for authentication and verification of shares and the reconstructed secret itself. 
   The scheme proposed in [3] is introducing a Trusted Third Party, tasked with assuring specific security characteristics within a 
cloud environment. The proposed solution calls upon cryptography, specifically Public Key  Infrastructure operating in concert 
with  SSO  and  LDAP,  to  ensure  the  authentication,  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  involved  data  and  communications.  The 
solution, presents a  horizontal level of  service, available to  all implicated entities, that realizes a  security  mesh,  within  which 
essential trust is maintained. 
   A  recursive  computational  multi  secret  sharing  technique  is  presented  in  [14]  that  hides  k  -  2  secrets  of  size  b  each  into  n 
shares  of  a  single  secret  S  of  size  b,  such  that  any  k  of  the  n  shares  suffice  to  recreate  the  secret  S  as  well  as  all  the  hidden 
secrets. This may act as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information or used for authentication and verification  of 
shares and the secret itself. Further, such a recursive technique may be used as a computational secret sharing technique that has 
potential  applications  in  secure  and  reliable  storage  of  information  on  the  Web,  in  sensor  networks  and  information  dispersal 
schemes. The presented technique, unlike previous computational techniques, does not require the use of any encryption key or 
storage of public information. 
 
                                                                              III.   PRESENT WORK 
   The security of data stored on the severs of cloud is an important issue in cloud computing technology. In the present work a 
scheme  is  proposed  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security  of  data  stored  on  the  cloud.  The  proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two 
methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in  maintaining  confidentiality  and  integrity  of 
data and Fingerprinting helps in recovery of data. Since the fingerprints have zero collision property, only the original user can 
access or  modify the data. This property  may help  in gaining trust of clients. The property of proposed  scheme that  makes it 
different from existing data storage schemes is that integrity is ensured by client. The steps followed in the proposed scheme are 
as follows: 

 
 

 

 

In the first step, File is taken from the client.  
In  second  step,  for  ensuring  data  storage  security,  processing  of  data  takes  place.  This  includes  splitting  of  file  into 
shares and then Fingerprinting of shares is performed in the third step. 
In fourth step, shares of the file are sent to different servers. The information about which share is sent to which server 
is stored in the cloud monitor. 
In  order  to  reconstruct  the  file,  user  enters  the  file  name  and  fingerprint  from  any  client  system.  These  details  are 
searched from the cloud monitor. 

  On comparison if it is determined that fingerprint doesn’t match then the shares are not integrated. 
 

If the fingerprint matched with the one  that was used at the time of storing the file on cloud then only the shares get 
integrated and the file will be retrieved. 

 
  Cloud monitor that is used in the proposed scheme is a server whose task is to keep track of which share is stored on which 
server in the cloud.  The steps followed in the proposed scheme are explained as follows: 

   After sending the file to the Cloud service provider, file is recursively divided into shares using information splitting scheme. 
In information splitting scheme, shares are created as follows: size of each share is taken as 200 bytes. Then number of shares 
(k) is calculated as k= (Size of file)/200).  If still some characters left then one more share is created i.e. k=((size of file)/200+1). 
After dividing the file into shares, encryption of shares is performed using AES algorithm. The key used for encryption is the 
key  corresponding  to  the  client’s  fingerprint  and  this  key  is  generated  using  RSA  algorithm.  These  encrypted  shares  are  then

Abstract—  The  collection  of  interconnected  servers  that  are  provisioned  dynamically  on  demand,  for 
the  execution  of  applications,  to  the  customer  is  referred  as  cloud  systems.  Cloud  computing  provides 
clients  the  facility  to  store  their  data  on  the  cloud;  hence  security  of  data  stored  on  the  servers  of 
datacenters of Cloud service providers is an important issue. This paper proposed a scheme that helps in 
ensuring the security of data stored in the servers of Cloud systems. The proposed scheme is based on 
two  methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in  maintaining 
confidentiality  and  integrity  of  data  and  Fingerprinting  helps  in  recovery  of  data.  The  property  of 
proposed scheme that makes it different from existing data storage schemes is that integrity is ensured 
by client. This property may help in gaining trust of clients.

I.   INTRODUCTION 

   Cloud  computing  can  be  defined  as  a  way  of  computing  in  which  dynamically  scalable  and  often  virtualized  resources  are 
provided as a services over the internet. Internet is not only a communication medium but, because of the reliable, affordable 
and ubiquitous broadband access, is becoming a powerful computing platform rather than running software and managing data 
on  the  desktop  computer  or  server,  user  are  able  to  execute  application  and  access  data  on  demand  from  the  cloud  (internet) 
anywhere  in  the  world  [1].  In  cloud  computing  model  there  are  three  service  models  and  four  deployment  models  which  are 
explained below.

The key intent of this research work is to investigate the existing security schemes and to ensure data confidentiality, integrity 
and authentication.  In this paper symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are adopted for the optimization of data 
security in cloud computing. 
   In  [11]  the  problem  of  ensuring  the  integrity  of  data  storage  in  Cloud  Computing    is  studied.  In  particular,  they  have 
considered the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic 
data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his 
data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The 
support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion,  is 
also  a  significant  step  toward  practicality,  since  services  in  Cloud  Computing  are  not  limited  to  archive  or  backup  data  only. 
While  prior  works  on  ensuring  remote  data  integrity  often  lacks  the  support  of  either  public  auditability  or  dynamic  data 
operations,  this  paper  achieves  both.  The  authors  first  identify  the  difficulties  and  potential  security  problems  of  direct 
extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for

the seamless integration of these two salient features in their protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, 
they  improve  the  existing  proof  of  storage  models  by  manipulating  the  classic  Merkle  Hash  Tree  construction  for  block  tag 
authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, they further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate 
signature  to  extend  the  main  result  into  a  multiuser  setting,  where  TPA  can  perform  multiple  auditing  tasks  simultaneously. 
Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure. 
   With  the  advent  of  the  World  Wide  Web  [12]  and  the  emergence  of  e-commerce  applications  and  social  networks, 
organizations  across  the  world  generate  a  large  amount  of  data  daily.  This  data  would  be  more  useful  to  cooperating 
organizations if they were able to share their data. Two major obstacles to this process of data sharing are providing a common 
storage  space  and  secure  access  to  the  shared  data.  In  this  paper  these  issues  are  addressed  by  combining  cloud  computing 
technologies  such  as  Hive  and  Hadoop  with  XACML  policy  based  security  mechanisms  that  provide  fine-grained  access  to 
resources. This paper further presents a web-based application that uses this combination and allows collaborating organizations 
to securely store and retrieve large amounts of data. 
   A  k-out-of-n  recursive  information  hiding  scheme  based  on  an  n-ary  tree  data  structure  is  described  in  [13].  In  recursive 
hiding  of  information,  the  user  encodes  additional  information  in  the  shares  of  the  secret  intended  to  be  originally  shared, 
without  an  expansion  in  the  size  of  the  latter.  The  proposed  scheme  has  applications  in  secure  distributed  storage  and 
information dispersal protocols. It may be used as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information, which may be used 
for authentication and verification of shares and the reconstructed secret itself. 
   The scheme proposed in [3] is introducing a Trusted Third Party, tasked with assuring specific security characteristics within a 
cloud environment. The proposed solution calls upon cryptography, specifically Public Key  Infrastructure operating in concert 
with  SSO  and  LDAP,  to  ensure  the  authentication,  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  involved  data  and  communications.  The 
solution, presents a  horizontal level of  service, available to  all implicated entities, that realizes a  security  mesh,  within  which 
essential trust is maintained. 
   A  recursive  computational  multi  secret  sharing  technique  is  presented  in  [14]  that  hides  k  -  2  secrets  of  size  b  each  into  n 
shares  of  a  single  secret  S  of  size  b,  such  that  any  k  of  the  n  shares  suffice  to  recreate  the  secret  S  as  well  as  all  the  hidden 
secrets. This may act as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information or used for authentication and verification  of 
shares and the secret itself. Further, such a recursive technique may be used as a computational secret sharing technique that has 
potential  applications  in  secure  and  reliable  storage  of  information  on  the  Web,  in  sensor  networks  and  information  dispersal 
schemes. The presented technique, unlike previous computational techniques, does not require the use of any encryption key or 
storage of public information. 
 
                                                                              III.   PRESENT WORK 
   The security of data stored on the severs of cloud is an important issue in cloud computing technology. In the present work a 
scheme  is  proposed  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security  of  data  stored  on  the  cloud.  The  proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two 
methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in  maintaining  confidentiality  and  integrity  of 
data and Fingerprinting helps in recovery of data. Since the fingerprints have zero collision property, only the original user can 
access or  modify the data. This property  may help  in gaining trust of clients. The property of proposed  scheme that  makes it 
different from existing data storage schemes is that integrity is ensured by client. The steps followed in the proposed scheme are 
as follows: 

 
 

 

 

In the first step, File is taken from the client.  
In  second  step,  for  ensuring  data  storage  security,  processing  of  data  takes  place.  This  includes  splitting  of  file  into 
shares and then Fingerprinting of shares is performed in the third step. 
In fourth step, shares of the file are sent to different servers. The information about which share is sent to which server 
is stored in the cloud monitor. 
In  order  to  reconstruct  the  file,  user  enters  the  file  name  and  fingerprint  from  any  client  system.  These  details  are 
searched from the cloud monitor. 

  On comparison if it is determined that fingerprint doesn’t match then the shares are not integrated. 
 

If the fingerprint matched with the one  that was used at the time of storing the file on cloud then only the shares get 
integrated and the file will be retrieved. 

 
  Cloud monitor that is used in the proposed scheme is a server whose task is to keep track of which share is stored on which 
server in the cloud.  The steps followed in the proposed scheme are explained as follows: 

   After sending the file to the Cloud service provider, file is recursively divided into shares using information splitting scheme. 
In information splitting scheme, shares are created as follows: size of each share is taken as 200 bytes. Then number of shares 
(k) is calculated as k= (Size of file)/200).  If still some characters left then one more share is created i.e. k=((size of file)/200+1). 
After dividing the file into shares, encryption of shares is performed using AES algorithm. The key used for encryption is the 
key  corresponding  to  the  client’s  fingerprint  and  this  key  is  generated  using  RSA  algorithm.  These  encrypted  shares  are  then

stored on the servers. The details like servers’ ip addresses and names of the shares with their respective fingerprint’s key are 
stored in cloud monitor. This adds security to the shares. If anyone attempts to attack the shares of the file, then fingerprint of 
the client/sender will be required. The fingerprint is then sent to client who is part of the group among which this file has to be 
shared. 

   When the client wants to retrieve the file from the cloud  he/she will give the name of the file and the respective fingerprint. 
The given fingerprint’s key is then generated.  These details are searched from the cloud monitor. If the fingerprint key matched 
with  the  key  that  is  used  for  encrypting  the  shares  of  the  file  at  the  time  of  storing  the  file  on  the  cloud,  then  the  shares  get 
decrypted  using  this  same  key  and  these  decrypted  shares  get  integrated  and  the  file  will  be  retrieved.  In  case  the  fingerprint 
does not match with the one whose key is used at the time of storing the file on cloud then the file will not be retrieved.

Abstract—  The  collection  of  interconnected  servers  that  are  provisioned  dynamically  on  demand,  for 
the  execution  of  applications,  to  the  customer  is  referred  as  cloud  systems.  Cloud  computing  provides 
clients  the  facility  to  store  their  data  on  the  cloud;  hence  security  of  data  stored  on  the  servers  of 
datacenters of Cloud service providers is an important issue. This paper proposed a scheme that helps in 
ensuring the security of data stored in the servers of Cloud systems. The proposed scheme is based on 
two  methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in  maintaining 
confidentiality  and  integrity  of  data  and  Fingerprinting  helps  in  recovery  of  data.  The  property  of 
proposed scheme that makes it different from existing data storage schemes is that integrity is ensured 
by client. This property may help in gaining trust of clients.

I.   INTRODUCTION 

   Cloud  computing  can  be  defined  as  a  way  of  computing  in  which  dynamically  scalable  and  often  virtualized  resources  are 
provided as a services over the internet. Internet is not only a communication medium but, because of the reliable, affordable 
and ubiquitous broadband access, is becoming a powerful computing platform rather than running software and managing data 
on  the  desktop  computer  or  server,  user  are  able  to  execute  application  and  access  data  on  demand  from  the  cloud  (internet) 
anywhere  in  the  world  [1].  In  cloud  computing  model  there  are  three  service  models  and  four  deployment  models  which  are 
explained below.

A.  Types of Service Models in Cloud 
 
   The cloud computing service models [2] are discussed below as: 
    
   1) Software as a Service (SaaS):  Under this layer, applications are delivered through the medium of the Internet as a service. 
Instead of  installing and  maintaining  software,  you simply access it  via the Internet, freeing  yourself from complex software 
and hardware management. 
  
  2) Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): To understand this cloud computing layer one needs to remember the  traditional computing 
model where each application  managed locally required hardware, an operating system, a database, middleware, Web  servers, 
and other software. One also needs to remember the team of network, database, and system management experts that are needed 
to keep everything up and running. With cloud computing, these services are now provided remotely by cloud providers under 
this layer. 
  
   3) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Products offered via this  mode  include the remote delivery (through the Internet) of a 
full computer infrastructure (e.g., virtual computers, servers, storage devices, etc.). 
 
B.  Deployment Models in Cloud computing 
 
 The four types of cloud [3] available in cloud computing are following: 
  
   1) Private cloud: The cloud infrastructure is operated for a private organization. It may be managed by the organization or a 
third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   2) Community cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  shared  by  several organizations and supports a specific community that 
has communal concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the 
organizations or a third party, and may exist on premise or off premise. 
 
   3) Public cloud: The cloud  infrastructure  is  made  available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by 
an organization selling cloud services. 
 
   4) Hybrid cloud: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain 
unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary  technology, that enables data and application portability 
(e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds). 
 
   There are various issues in Cloud that is preventing organizations from using Cloud. One of these issues is security. 
 
   Security: While leading Cloud services providers employ data storage and transmission encryption, user authentication, and 
authorization (data access) practices, many people worry about  the vulnerability of data to criminals like hackers, thieves, and 
disgruntled  employees.  Cloud  providers  are  enormously  sensitive  to  this  issue  and  apply  substantial  resources  to  mitigating 
concern [4].There are many issues that are faced by cloud computing security.  
 
   The major issues faced by Cloud Computing Security are discussed below: 
 
   1)  Insecure application programming interfaces: Cloud providers supply some kind of software interfaces for the customers, 
weak and user friendly interfaces exposes security issues [5]. 
    
   2)  Account, service and traffic hijacking: Stolen credentials used for this kind of attacks on the clouds which are usually taken 
by phishing, fraud or Denial of Services (DoS) [5]. 
 
   3)  Malicious Insider: A malicious insider is a person motivated to create a bad impact on the organization’s mission by taking 
action that compromises information confidentiality, integrity, and/or  availability. The  malicious activities of  an insider could 
potentially have an impact on: the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all kind of data and services with impact on the 
internal activities, organization’s reputation and customer trust. This is especially important in the case of cloud computing due 
to  the  fact  that  cloud  architectures  require  certain  roles,  like  cloud  administrators,  cloud  auditors,  cloud  security  personnel, 
which are extremely high-risk. Cloud’s economies of scale and flexibility are both a friend and a  foe from a security point of 
view. The management of security risk involves users, the technology itself, the cloud service providers, and the legal aspects of

the data and services being used. The massive concentrations of resources and data present a more attractive target to attackers, 
but cloud-based defenses can be more robust, scalable and cost-effective than traditional ones. To help reduce the threat, cloud 
computing stakeholders should invest in implementing security measures to ensure that the data is being kept secure and private 
throughout its lifecycle [6]. 
 
   4)    Data  loss/leakage:  Deletion  or  alteration  of  records  without  proper  backups  and  loss  of  encoding  key  make  the  cloud 
difficult to restore. Unauthorized access into cloud can leads to data theft and losses [5]. 
 
   Since cloud computing technology provides user the facility to store their data in the datacenters of cloud, security of data is 
an important concern. This  paper  proposed  a  scheme  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security of data stored on the cloud. The  
 proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two  methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in 
maintaining confidentiality and integrity of data and Fingerprinting helps in recovery of data. The property of proposed  scheme 
that  makes  it  different  from  existing  data  storage  schemes  is  that  integrity  is  ensured  by  client.  This  property  may  help  in 
gaining trust of clients. 
 

II.   LITERATURE REVIEW 

   The Cloud computing [5] concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic 
benefits are the main driver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational expenditure. In 
order for this to become reality, however, there are still some challenges to be solved. Most important among these are security 
and trust issues, since the user’s data has to be released to the Cloud and thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner. In 
contrast  to  traditional  solutions,  where  the  IT  services  are  under  proper  physical,  logical  and  personnel  controls,  Cloud 
Computing  moves  the  application  software  and  databases  to  the  large  data  centers,  where  the  management  of  the  data  and 
services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been 
well  understood.  Security  is  to  save  data  from  danger  and  vulnerability.  There  are  so  many  dangers  and  vulnerabilities  to  be 
handled. Various security issues and some of their solution are explained in this paper. This paper concentrates mainly on public 
cloud security issues and their solutions.  Data  should always be encrypted  when stored  (using separate  symmetric encryption 
keys)  and  transmitted.  If  this  is  implemented  appropriately,  even  if  another  tenant  can  access  the  data,  all  that  will  appear  is 
gibberish. So a method is proposed such that the whole data is encrypted along with the cryptographic key. 
   In [7] author has given a brief introduction on Cloud computing and touched some of the security issues related  to a cloud. 
Having explained the problems in the cloud, author has also proposed some solutions to the same with the help of algorithms 
like the DES and RAS Algorithms. 
   Cloud computing [8] in today’s world is making wide differences between it and other technologies. The critical data of users 
can be stolen by various means whereas cloud computing is still not a secure way to store users data. This paper tries provides a 
review  of  what  are  various  types  of  digital  watermarking  techniques  and  in  what  way  the  integrity  of  watermarking  can  be 
attacked so as throttle the system. The collaboration of digital watermarking when used for cloud computing can significantly 
result to make the system robust as well as secure user’s data. 
   Cloud  computing  [9]  is  the  way  of  providing  computing  resources  in  the  form  of  service  rather  than  a  product,  utilities  are 
provided to the users over internet. The main goal of cloud computing concept is to secure, protect the data and the processes 
which  come  under  the  property  of  users.  The  security  of  cloud  computing  environment  is  an  exclusive  research  area  which 
requires further development from both the academic and research communities. In cloud environment the computing resources 
are under the control of service provider, the third party auditor ensures the data integrity over out sourced data. In this paper 
digital  signature  method is proposed to protect the privacy and integrity of outsourced data in cloud environment. This paper 
used RSA algorithm for digital signature and for the process of encryption and decryption. 
   Increasing  demand  for  cloud  applications  [10]  has  led  to  an  ever  growing  need  for  security  mechanisms.  The  most  serious 
concerns are the possibility of lack of confidentiality, integrity and authentication among the cloud users and service providers. 
The key intent of this research work is to investigate the existing security schemes and to ensure data confidentiality, integrity 
and authentication.  In this paper symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are adopted for the optimization of data 
security in cloud computing. 
   In  [11]  the  problem  of  ensuring  the  integrity  of  data  storage  in  Cloud  Computing    is  studied.  In  particular,  they  have 
considered the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic 
data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his 
data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The 
support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion,  is 
also  a  significant  step  toward  practicality,  since  services  in  Cloud  Computing  are  not  limited  to  archive  or  backup  data  only. 
While  prior  works  on  ensuring  remote  data  integrity  often  lacks  the  support  of  either  public  auditability  or  dynamic  data 
operations,  this  paper  achieves  both.  The  authors  first  identify  the  difficulties  and  potential  security  problems  of  direct 
extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for

the seamless integration of these two salient features in their protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, 
they  improve  the  existing  proof  of  storage  models  by  manipulating  the  classic  Merkle  Hash  Tree  construction  for  block  tag 
authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, they further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate 
signature  to  extend  the  main  result  into  a  multiuser  setting,  where  TPA  can  perform  multiple  auditing  tasks  simultaneously. 
Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure.

resources. This paper further presents a web-based application that uses this combination and allows collaborating organizations 
to securely store and retrieve large amounts of data. 
   A  k-out-of-n  recursive  information  hiding  scheme  based  on  an  n-ary  tree  data  structure  is  described  in  [13].  In  recursive 
hiding  of  information,  the  user  encodes  additional  information  in  the  shares  of  the  secret  intended  to  be  originally  shared, 
without  an  expansion  in  the  size  of  the  latter.  The  proposed  scheme  has  applications  in  secure  distributed  storage  and 
information dispersal protocols. It may be used as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information, which may be used 
for authentication and verification of shares and the reconstructed secret itself.

essential trust is maintained. 
   A  recursive  computational  multi  secret  sharing  technique  is  presented  in  [14]  that  hides  k  -  2  secrets  of  size  b  each  into  n 
shares  of  a  single  secret  S  of  size  b,  such  that  any  k  of  the  n  shares  suffice  to  recreate  the  secret  S  as  well  as  all  the  hidden 
secrets. This may act as a steganographic channel to transmit hidden information or used for authentication and verification  of 
shares and the secret itself. Further, such a recursive technique may be used as a computational secret sharing technique that has 
potential  applications  in  secure  and  reliable  storage  of  information  on  the  Web,  in  sensor  networks  and  information  dispersal 
schemes. The presented technique, unlike previous computational techniques, does not require the use of any encryption key or 
storage of public information.

   The security of data stored on the severs of cloud is an important issue in cloud computing technology. In the present work a 
scheme  is  proposed  which  helps  in  ensuring  the  security  of  data  stored  on  the  cloud.  The  proposed  scheme  is  based  on  two 
methods  –  Information  splitting  and  Fingerprinting.  Information  splitting  helps  in  maintaining  confidentiality  and  integrity  of 
data and Fingerprinting helps in recovery of data. Since the fingerprints have zero collision property, only the original user can 
access or  modify the data. This property  may help  in gaining trust of clients. The property of proposed  scheme that  makes it 
different from existing data storage schemes is that integrity is ensured by client. The steps followed in the proposed scheme are 
as follows: 

 
 

 

 

In the first step, File is taken from the client.  
In  second  step,  for  ensuring  data  storage  security,  processing  of  data  takes  place.  This  includes  splitting  of  file  into 
shares and then Fingerprinting of shares is performed in the third step. 
In fourth step, shares of the file are sent to different servers. The information about which share is sent to which server 
is stored in the cloud monitor. 
In  order  to  reconstruct  the  file,  user  enters  the  file  name  and  fingerprint  from  any  client  system.  These  details  are 
searched from the cloud monitor. 

  On comparison if it is determined that fingerprint doesn’t match then the shares are not integrated. 
 

If the fingerprint matched with the one  that was used at the time of storing the file on cloud then only the shares get 
integrated and the file will be retrieved. 

 
  Cloud monitor that is used in the proposed scheme is a server whose task is to keep track of which share is stored on which 
server in the cloud.  The steps followed in the proposed scheme are explained as follows: 

   After sending the file to the Cloud service provider, file is recursively divided into shares using information splitting scheme. 
In information splitting scheme, shares are created as follows: size of each share is taken as 200 bytes. Then number of shares 
(k) is calculated as k= (Size of file)/200).  If still some characters left then one more share is created i.e. k=((size of file)/200+1). 
After dividing the file into shares, encryption of shares is performed using AES algorithm. The key used for encryption is the 
key  corresponding  to  the  client’s  fingerprint  and  this  key  is  generated  using  RSA  algorithm.  These  encrypted  shares  are  then

stored on the servers. The details like servers’ ip addresses and names of the shares with their respective fingerprint’s key are 
stored in cloud monitor. This adds security to the shares. If anyone attempts to attack the shares of the file, then fingerprint of 
the client/sender will be required. The fingerprint is then sent to client who is part of the group among which this file has to be 
shared. 

   When the client wants to retrieve the file from the cloud  he/she will give the name of the file and the respective fingerprint. 
The given fingerprint’s key is then generated.  These details are searched from the cloud monitor. If the fingerprint key matched 
with  the  key  that  is  used  for  encrypting  the  shares  of  the  file  at  the  time  of  storing  the  file  on  the  cloud,  then  the  shares  get 
decrypted  using  this  same  key  and  these  decrypted  shares  get  integrated  and  the  file  will  be  retrieved.  In  case  the  fingerprint 
does not match with the one whose key is used at the time of storing the file on cloud then the file will not be retrieved.

            IV.   RESULT 

   The proposed scheme is implemented in java and simulation is done using CloudSim tool. The performance of the proposed 
scheme is high as it satisfactorily meets the parameters of security i.e. confidentiality, integrity and recovery. By meeting these 
parameters, proposed scheme ensures data security. 
 

 

V. CONCLUSION 

   In  this  paper  a  methodology  is  proposed  for  ensuring  the  security  of  data  stored  on  the  servers  of  cloud  systems.  In  the 
proposed scheme, instead of storing the file on the single server, encrypted shares of the file are stored on different servers, and 
key  used  for  encryption  and  decryption  is  the  fingerprint’s  key  of  the  sender  and  since  the  fingerprints  have  zero  collision 
property this method ensures the security of data stored on the servers of the cloud. This scheme is best suited for those Cloud 
service providers where main focus is to give secured data storage services and space is not a problem. 
   In this paper, only one secret file from the client is securely stored. In future this scheme can be used for storing multiple files 
from the same client. This scheme may also be used in army for sending confidential information.
