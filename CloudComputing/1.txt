INTRODUCTION 

   Traditional application integration technologies are performed in a rigid and slow process that usually takes a long

scheduling bandwidth, storage and compute resources on the  fly  without required end-user knowledge of physical 
location and system configuration that delivers the service.  , Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, 
on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,  networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service 
provider  interaction.  Cloud  Computing  is  virtualized  compute  power  and  storage  delivered  via  platform-agnostic 
infrastructures  of  abstracted  hardware  and  software  accessed  over  the  Internet.  These  shared,  on-demand  IT 
resources,  are  created  and  disposed  of  efficiently,  are  dynamically  scalable  through  a  variety  of  programmatic 
interfaces  and  are  billed  variably  based  on  measurable  usage.  In  a  traditional  hosted  environment,  resources  are 
allocated based on peak load requirements. In cloud computing they can be dynamically allocated. 
   Virtualization,  in  computing,  is  the  creation  of  a  virtual  version  of  something,  such  as  a  hardware  platform, 
operating system, a storage device or network resources. Virtualization technologies promise great opportunities for 
reducing  energy  and  hardware  costs  through  server  consolidation.  Moreover,  virtualization  can  optimize  resource 
sharing  among  applications  hosted  in  different  virtual  machines  to  better  meet  their  resource  needs.  .  As  a  result 
more and more computing can be conducted in shared resource pools that act as private and public clouds. 
 
In this paper I focus on the motivation factors of cloud computing, review the several cloud deployment and service 
models.  It  also  explore  certain  benefits  of  cloud  computing  over  traditional  IT  service  environment-including 
scalability, flexibility, reduced capital and higher resource utilization -are considered as  adoption reasons for cloud 
computing environment. I also include security, privacy,  internet dependency and availability as avoidance issues. 
The later includes vertical scalability as technical challenge. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes the cloud computing  service  models and deployment  models.  Section  III presents the  motivation factors 
for  accepting  cloud  computing  and  avoidance  issues,  also  discuss  vertical  scaling  as  technical  challenge.  Finally, 
Section IV concludes the paper. 
 

II.  Anatomy of Cloud Computing 

 

2.1  Definition of Cloud computing 

Cloud computing is becoming one of the next IT industry Buzz words: users move out their data and applications to 
the remote “Cloud” and then access them in a simple And pervasive way. This is again a central processing use case. 
Similar  scenario  occurred  around  50  years  ago:  a  Time-sharing  computing  server  served  multiple  users.  Until  20 
years ago when personal computers came to us, data and programs were mostly located in local resources. Certainly 
currently  the  Cloud  computing  paradigms  not  a  recurrence  of  the  history.  50  years  ago  we  had  to  adopt  the  time-
sharing servers due to limited computing resources. 
Nowadays the Cloud computing comes into fashion due to the need to build complex IT infrastructures. Users have 
to  manage  various  software  installations,  configuration  and  updates.  Computing  resources  and  other  hardware  are 
prone to be outdated very soon. Therefore outsourcing computing platforms is a smart solution for users to handle 
complex IT infrastructures. 
At the current stage, the Cloud computing is still evolving and there exists no widely accepted definition. Based on 
our experience, we propose an early definition of Cloud computing as follows: 
A computing Cloud is a set of network enabled services, providing scalable, QoS guaranteed, normally personalized, 
inexpensive computing platforms on demand, which could be accessed in a simple and pervasive way. 
 

2.2  CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 

All Cloud computing is a set of IT services that are provided to a customer over a network on a leased basis and with 
the ability to scale up or down their service requirements. Usually cloud computing services are delivered by a third 
party  provider  who  owns  the  infrastructure.  It  advantages  to  mention  but  a  few  include  scalability,  resilience, 
flexibility, efficiency and out sourcing non-core activities. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for 
organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. There are two basic cloud models are discussed, first 
the Cloud service model and the second Cloud Deployment model.  

 

A. Cloud Service Model 

 
Cloud  computing  is  a  delivery  of  computing  where  massively  scalable  IT-related  capabilities  are  provided  ―as  a 
service  across  the  internet  to  numerous  external  clients.  This  term  effectively  reflects  the  different  facets  of  the 
Cloud  Computing  paradigm  which  can  be  found  at  different  infrastructure  levels.  Cloud  Computing  is  broadly 
classified into three services: ―IaaS", "PaaS" and "SaaS”. Cloud Computing have some different utility services.

1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) model:  The main concept behind this model is virtualization where user have 
virtual desktop and consumes the resources like network, storage, virtualized servers, routers and so on, supplied by 
cloud  service  provider.  .  Usage  fees  are  calculated  per  CPU  hour,  data  GB  stored  per  hour,  network  bandwidth 
consumed,  network  infrastructure  used  per  hour,  value  added  services  used,  e.g.,  monitoring,  auto-scaling  etc. 
Examples:  Storage  services  provided  by  AmazonS3,  Amazon  EBS.  Computation  services:  AmazonEC2,  Layered 
tech and so on. 
  
2) PaaS (Platform as a service) model: It refers to the environment that provides the runtime environment, software 
deployment  framework  and  component  on  pay  to  enable  the  direct  deployment  of  application  level  assets  or  web 
applications. PaaS is a platform where software can be developed, tested and deployed. It means the entire life cycle 
of software can be operated on a PaaS. This service model is dedicated to application developers, testers, deployers 
and  administrators.  Examples:  Google  App  Engine  (GAE),  Microsoft  Azure,  IBM  Smart  Cloud,  Amazon  EC2, 
salesforce.com and jelastic.com and so on. 
  
3)  SaaS  (Software  as  a  service):  Through  this  service  delivery  model  end  users  consume  the  software  application 
services  directly  over  network  according  to  on-demand  basis.  For  example,  Gmail  is  a  SaaS  where  Google  is  the 
provider  and  we  are  consumers.  Other  well  known  examples  of  PaaS  include  billing  services  provided  by  Arial 
system, op source. Financial services: Concur, workday, Backup and recovery services and so on.

INTRODUCTION 

   Traditional application integration technologies are performed in a rigid and slow process that usually takes a long 
time to build and deploy, requiring professional developers and domain experts. They are server-centric and thus do 
not  fully  utilize  the  computing  power  and  storage  capability  of  client  systems.  Since  the  face  of  the  Internet  is 
continually  changing,  as  new  services  and  novel  applications  appear  and  become  globally  noteworthy  at  an 
increasing pace. Nowadays the locus of computation is changing, with functions migrating to remote datacenters via 
Internet based communication. Computing and communication are being blended into new ways of using networked 
computing  systems.  Next  generation  networks  and  service  infrastructures  should  overcome  the  scalability, 
flexibility,  resilience  and  security  bottlenecks  of  current  network  and  service  architectures,  in  order  to  provide  a 
large  variety  of  services  and  opportunities,  adoptable  by  business  models  capable  of  dynamic  and  seamless 
utilization  of  IT  resources  based  on  user-  demand  across  a  multiplicity  of  devices,  networks,  providers,  service 
domains and social and business processes . 
   An  Envisioning  the  computing  utility  based  on  the  service  provisioning  model,  where  resources  are  readily 
available on demand, has led to contemporary computing paradigms that have emerged in the last decade, exploiting 
technological  advances  in  networked  computing  environments  e.g.  GRID  computing,  peer  to  peer  computing  and 
more recently cloud computing . Figure-1 shows the result as Cloud Computing from Evolution process of various 
computing  technologies.  Cloud  computing  is  a  new  infrastructure  deployment  environment  that  delivers  on  the 
promise  of  supporting  on-demand  services  like  computation,  software  and  data  access  in  a  flexible  manner  by

scheduling bandwidth, storage and compute resources on the  fly  without required end-user knowledge of physical 
location and system configuration that delivers the service.  , Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, 
on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,  networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service 
provider  interaction.  Cloud  Computing  is  virtualized  compute  power  and  storage  delivered  via  platform-agnostic 
infrastructures  of  abstracted  hardware  and  software  accessed  over  the  Internet.  These  shared,  on-demand  IT 
resources,  are  created  and  disposed  of  efficiently,  are  dynamically  scalable  through  a  variety  of  programmatic 
interfaces  and  are  billed  variably  based  on  measurable  usage.  In  a  traditional  hosted  environment,  resources  are 
allocated based on peak load requirements. In cloud computing they can be dynamically allocated. 
   Virtualization,  in  computing,  is  the  creation  of  a  virtual  version  of  something,  such  as  a  hardware  platform, 
operating system, a storage device or network resources. Virtualization technologies promise great opportunities for 
reducing  energy  and  hardware  costs  through  server  consolidation.  Moreover,  virtualization  can  optimize  resource 
sharing  among  applications  hosted  in  different  virtual  machines  to  better  meet  their  resource  needs.  .  As  a  result 
more and more computing can be conducted in shared resource pools that act as private and public clouds. 
 
In this paper I focus on the motivation factors of cloud computing, review the several cloud deployment and service 
models.  It  also  explore  certain  benefits  of  cloud  computing  over  traditional  IT  service  environment-including

II.  Anatomy of Cloud Computing 

 

2.1  Definition of Cloud computing 

Cloud computing is becoming one of the next IT industry Buzz words: users move out their data and applications to 
the remote “Cloud” and then access them in a simple And pervasive way. This is again a central processing use case. 
Similar  scenario  occurred  around  50  years  ago:  a  Time-sharing  computing  server  served  multiple  users.  Until  20 
years ago when personal computers came to us, data and programs were mostly located in local resources. Certainly 
currently  the  Cloud  computing  paradigms  not  a  recurrence  of  the  history.  50  years  ago  we  had  to  adopt  the  time-
sharing servers due to limited computing resources. 
Nowadays the Cloud computing comes into fashion due to the need to build complex IT infrastructures. Users have 
to  manage  various  software  installations,  configuration  and  updates.  Computing  resources  and  other  hardware  are 
prone to be outdated very soon. Therefore outsourcing computing platforms is a smart solution for users to handle 
complex IT infrastructures. 
At the current stage, the Cloud computing is still evolving and there exists no widely accepted definition. Based on 
our experience, we propose an early definition of Cloud computing as follows: 
A computing Cloud is a set of network enabled services, providing scalable, QoS guaranteed, normally personalized, 
inexpensive computing platforms on demand, which could be accessed in a simple and pervasive way. 
 

2.2  CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 

All Cloud computing is a set of IT services that are provided to a customer over a network on a leased basis and with 
the ability to scale up or down their service requirements. Usually cloud computing services are delivered by a third 
party  provider  who  owns  the  infrastructure.  It  advantages  to  mention  but  a  few  include  scalability,  resilience, 
flexibility, efficiency and out sourcing non-core activities. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for 
organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. There are two basic cloud models are discussed, first 
the Cloud service model and the second Cloud Deployment model.  

 

A. Cloud Service Model 

 
Cloud  computing  is  a  delivery  of  computing  where  massively  scalable  IT-related  capabilities  are  provided  ―as  a 
service  across  the  internet  to  numerous  external  clients.  This  term  effectively  reflects  the  different  facets  of  the 
Cloud  Computing  paradigm  which  can  be  found  at  different  infrastructure  levels.  Cloud  Computing  is  broadly 
classified into three services: ―IaaS", "PaaS" and "SaaS”. Cloud Computing have some different utility services.

Suruchee V.Nandgaonkar et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 733-738 

 
1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) model:  The main concept behind this model is virtualization where user have 
virtual desktop and consumes the resources like network, storage, virtualized servers, routers and so on, supplied by 
cloud  service  provider.  .  Usage  fees  are  calculated  per  CPU  hour,  data  GB  stored  per  hour,  network  bandwidth 
consumed,  network  infrastructure  used  per  hour,  value  added  services  used,  e.g.,  monitoring,  auto-scaling  etc. 
Examples:  Storage  services  provided  by  AmazonS3,  Amazon  EBS.  Computation  services:  AmazonEC2,  Layered 
tech and so on. 
  
2) PaaS (Platform as a service) model: It refers to the environment that provides the runtime environment, software 
deployment  framework  and  component  on  pay  to  enable  the  direct  deployment  of  application  level  assets  or  web 
applications. PaaS is a platform where software can be developed, tested and deployed. It means the entire life cycle 
of software can be operated on a PaaS. This service model is dedicated to application developers, testers, deployers 
and  administrators.  Examples:  Google  App  Engine  (GAE),  Microsoft  Azure,  IBM  Smart  Cloud,  Amazon  EC2, 
salesforce.com and jelastic.com and so on. 
  
3)  SaaS  (Software  as  a  service):  Through  this  service  delivery  model  end  users  consume  the  software  application 
services  directly  over  network  according  to  on-demand  basis.  For  example,  Gmail  is  a  SaaS  where  Google  is  the 
provider  and  we  are  consumers.  Other  well  known  examples  of  PaaS  include  billing  services  provided  by  Arial 
system, op source. Financial services: Concur, workday, Backup and recovery services and so on.

Fig-1 Types of Cloud Deployment Model 

 

 

 
1)  Public  cloud/external  cloud:  This  model  allows  cloud  environment  as  openly  or  publically  accessible.  Public 
cloud is off premise in which various enterprises can be used to deliver the services to users by taking it from third 
party.  
2)  Private  cloud/internal  cloud:  This  model  referred  to  on-premise  cloud  which  is  managed  or  owned  by  an 
organization to provide the high level control over cloud services and infrastructure. In other words private cloud is 
build specifically to provide the services within an organization for maintaining the security and privacy.  
3) Hybrid cloud/virtual private cloud model: This model compromised both private and public cloud models where 
cloud computing environment is hosted and managed by third party (off-premise) but some dedicated resources are 
privately used only by an organization.  
4) Community model: It allows the cloud computing environment which is shared or managed by number of related 
organizations. 
 

III.  MOTIVATING FACTORS AND CHALLENGES 

Cloud  systems  are  not  just  another  form  of  resource  provisioning  infrastructure  and  in  fact,  have  multiple 
opportunities  from  the  principles  for  cloud  infrastructures  that  will  enable  further  types  of  applications,  reduced 
development  and  provisioning  time  of  different  services.  Cloud  computing  has  particular  characteristics  that 
distinguish it from classical resource and service provisioning environments. 
 Infinitely (more or less) Scalable  
 Cost saving/less capital expenditure  
 Higher resource Utilization  
 Business agility  
 Disaster recovery and Back up  
 Device and Location Independence  
 
While reducing up-front IT cost or capital expenditure is the one of crucial reason for the adoption cloud computing, 
there  are  also  some  other  factors  that  encourages  the  various  organizations  for  the  adopting  the  cloud  computing. 
Participation  of  various  factors  for  encouraging  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing.  In  static  resource  allocation 
configurations  there  inevitably  exists  a  trade-off  between  capacity  deployment  and  resource  demand.  Cloud 
computing  shifts  the  location  of  resources  to  the  cloud  to  reduce  the  costs  associated  with  over-provisioning  (i.e. 
having  too  many  resources),  under-utilization  (i.e.  not  using  resources  adequately)  and  under-provisioning  (i.e. 
having too little resources). It also reduces the time required to provision resources to minutes, allowing applications 
to  quickly  scale  under-utilization  both  up  and  down,  as  the  workload  changes.  Therefore,  cloud  computing  is 
particularly well suited for applications with a variable workload that experience hourly, daily, weekly or monthly 
variability in utilization of resources. One example of such applications is online shops, which have to handle their 
peak loads at Deepawali time. Another example is university websites, which have to handle their peak loads during 
exam result time. In traditional (i.e. non-cloud) environments, over provisioning and under-utilization can hardly be 
avoided. There is an observation that in many companies the average utilization of application servers ranges from 5 
to 20 percent, meaning that many resources like CPU and RAM are idle at no peak times. On the other hand, if the 
companies  shrink  their  infrastructures  to  reduce  over-provisioning  and  under-utilization,  the  risk  of  under-
provisioning  will increase. While the costs of over-provisioning and  under-utilization can easily be calculated, the

1)  Public  cloud/external  cloud:  This  model  allows  cloud  environment  as  openly  or  publically  accessible.  Public 
cloud is off premise in which various enterprises can be used to deliver the services to users by taking it from third 
party.  
2)  Private  cloud/internal  cloud:  This  model  referred  to  on-premise  cloud  which  is  managed  or  owned  by  an 
organization to provide the high level control over cloud services and infrastructure. In other words private cloud is 
build specifically to provide the services within an organization for maintaining the security and privacy.  
3) Hybrid cloud/virtual private cloud model: This model compromised both private and public cloud models where 
cloud computing environment is hosted and managed by third party (off-premise) but some dedicated resources are 
privately used only by an organization.  
4) Community model: It allows the cloud computing environment which is shared or managed by number of related 
organizations. 
 

III.  MOTIVATING FACTORS AND CHALLENGES 

Cloud  systems  are  not  just  another  form  of  resource  provisioning  infrastructure  and  in  fact,  have  multiple 
opportunities  from  the  principles  for  cloud  infrastructures  that  will  enable  further  types  of  applications,  reduced 
development  and  provisioning  time  of  different  services.  Cloud  computing  has  particular  characteristics  that 
distinguish it from classical resource and service provisioning environments. 
 Infinitely (more or less) Scalable  
 Cost saving/less capital expenditure  
 Higher resource Utilization  
 Business agility  
 Disaster recovery and Back up  
 Device and Location Independence  
 
While reducing up-front IT cost or capital expenditure is the one of crucial reason for the adoption cloud computing, 
there  are  also  some  other  factors  that  encourages  the  various  organizations  for  the  adopting  the  cloud  computing. 
Participation  of  various  factors  for  encouraging  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing.  In  static  resource  allocation 
configurations  there  inevitably  exists  a  trade-off  between  capacity  deployment  and  resource  demand.  Cloud 
computing  shifts  the  location  of  resources  to  the  cloud  to  reduce  the  costs  associated  with  over-provisioning  (i.e. 
having  too  many  resources),  under-utilization  (i.e.  not  using  resources  adequately)  and  under-provisioning  (i.e. 
having too little resources). It also reduces the time required to provision resources to minutes, allowing applications 
to  quickly  scale  under-utilization  both  up  and  down,  as  the  workload  changes.  Therefore,  cloud  computing  is 
particularly well suited for applications with a variable workload that experience hourly, daily, weekly or monthly 
variability in utilization of resources. One example of such applications is online shops, which have to handle their 
peak loads at Deepawali time. Another example is university websites, which have to handle their peak loads during 
exam result time. In traditional (i.e. non-cloud) environments, over provisioning and under-utilization can hardly be 
avoided. There is an observation that in many companies the average utilization of application servers ranges from 5 
to 20 percent, meaning that many resources like CPU and RAM are idle at no peak times. On the other hand, if the 
companies  shrink  their  infrastructures  to  reduce  over-provisioning  and  under-utilization,  the  risk  of  under-
provisioning  will increase. While the costs of over-provisioning and  under-utilization can easily be calculated, the

Suruchee V.Nandgaonkar et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 733-738 

costs of under-provisioning are more difficult to calculate because under-provisioning can lead to a loss of users and 
zero  revenues.  Virtualization  technology  is  also  one  of  the  primary  reasons  of  popularity  of  cloud  computing 
because it provides a way to increase capacity or add capabilities on the fly without investing in new infrastructure, 
training new personnel, or licensing  new  software and  virtualization technology  play  the key delivery technology. 
Through Virtualization cloud computing removes the dependencies between software and the hardware that runs it.  

As we know, cloud computing has various motivating factors according to the perspective of adoption but 
there  is  still  long  way  for  cloud  computing  to  prove  itself  according  to  the  organization’s  trust  level.  There  are 
various reasons that warns us for the adoption of cloud computing.  

 
 Security  
Security issue has played the most important role in hindering Cloud computing acceptance. Various security issues, 
possible  in  cloud  computing  are:  availability,  integrity,  confidentiality,  data  access,  data  segregation,  privacy, 
recovery,  accountability,  multi-tenancy  issues  and  so  on.  Solution  to  various  cloud  security  issues  vary  through 
cryptography, particularly public key infrastructure (PKI),use of multiple cloud providers, standardization of APIs, 
improving virtual machines support and legal support. 
 
 Difficult to migrate  
It’s  not  very  easy  to  move  the  applications  from  an  enterprise  to  cloud  computing  environment  or  even  within 
different  cloud  computing  platforms  because  different  cloud  providers  support  different  application  architectures 
which are also dissimilar from enterprise application architectures. 
 
 Internet dependency – performance and availability  
Cloud  computing  services  rely  fully  on  the  availability,  speed,  quality  and  performance  of  internet  as  it  works  as 
carrier in between consumer and service provider. 
 
 Downtime and service level  
In  business  applications,  downtime  is  common  concern  because  every  minute  of  downtime  is  minute  in  which 
important  business  application  can’t  be  performed  which  degrades  the  performance  of  organization  as  well 
reputation  also..  Scalability  is  the  best  solution  to  increasing  and  maintaining  application  performance  in  cloud 
computing environments. But one of the  main technological challenge of cloud environment is  vertical scalability 
(Scale  up)  because  in  cloud  environment  elastic  scalability  is  not  only  currently  restricted  to  horizontal  scaling 
(Scale  out),  but  also  inefficient  as  it  tends  to  resource  over  usage  due  to  limited  scale  down  capabilities  and  full 
replication of instances rather than only of essential segments. Horizontal scaling is scaling through the addition of 
more machines or devices to the computing platform to handle the increased demand. Vertical Scaling, on the other 
hand, ability to scale the size of a server i.e. in this scaling the size of server is scaled either by resizing the server or 
by  replacing  that  server  to  bigger  one.  Vertical  scaling  can  handle  most  sudden,  temporary  peaks  in  application 
demand on cloud infrastructures. Traditionally, most businesses have best served by using vertical scaling methods 
as  long  as  possible  and  then  scaling  individual  parts  of  application  horizontally  but  in  Cloud  environment  the 
scenario  is  changed  and  most  businesses  firstly  served  by  using  horizontally  because  the  most  common  operating 
systems  do  not  support  on-the-fly  (without  rebooting)  changes  on  the  available  CPU  or  memory  to  support  this 
vertical  scaling‖  .Vertical  scaling  typically  involves  making  significant  changes  to  a  server's  core  configuration. 
Therefore, it's better to perform such changes manually and when try to set up scalable server arrays for (horizontal) 
auto  scaling  purposes,  and  then  cannot  change  an  existing  server's  configuration.  When  horizontal  scaling  is  used 
together  with  vertical  scaling,  it  ends  up  with  an  infrastructure  that  makes  the  most  efficient  use  of  computing 
resources. 
 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

 
Cloud computing have several benefits over traditional (non- cloud) environment and have capability to handle most 
sudden,  temporary  peaks  in  application  demand  on  cloud  infrastructures.  Virtualization  technology  provides  good 
support  to  achieve  aim  of  cloud  computing  like  higher  resource  utilization,  elasticity,  reducing  IT  cost  or  capital 
expenditure  to  handle  temporary  loads  as  well  as  cloud  computing  have  various  flexible  service  and  deployment 
models which is also one of the main issue of adopting this computing paradigm. Virtualization concepts have open 
shared nature which is responsible for the violation of security polices and laws as well as degrades their computing 
reputation and performance.  So there is need to focus on privacy and on solutions of various security problems to 
maintain the trust level of organization for deploying the cloud computing without any hesitation and also need of

service’  to  any  needed  users  i.e.  through  cloud  computing  we  can  access  anything  that  we  want  from  anywhere  to  any 
computer without worrying about anything like about their storage, cost, management and so on. In this paper I provide

INTRODUCTION 

   Traditional application integration technologies are performed in a rigid and slow process that usually takes a long 
time to build and deploy, requiring professional developers and domain experts. They are server-centric and thus do 
not  fully  utilize  the  computing  power  and  storage  capability  of  client  systems.  Since  the  face  of  the  Internet  is 
continually  changing,  as  new  services  and  novel  applications  appear  and  become  globally  noteworthy  at  an 
increasing pace. Nowadays the locus of computation is changing, with functions migrating to remote datacenters via 
Internet based communication. Computing and communication are being blended into new ways of using networked 
computing  systems.  Next  generation  networks  and  service  infrastructures  should  overcome  the  scalability, 
flexibility,  resilience  and  security  bottlenecks  of  current  network  and  service  architectures,  in  order  to  provide  a 
large  variety  of  services  and  opportunities,  adoptable  by  business  models  capable  of  dynamic  and  seamless 
utilization  of  IT  resources  based  on  user-  demand  across  a  multiplicity  of  devices,  networks,  providers,  service 
domains and social and business processes . 
   An  Envisioning  the  computing  utility  based  on  the  service  provisioning  model,  where  resources  are  readily 
available on demand, has led to contemporary computing paradigms that have emerged in the last decade, exploiting 
technological  advances  in  networked  computing  environments  e.g.  GRID  computing,  peer  to  peer  computing  and 
more recently cloud computing . Figure-1 shows the result as Cloud Computing from Evolution process of various 
computing  technologies.  Cloud  computing  is  a  new  infrastructure  deployment  environment  that  delivers  on  the 
promise  of  supporting  on-demand  services  like  computation,  software  and  data  access  in  a  flexible  manner  by

scheduling bandwidth, storage and compute resources on the  fly  without required end-user knowledge of physical 
location and system configuration that delivers the service.  , Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, 
on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,  networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service 
provider  interaction.  Cloud  Computing  is  virtualized  compute  power  and  storage  delivered  via  platform-agnostic 
infrastructures  of  abstracted  hardware  and  software  accessed  over  the  Internet.  These  shared,  on-demand  IT 
resources,  are  created  and  disposed  of  efficiently,  are  dynamically  scalable  through  a  variety  of  programmatic 
interfaces  and  are  billed  variably  based  on  measurable  usage.  In  a  traditional  hosted  environment,  resources  are 
allocated based on peak load requirements. In cloud computing they can be dynamically allocated. 
   Virtualization,  in  computing,  is  the  creation  of  a  virtual  version  of  something,  such  as  a  hardware  platform, 
operating system, a storage device or network resources. Virtualization technologies promise great opportunities for 
reducing  energy  and  hardware  costs  through  server  consolidation.  Moreover,  virtualization  can  optimize  resource 
sharing  among  applications  hosted  in  different  virtual  machines  to  better  meet  their  resource  needs.  .  As  a  result 
more and more computing can be conducted in shared resource pools that act as private and public clouds. 
 
In this paper I focus on the motivation factors of cloud computing, review the several cloud deployment and service 
models.  It  also  explore  certain  benefits  of  cloud  computing  over  traditional  IT  service  environment-including 
scalability, flexibility, reduced capital and higher resource utilization -are considered as  adoption reasons for cloud 
computing environment. I also include security, privacy,  internet dependency and availability as avoidance issues. 
The later includes vertical scalability as technical challenge. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes the cloud computing  service  models and deployment  models.  Section  III presents the  motivation factors 
for  accepting  cloud  computing  and  avoidance  issues,  also  discuss  vertical  scaling  as  technical  challenge.  Finally, 
Section IV concludes the paper. 
 

II.  Anatomy of Cloud Computing 

 

2.1  Definition of Cloud computing 

Cloud computing is becoming one of the next IT industry Buzz words: users move out their data and applications to 
the remote “Cloud” and then access them in a simple And pervasive way. This is again a central processing use case. 
Similar  scenario  occurred  around  50  years  ago:  a  Time-sharing  computing  server  served  multiple  users.  Until  20 
years ago when personal computers came to us, data and programs were mostly located in local resources. Certainly 
currently  the  Cloud  computing  paradigms  not  a  recurrence  of  the  history.  50  years  ago  we  had  to  adopt  the  time-
sharing servers due to limited computing resources. 
Nowadays the Cloud computing comes into fashion due to the need to build complex IT infrastructures. Users have 
to  manage  various  software  installations,  configuration  and  updates.  Computing  resources  and  other  hardware  are 
prone to be outdated very soon. Therefore outsourcing computing platforms is a smart solution for users to handle 
complex IT infrastructures. 
At the current stage, the Cloud computing is still evolving and there exists no widely accepted definition. Based on 
our experience, we propose an early definition of Cloud computing as follows: 
A computing Cloud is a set of network enabled services, providing scalable, QoS guaranteed, normally personalized, 
inexpensive computing platforms on demand, which could be accessed in a simple and pervasive way. 
 

2.2  CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 

All Cloud computing is a set of IT services that are provided to a customer over a network on a leased basis and with 
the ability to scale up or down their service requirements. Usually cloud computing services are delivered by a third 
party  provider  who  owns  the  infrastructure.  It  advantages  to  mention  but  a  few  include  scalability,  resilience, 
flexibility, efficiency and out sourcing non-core activities. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for 
organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. There are two basic cloud models are discussed, first 
the Cloud service model and the second Cloud Deployment model.  

 

A. Cloud Service Model 

 
Cloud  computing  is  a  delivery  of  computing  where  massively  scalable  IT-related  capabilities  are  provided  ―as  a 
service  across  the  internet  to  numerous  external  clients.  This  term  effectively  reflects  the  different  facets  of  the 
Cloud  Computing  paradigm  which  can  be  found  at  different  infrastructure  levels.  Cloud  Computing  is  broadly 
classified into three services: ―IaaS", "PaaS" and "SaaS”. Cloud Computing have some different utility services.

Suruchee V.Nandgaonkar et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 733-738 

 
1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) model:  The main concept behind this model is virtualization where user have 
virtual desktop and consumes the resources like network, storage, virtualized servers, routers and so on, supplied by 
cloud  service  provider.  .  Usage  fees  are  calculated  per  CPU  hour,  data  GB  stored  per  hour,  network  bandwidth 
consumed,  network  infrastructure  used  per  hour,  value  added  services  used,  e.g.,  monitoring,  auto-scaling  etc. 
Examples:  Storage  services  provided  by  AmazonS3,  Amazon  EBS.  Computation  services:  AmazonEC2,  Layered 
tech and so on. 
  
2) PaaS (Platform as a service) model: It refers to the environment that provides the runtime environment, software 
deployment  framework  and  component  on  pay  to  enable  the  direct  deployment  of  application  level  assets  or  web 
applications. PaaS is a platform where software can be developed, tested and deployed. It means the entire life cycle 
of software can be operated on a PaaS. This service model is dedicated to application developers, testers, deployers 
and  administrators.  Examples:  Google  App  Engine  (GAE),  Microsoft  Azure,  IBM  Smart  Cloud,  Amazon  EC2, 
salesforce.com and jelastic.com and so on. 
  
3)  SaaS  (Software  as  a  service):  Through  this  service  delivery  model  end  users  consume  the  software  application 
services  directly  over  network  according  to  on-demand  basis.  For  example,  Gmail  is  a  SaaS  where  Google  is  the 
provider  and  we  are  consumers.  Other  well  known  examples  of  PaaS  include  billing  services  provided  by  Arial 
system, op source. Financial services: Concur, workday, Backup and recovery services and so on.

important  business  application  can’t  be  performed  which  degrades  the  performance  of  organization  as  well 
reputation  also..  Scalability  is  the  best  solution  to  increasing  and  maintaining  application  performance  in  cloud 
computing environments. But one of the  main technological challenge of cloud environment is  vertical scalability 
(Scale  up)  because  in  cloud  environment  elastic  scalability  is  not  only  currently  restricted  to  horizontal  scaling 
(Scale  out),  but  also  inefficient  as  it  tends  to  resource  over  usage  due  to  limited  scale  down  capabilities  and  full 
replication of instances rather than only of essential segments. Horizontal scaling is scaling through the addition of 
more machines or devices to the computing platform to handle the increased demand. Vertical Scaling, on the other 
hand, ability to scale the size of a server i.e. in this scaling the size of server is scaled either by resizing the server or 
by  replacing  that  server  to  bigger  one.  Vertical  scaling  can  handle  most  sudden,  temporary  peaks  in  application 
demand on cloud infrastructures. Traditionally, most businesses have best served by using vertical scaling methods 
as  long  as  possible  and  then  scaling  individual  parts  of  application  horizontally  but  in  Cloud  environment  the 
scenario  is  changed  and  most  businesses  firstly  served  by  using  horizontally  because  the  most  common  operating 
systems  do  not  support  on-the-fly  (without  rebooting)  changes  on  the  available  CPU  or  memory  to  support  this 
vertical  scaling‖  .Vertical  scaling  typically  involves  making  significant  changes  to  a  server's  core  configuration. 
Therefore, it's better to perform such changes manually and when try to set up scalable server arrays for (horizontal) 
auto  scaling  purposes,  and  then  cannot  change  an  existing  server's  configuration.  When  horizontal  scaling  is  used 
together  with  vertical  scaling,  it  ends  up  with  an  infrastructure  that  makes  the  most  efficient  use  of  computing 
resources. 
 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

 
Cloud computing have several benefits over traditional (non- cloud) environment and have capability to handle most 
sudden,  temporary  peaks  in  application  demand  on  cloud  infrastructures.  Virtualization  technology  provides  good 
support  to  achieve  aim  of  cloud  computing  like  higher  resource  utilization,  elasticity,  reducing  IT  cost  or  capital 
expenditure  to  handle  temporary  loads  as  well  as  cloud  computing  have  various  flexible  service  and  deployment 
models which is also one of the main issue of adopting this computing paradigm. Virtualization concepts have open 
shared nature which is responsible for the violation of security polices and laws as well as degrades their computing 
reputation and performance.  So there is need to focus on privacy and on solutions of various security problems to 
maintain the trust level of organization for deploying the cloud computing without any hesitation and also need of

horizontal scaling.
