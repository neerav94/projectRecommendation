Abstract 

The  resource  allocation  is  the  basic  guarantee  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
university development strategy, while resource allocation mechanism is an effective control 
measure to strengthen the university management. So the importance of resource allocation 
has  caused  widespread  attention  and  concern  of  university  administrators.  Combining  with 
the  actual  situations  and  encountered  problems  of  university  resource  management,  we 
introduced  cloud  computing  ideas  and  proposed  a  cloud-computing-based  resource 
allocation  model  to  conduct  a  preliminary  exploration  and  research  on  this  issue.  We  first 
formulated  the  resource  allocation  problem,  and  then  proposed  the  resource  allocation 
concept  model  and  its  corresponding  application  model  in  universities.  Based  on  the 
proposed  model,  we  further  expanded  detailed  analyses  and  descriptions  on  resource 
definition  and  description,  resource  allocation  rules  and  methods,  resource  management 
mode,  and  a  general  mathematical  model  of  resource  allocation  optimization  in  university. 
Finally, we gave a cloud-computing-based university resource allocation framework to offer 
references and consult for further applications of technology based on cloud computing in the 
university  resource  construction,  aiming  to  achieve  optimal  university  resource  allocation 
and improve teaching quality and efficiency.

idea,  the  cloud-centric  innovative  applications  continue  to  produce.  We  should  design 
following the concept, i.e. Application as a Service (AaaS), and provide all the resources and 
functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-

Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user 

, 

. 

 
2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Abstract 

The  resource  allocation  is  the  basic  guarantee  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
university development strategy, while resource allocation mechanism is an effective control 
measure to strengthen the university management. So the importance of resource allocation 
has  caused  widespread  attention  and  concern  of  university  administrators.  Combining  with 
the  actual  situations  and  encountered  problems  of  university  resource  management,  we 
introduced  cloud  computing  ideas  and  proposed  a  cloud-computing-based  resource 
allocation  model  to  conduct  a  preliminary  exploration  and  research  on  this  issue.  We  first 
formulated  the  resource  allocation  problem,  and  then  proposed  the  resource  allocation 
concept  model  and  its  corresponding  application  model  in  universities.  Based  on  the 
proposed  model,  we  further  expanded  detailed  analyses  and  descriptions  on  resource 
definition  and  description,  resource  allocation  rules  and  methods,  resource  management 
mode,  and  a  general  mathematical  model  of  resource  allocation  optimization  in  university. 
Finally, we gave a cloud-computing-based university resource allocation framework to offer 
references and consult for further applications of technology based on cloud computing in the 
university  resource  construction,  aiming  to  achieve  optimal  university  resource  allocation 
and improve teaching quality and efficiency.

1. Introduction 

With  the  continuous  development  of  information  technology,  colleges  and  universities 
information technology has become an important part of the university's business, university 
leadership has been more attention with the teachers and students. Resources are the basis for 
development  and  the  essential  guarantee  for  higher  education  quality.  However,  the  actual 
rate  of  growth in  resources  development  of  universities  is far  from  meeting  the demand  for 
resources needed. With the expansion of colleges and universities, will inevitably lead to the 
relative  per  capita  possession  of  resources  reduced.  Obviously,  the  resource  management 
technology  in  university  is  also  facing  the  great  challenges  and  opportunities  with  the 
transition  from  the  traditional  management  techniques  to  the  information  resource 
modernization  and sharing  [1].  Furthermore,  in  recent  years,  the  emerging  cloud  computing 
technology  has  brought  new  opportunities  and  provided  a  new  way  of  thinking  for  the 
development of the resource management technology in university. 

Cloud computing as a new product with the times because of its powerful product features 
in  some  areas  has  been  the  basic  application  of  [2].  Cloud  computing  stores  the  data, 
applications  and  services  in  the  cloud,  takes  full  advantage  of  the  powerful  computation

capabilities of data center, achieves self-adaptability of user business systems. Based on this 
idea,  the  cloud-centric  innovative  applications  continue  to  produce.  We  should  design 
following the concept, i.e. Application as a Service (AaaS), and provide all the resources and 
functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-
computing-based  resource  allocation  model  in  detail.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  in 
Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

number of resources to be allocated to 

 users.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user 

, 

. 

 
2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Each node represents a specific classification in certain kind of resource categories in 
university. 

Leaf  node  is  the  node  with  no  children  nodes,  which  represents  the  minimum 
classified catalogue in the classification tree. 

 

 

Definition 3. The level of the resource classification tree is the maximum path length from 
the root to all nodes, i.e., the root node is at level 0, and the nodes whose parent node is root 
are at level 1, and so on. 

The first level of the tree represents first categories of the university resources, the second 
level of the tree represents second categories of the university resources, and so on, and the nth 
level  of  the  tree  represents  nth  categories  of  the  university  resources.  Each  node  represents 
some sort of a resource, whose parent node represents the upper classification of the current 
node  and  whose  children  nodes  represent  the  sub-classification  of  the  current  node.  We 
encode for each node in accordance with the following rules to generate: 

  According  to  the  experiences  and  statistical  data,  we  determine  the  maximum 
classified number of the nodes with the same parent node under each level of the tree 
and define several digits used to describe them. 

  At  a  certain  level  in  the  tree,  the  nodes  with  the  same  parent  node  are  orderly 

numbered from left to right. 

Then, the category code of any node in the tree can be composed by the description digit 
determined by the tree level and codes of all the nodes in the path. For example, the category 
codes  of  node  A  and  node  B  are  10201201201  and  10299299299  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. An Example of Resource Classification Tree and its Encoding 

 

According to the definition of the resource classification tree, we have established a multi-
layer  resource  classification  tree  to  form  a  university  resource  classification  system, 
facilitating unified maintenance and management of the university resource classification. In 
the  resource  classification  tree  architecture,  the  university  resources  will  be  divided  into 
several  categories,  each  category  is  divided  into  many  subcategories,  and  each  subcategory 
can  be  divided  into  much  smaller  subcategory,  and  so  on.  Thus,  each  category  has  a  class 
number  and  each  kind  of  resources  can  be  assigned  to  a  certain  category.  Assume  that 
category  code  of  any  resource  must  be  described  by  the  leaf  node  of  the  resource 
classification  tree,  through  which  we  can  trace  and  analyze  the  affiliations  and  various 
categories of the resource classification at all levels.

2.5. Resource Management and Allocation 

The  ownership  of  the  university  resources  belongs  to  the  university,  but  university 
administrations  or  units  are  authorized  to  manage  these  resources.  Therefore,  we  build  a 
resource  management  tree  based  on  university  organization  tree  to  analyze  the  resource 
management mode. 

According  to  the  management  and  usage  requirements  of  the  university  resources,  the 

resource allocation rules can be divided into two categories: 

  No  user  participation.  Administrative  departments  or  units  directly  allocate  their 

responsible resources in accordance with the corresponding resource rules. 

  User  participation.  Users  participate  in  the  resource  allocation  procedure,  such  as 
student’s  selecting  courses,  activity  ground  reservations  and  so  on.  Administrative 
departments  or  units  launch  resource  allocation  based  on  the  users’  requirements 
under certain rules. 

No  matter  what  kind  of  allocation  rules,  we  need  to  consider  user  permissions,  usage 

requirements, restrictions and other factors for the use of resources. 

Due  to  various  allocation  methods,  there  are  various  allocation  policies  in  the  rule 
constraints,  such  as  first  come  first  served  basis,  average  allocation,  random  allocation, 
resource  reservation,  etc.,  According  to  the  mathematical  modeling,  we  achieve  fair, 
reasonable  and  multi-win  resource  allocation  using  kinds  of  algorithms,  such  as  heuristic 
algorithm, bionic algorithm, intelligent computing and so on. 
 
2.6. The Mathematical Model of Resource Allocation Optimization 

The resource  allocation issue  can  be  considered  as a multi-constraint and  multi-objective 
programming problem, aiming to optimize the user satisfaction, resource utilization and costs, 
and ensuring to optimize resource allocation for each category at the same time to make all 
resources  allocated  to  achieve  optimization  overall.  Therefore  optimization  of  resource 
allocation  strategy  can  be  an  interesting  and  challenging  task.  A  classical  optimal  resource 
allocation problem can be presented as: 

                                   

                                             (1)

1. Introduction 

With  the  continuous  development  of  information  technology,  colleges  and  universities 
information technology has become an important part of the university's business, university 
leadership has been more attention with the teachers and students. Resources are the basis for 
development  and  the  essential  guarantee  for  higher  education  quality.  However,  the  actual 
rate  of  growth in  resources  development  of  universities  is far  from  meeting  the demand  for 
resources needed. With the expansion of colleges and universities, will inevitably lead to the 
relative  per  capita  possession  of  resources  reduced.  Obviously,  the  resource  management 
technology  in  university  is  also  facing  the  great  challenges  and  opportunities  with  the 
transition  from  the  traditional  management  techniques  to  the  information  resource 
modernization  and sharing  [1].  Furthermore,  in  recent  years,  the  emerging  cloud  computing 
technology  has  brought  new  opportunities  and  provided  a  new  way  of  thinking  for  the 
development of the resource management technology in university. 

Cloud computing as a new product with the times because of its powerful product features 
in  some  areas  has  been  the  basic  application  of  [2].  Cloud  computing  stores  the  data,

capabilities of data center, achieves self-adaptability of user business systems. Based on this 
idea,  the  cloud-centric  innovative  applications  continue  to  produce.  We  should  design 
following the concept, i.e. Application as a Service (AaaS), and provide all the resources and 
functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-
computing-based  resource  allocation  model  in  detail.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  in 
Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

number of resources to be allocated to 

 users.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user 

, 

. 

 
2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Each node represents a specific classification in certain kind of resource categories in 
university. 

Leaf  node  is  the  node  with  no  children  nodes,  which  represents  the  minimum 
classified catalogue in the classification tree. 

 

 

Definition 3. The level of the resource classification tree is the maximum path length from 
the root to all nodes, i.e., the root node is at level 0, and the nodes whose parent node is root 
are at level 1, and so on. 

The first level of the tree represents first categories of the university resources, the second 
level of the tree represents second categories of the university resources, and so on, and the nth 
level  of  the  tree  represents  nth  categories  of  the  university  resources.  Each  node  represents 
some sort of a resource, whose parent node represents the upper classification of the current 
node  and  whose  children  nodes  represent  the  sub-classification  of  the  current  node.  We 
encode for each node in accordance with the following rules to generate: 

  According  to  the  experiences  and  statistical  data,  we  determine  the  maximum 
classified number of the nodes with the same parent node under each level of the tree 
and define several digits used to describe them. 

  At  a  certain  level  in  the  tree,  the  nodes  with  the  same  parent  node  are  orderly 

numbered from left to right. 

Then, the category code of any node in the tree can be composed by the description digit 
determined by the tree level and codes of all the nodes in the path. For example, the category 
codes  of  node  A  and  node  B  are  10201201201  and  10299299299  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. An Example of Resource Classification Tree and its Encoding 

 

According to the definition of the resource classification tree, we have established a multi-
layer  resource  classification  tree  to  form  a  university  resource  classification  system, 
facilitating unified maintenance and management of the university resource classification. In 
the  resource  classification  tree  architecture,  the  university  resources  will  be  divided  into 
several  categories,  each  category  is  divided  into  many  subcategories,  and  each  subcategory 
can  be  divided  into  much  smaller  subcategory,  and  so  on.  Thus,  each  category  has  a  class 
number  and  each  kind  of  resources  can  be  assigned  to  a  certain  category.  Assume  that 
category  code  of  any  resource  must  be  described  by  the  leaf  node  of  the  resource 
classification  tree,  through  which  we  can  trace  and  analyze  the  affiliations  and  various 
categories of the resource classification at all levels.

The  ownership  of  the  university  resources  belongs  to  the  university,  but  university 
administrations  or  units  are  authorized  to  manage  these  resources.  Therefore,  we  build  a 
resource  management  tree  based  on  university  organization  tree  to  analyze  the  resource 
management mode. 

According  to  the  management  and  usage  requirements  of  the  university  resources,  the 

resource allocation rules can be divided into two categories: 

  No  user  participation.  Administrative  departments  or  units  directly  allocate  their 

responsible resources in accordance with the corresponding resource rules. 

  User  participation.  Users  participate  in  the  resource  allocation  procedure,  such  as 
student’s  selecting  courses,  activity  ground  reservations  and  so  on.  Administrative

No  matter  what  kind  of  allocation  rules,  we  need  to  consider  user  permissions,  usage

Due  to  various  allocation  methods,  there  are  various  allocation  policies  in  the  rule 
constraints,  such  as  first  come  first  served  basis,  average  allocation,  random  allocation, 
resource  reservation,  etc.,  According  to  the  mathematical  modeling,  we  achieve  fair, 
reasonable  and  multi-win  resource  allocation  using  kinds  of  algorithms,  such  as  heuristic

the case of cloud computing, the resources are elastic, i.e., 

 and

a static parameter. Therefore, it is an important research task to investigate optimal resource 

allocation algorithms, as presented in [3], but not assuming

online  monitoring  of

 is  necessary  to  decide  the  best  time  for  allocation  or

3. The Application of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 
 
3.1. Cloud Computing Overview 

Cloud computing is a development and convergence product of grid computing, distributed 
computing,  virtualization  and  other  computer  technology  and  network  technology  [4,  5].  A 
core concept of cloud computing is that by continuously improving the processing capability 
of  cloud,  thereby  reducing  the  processing  burden  on  the  user  terminal,  the  user  terminals 
eventually  reduced  to  a  simple  input  and  output  devices,  and  can  enjoy  on-demand  the 
powerful computing processing capability of cloud. Cloud computing is a way of computing 
mode to provide dynamic scalable virtual resources using Internet as a service, which can be 
expressed  as  four  kinds  of  deployment  models,  three  kinds  of  service  models  and  seven 
characteristics, as shown in Figure 5. 
 

Figure 5. Cloud Computing Manifestations 

 

3.2. The Architecture of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 

The resource allocation model belongs to SaaS research category, and its cloud computing 
based architecture is shown in Figure 6. The architecture is based on the popular B/S service 
mode, including service terminal devices and cloud computing platform. Users through such 
as  the  mobile  terminal,  personal  computer  or  temporary  offline  on-demand  access  various 
resource  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  platform.  The  cloud  computing  platform  is 
composed of physical layer, virtual layer and application layer.

functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-
computing-based  resource  allocation  model  in  detail.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  in 
Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user 

, 

. 

 
2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Each node represents a specific classification in certain kind of resource categories in 
university. 

Leaf  node  is  the  node  with  no  children  nodes,  which  represents  the  minimum 
classified catalogue in the classification tree. 

 

 

Definition 3. The level of the resource classification tree is the maximum path length from 
the root to all nodes, i.e., the root node is at level 0, and the nodes whose parent node is root 
are at level 1, and so on. 

The first level of the tree represents first categories of the university resources, the second 
level of the tree represents second categories of the university resources, and so on, and the nth 
level  of  the  tree  represents  nth  categories  of  the  university  resources.  Each  node  represents 
some sort of a resource, whose parent node represents the upper classification of the current 
node  and  whose  children  nodes  represent  the  sub-classification  of  the  current  node.  We 
encode for each node in accordance with the following rules to generate: 

  According  to  the  experiences  and  statistical  data,  we  determine  the  maximum 
classified number of the nodes with the same parent node under each level of the tree 
and define several digits used to describe them. 

  At  a  certain  level  in  the  tree,  the  nodes  with  the  same  parent  node  are  orderly 

numbered from left to right. 

Then, the category code of any node in the tree can be composed by the description digit 
determined by the tree level and codes of all the nodes in the path. For example, the category 
codes  of  node  A  and  node  B  are  10201201201  and  10299299299  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. An Example of Resource Classification Tree and its Encoding 

 

According to the definition of the resource classification tree, we have established a multi-
layer  resource  classification  tree  to  form  a  university  resource  classification  system, 
facilitating unified maintenance and management of the university resource classification. In 
the  resource  classification  tree  architecture,  the  university  resources  will  be  divided  into 
several  categories,  each  category  is  divided  into  many  subcategories,  and  each  subcategory 
can  be  divided  into  much  smaller  subcategory,  and  so  on.  Thus,  each  category  has  a  class 
number  and  each  kind  of  resources  can  be  assigned  to  a  certain  category.  Assume  that 
category  code  of  any  resource  must  be  described  by  the  leaf  node  of  the  resource 
classification  tree,  through  which  we  can  trace  and  analyze  the  affiliations  and  various 
categories of the resource classification at all levels.

2.5. Resource Management and Allocation 

The  ownership  of  the  university  resources  belongs  to  the  university,  but  university 
administrations  or  units  are  authorized  to  manage  these  resources.  Therefore,  we  build  a 
resource  management  tree  based  on  university  organization  tree  to  analyze  the  resource 
management mode. 

According  to  the  management  and  usage  requirements  of  the  university  resources,  the 

resource allocation rules can be divided into two categories: 

  No  user  participation.  Administrative  departments  or  units  directly  allocate  their 

responsible resources in accordance with the corresponding resource rules. 

  User  participation.  Users  participate  in  the  resource  allocation  procedure,  such  as 
student’s  selecting  courses,  activity  ground  reservations  and  so  on.  Administrative 
departments  or  units  launch  resource  allocation  based  on  the  users’  requirements 
under certain rules. 

No  matter  what  kind  of  allocation  rules,  we  need  to  consider  user  permissions,  usage 

requirements, restrictions and other factors for the use of resources. 

Due  to  various  allocation  methods,  there  are  various  allocation  policies  in  the  rule 
constraints,  such  as  first  come  first  served  basis,  average  allocation,  random  allocation, 
resource  reservation,  etc.,  According  to  the  mathematical  modeling,  we  achieve  fair, 
reasonable  and  multi-win  resource  allocation  using  kinds  of  algorithms,  such  as  heuristic 
algorithm, bionic algorithm, intelligent computing and so on. 
 
2.6. The Mathematical Model of Resource Allocation Optimization 

The resource  allocation issue  can  be  considered  as a multi-constraint and  multi-objective 
programming problem, aiming to optimize the user satisfaction, resource utilization and costs, 
and ensuring to optimize resource allocation for each category at the same time to make all 
resources  allocated  to  achieve  optimization  overall.  Therefore  optimization  of  resource 
allocation  strategy  can  be  an  interesting  and  challenging  task.  A  classical  optimal  resource 
allocation problem can be presented as: 

                                   

                                             (1) 

s.t.            

                                                              (2) 

                                                                (3) 

                                                             (4) 

                                    (5) 

where  objective  value  function 

 becomes  minimized  (e.g.,  cost)  or 

maximized  (e.g.,  profit)  through  the  comprehensive  consideration  of  many  factors.  The 
variable  xij  represents  the  amount  of  resources  with  category  j  allocated  to  user  i  and  the

variable  xi  represents  the  amount  of  all  resources  allocated  to  user  i.

amount of resources with category j and

the case of cloud computing, the resources are elastic, i.e., 

 and 

 cannot be regarded as 

a static parameter. Therefore, it is an important research task to investigate optimal resource 

allocation algorithms, as presented in [3], but not assuming 

 or 

  as a fixed value. Thus 

online  monitoring  of 

 or 

 is  necessary  to  decide  the  best  time  for  allocation  or 

reallocation towards optimization. 
 
3. The Application of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 
 
3.1. Cloud Computing Overview 

Cloud computing is a development and convergence product of grid computing, distributed 
computing,  virtualization  and  other  computer  technology  and  network  technology  [4,  5].  A 
core concept of cloud computing is that by continuously improving the processing capability 
of  cloud,  thereby  reducing  the  processing  burden  on  the  user  terminal,  the  user  terminals 
eventually  reduced  to  a  simple  input  and  output  devices,  and  can  enjoy  on-demand  the 
powerful computing processing capability of cloud. Cloud computing is a way of computing 
mode to provide dynamic scalable virtual resources using Internet as a service, which can be 
expressed  as  four  kinds  of  deployment  models,  three  kinds  of  service  models  and  seven 
characteristics, as shown in Figure 5. 
 

Figure 5. Cloud Computing Manifestations 

 

3.2. The Architecture of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 

The resource allocation model belongs to SaaS research category, and its cloud computing 
based architecture is shown in Figure 6. The architecture is based on the popular B/S service 
mode, including service terminal devices and cloud computing platform. Users through such 
as  the  mobile  terminal,  personal  computer  or  temporary  offline  on-demand  access  various 
resource  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  platform.  The  cloud  computing  platform  is 
composed of physical layer, virtual layer and application layer.

Physical layer provides computing, network and storage resources to the upper layer in the 
form  of  resource  pools.  Virtual  layer  through  virtualization  management  platform  fully 
integrates and efficiently utilizes computing, network and storage resources. According to the 
function,  application  layer  is  divided  into  management,  service  and  data  modules,  which 
orients  different  service  objects  and  provides  different  application  services.  Management 
module  provides  authentication,  billing,  security  and  other  management  functions  of  the 
cloud computing platform. Service module provides management-related specific businesses 
in  the  university  resource  allocation,  such  as  resource  information  inquiry,  resource  usage 
applying, resource allocation results inquiry, resource management, etc., providing service on 
demand  based  on the  users’  needs.  Data  module is the  storage  of all  the entities  in the  data 
model  and  is  part  of  the  basis  for  management  and  services.  User  layer,  including  teachers 
and students, staffs in the university as well as possible authorized social users, supports users 
in  different  roles  through  mobile  terminals,  personal  computers  and  a  variety  of  ways  to 
access or manage the data in the application layer.

4. Conclusions 

Cloud  computing  is  a  research  hotspot  in  IT  fields,  which  utilizes  virtualization 
technology,  integrates  distributed  computing,  storage,  data,  applications  and  other 
resources,  provides  collaborative  computing  model  and  strong  information  processing 
capabilities.  A  new  idea  which  is  applying  cloud  computing  to  the  resource 
management  in  universities  is  presented  in  this  paper,  for  solving  shortcomings  in  the 
current  inefficiency  resource  management,  lack  of  resource  information  timely 
communication  and  resource  sharing.  At  present  this  model  still  exist  some  imperfect 
places, pending further research, improvement and practice.

Abstract 

The  resource  allocation  is  the  basic  guarantee  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
university development strategy, while resource allocation mechanism is an effective control 
measure to strengthen the university management. So the importance of resource allocation 
has  caused  widespread  attention  and  concern  of  university  administrators.  Combining  with 
the  actual  situations  and  encountered  problems  of  university  resource  management,  we 
introduced  cloud  computing  ideas  and  proposed  a  cloud-computing-based  resource 
allocation  model  to  conduct  a  preliminary  exploration  and  research  on  this  issue.  We  first 
formulated  the  resource  allocation  problem,  and  then  proposed  the  resource  allocation 
concept  model  and  its  corresponding  application  model  in  universities.  Based  on  the 
proposed  model,  we  further  expanded  detailed  analyses  and  descriptions  on  resource 
definition  and  description,  resource  allocation  rules  and  methods,  resource  management 
mode,  and  a  general  mathematical  model  of  resource  allocation  optimization  in  university. 
Finally, we gave a cloud-computing-based university resource allocation framework to offer 
references and consult for further applications of technology based on cloud computing in the 
university  resource  construction,  aiming  to  achieve  optimal  university  resource  allocation 
and improve teaching quality and efficiency.

1. Introduction 

With  the  continuous  development  of  information  technology,  colleges  and  universities 
information technology has become an important part of the university's business, university 
leadership has been more attention with the teachers and students. Resources are the basis for 
development  and  the  essential  guarantee  for  higher  education  quality.  However,  the  actual 
rate  of  growth in  resources  development  of  universities  is far  from  meeting  the demand  for 
resources needed. With the expansion of colleges and universities, will inevitably lead to the 
relative  per  capita  possession  of  resources  reduced.  Obviously,  the  resource  management 
technology  in  university  is  also  facing  the  great  challenges  and  opportunities  with  the 
transition  from  the  traditional  management  techniques  to  the  information  resource 
modernization  and sharing  [1].  Furthermore,  in  recent  years,  the  emerging  cloud  computing 
technology  has  brought  new  opportunities  and  provided  a  new  way  of  thinking  for  the 
development of the resource management technology in university. 

Cloud computing as a new product with the times because of its powerful product features 
in  some  areas  has  been  the  basic  application  of  [2].  Cloud  computing  stores  the  data, 
applications  and  services  in  the  cloud,  takes  full  advantage  of  the  powerful  computation

capabilities of data center, achieves self-adaptability of user business systems. Based on this 
idea,  the  cloud-centric  innovative  applications  continue  to  produce.  We  should  design 
following the concept, i.e. Application as a Service (AaaS), and provide all the resources and 
functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-
computing-based  resource  allocation  model  in  detail.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  in 
Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user

2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Each node represents a specific classification in certain kind of resource categories in 
university. 

Leaf  node  is  the  node  with  no  children  nodes,  which  represents  the  minimum 
classified catalogue in the classification tree. 

 

 

Definition 3. The level of the resource classification tree is the maximum path length from 
the root to all nodes, i.e., the root node is at level 0, and the nodes whose parent node is root 
are at level 1, and so on. 

The first level of the tree represents first categories of the university resources, the second 
level of the tree represents second categories of the university resources, and so on, and the nth 
level  of  the  tree  represents  nth  categories  of  the  university  resources.  Each  node  represents 
some sort of a resource, whose parent node represents the upper classification of the current 
node  and  whose  children  nodes  represent  the  sub-classification  of  the  current  node.  We 
encode for each node in accordance with the following rules to generate: 

  According  to  the  experiences  and  statistical  data,  we  determine  the  maximum 
classified number of the nodes with the same parent node under each level of the tree 
and define several digits used to describe them. 

  At  a  certain  level  in  the  tree,  the  nodes  with  the  same  parent  node  are  orderly 

numbered from left to right. 

Then, the category code of any node in the tree can be composed by the description digit 
determined by the tree level and codes of all the nodes in the path. For example, the category 
codes  of  node  A  and  node  B  are  10201201201  and  10299299299  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. An Example of Resource Classification Tree and its Encoding 

 

According to the definition of the resource classification tree, we have established a multi-
layer  resource  classification  tree  to  form  a  university  resource  classification  system, 
facilitating unified maintenance and management of the university resource classification. In 
the  resource  classification  tree  architecture,  the  university  resources  will  be  divided  into 
several  categories,  each  category  is  divided  into  many  subcategories,  and  each  subcategory 
can  be  divided  into  much  smaller  subcategory,  and  so  on.  Thus,  each  category  has  a  class 
number  and  each  kind  of  resources  can  be  assigned  to  a  certain  category.  Assume  that 
category  code  of  any  resource  must  be  described  by  the  leaf  node  of  the  resource 
classification  tree,  through  which  we  can  trace  and  analyze  the  affiliations  and  various 
categories of the resource classification at all levels.

2.5. Resource Management and Allocation 

The  ownership  of  the  university  resources  belongs  to  the  university,  but  university 
administrations  or  units  are  authorized  to  manage  these  resources.  Therefore,  we  build  a 
resource  management  tree  based  on  university  organization  tree  to  analyze  the  resource 
management mode. 

According  to  the  management  and  usage  requirements  of  the  university  resources,  the 

resource allocation rules can be divided into two categories: 

  No  user  participation.  Administrative  departments  or  units  directly  allocate  their 

responsible resources in accordance with the corresponding resource rules. 

  User  participation.  Users  participate  in  the  resource  allocation  procedure,  such  as 
student’s  selecting  courses,  activity  ground  reservations  and  so  on.  Administrative 
departments  or  units  launch  resource  allocation  based  on  the  users’  requirements 
under certain rules. 

No  matter  what  kind  of  allocation  rules,  we  need  to  consider  user  permissions,  usage 

requirements, restrictions and other factors for the use of resources. 

Due  to  various  allocation  methods,  there  are  various  allocation  policies  in  the  rule 
constraints,  such  as  first  come  first  served  basis,  average  allocation,  random  allocation, 
resource  reservation,  etc.,  According  to  the  mathematical  modeling,  we  achieve  fair, 
reasonable  and  multi-win  resource  allocation  using  kinds  of  algorithms,  such  as  heuristic 
algorithm, bionic algorithm, intelligent computing and so on. 
 
2.6. The Mathematical Model of Resource Allocation Optimization 

The resource  allocation issue  can  be  considered  as a multi-constraint and  multi-objective 
programming problem, aiming to optimize the user satisfaction, resource utilization and costs, 
and ensuring to optimize resource allocation for each category at the same time to make all 
resources  allocated  to  achieve  optimization  overall.  Therefore  optimization  of  resource 
allocation  strategy  can  be  an  interesting  and  challenging  task.  A  classical  optimal  resource 
allocation problem can be presented as: 

                                   

                                             (1) 

s.t.

                                                                (3) 

                                                             (4) 

                                    (5) 

where  objective  value  function 

 becomes  minimized  (e.g.,  cost)  or 

maximized  (e.g.,  profit)  through  the  comprehensive  consideration  of  many  factors.  The 
variable  xij  represents  the  amount  of  resources  with  category  j  allocated  to  user  i  and  the

variable  xi  represents  the  amount  of  all  resources  allocated  to  user  i. 

 represents  the 

amount of resources with category j and 

 represents the number of resource categories. In 

the case of cloud computing, the resources are elastic, i.e., 

 and 

 cannot be regarded as 

a static parameter. Therefore, it is an important research task to investigate optimal resource 

allocation algorithms, as presented in [3], but not assuming 

 or 

  as a fixed value. Thus 

online  monitoring  of 

 or 

 is  necessary  to  decide  the  best  time  for  allocation  or 

reallocation towards optimization. 
 
3. The Application of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 
 
3.1. Cloud Computing Overview 

Cloud computing is a development and convergence product of grid computing, distributed 
computing,  virtualization  and  other  computer  technology  and  network  technology  [4,  5].  A 
core concept of cloud computing is that by continuously improving the processing capability 
of  cloud,  thereby  reducing  the  processing  burden  on  the  user  terminal,  the  user  terminals 
eventually  reduced  to  a  simple  input  and  output  devices,  and  can  enjoy  on-demand  the 
powerful computing processing capability of cloud. Cloud computing is a way of computing 
mode to provide dynamic scalable virtual resources using Internet as a service, which can be 
expressed  as  four  kinds  of  deployment  models,  three  kinds  of  service  models  and  seven 
characteristics, as shown in Figure 5. 
 

Figure 5. Cloud Computing Manifestations 

 

3.2. The Architecture of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 

The resource allocation model belongs to SaaS research category, and its cloud computing 
based architecture is shown in Figure 6. The architecture is based on the popular B/S service 
mode, including service terminal devices and cloud computing platform. Users through such 
as  the  mobile  terminal,  personal  computer  or  temporary  offline  on-demand  access  various 
resource  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  platform.  The  cloud  computing  platform  is 
composed of physical layer, virtual layer and application layer.

Physical layer provides computing, network and storage resources to the upper layer in the 
form  of  resource  pools.  Virtual  layer  through  virtualization  management  platform  fully 
integrates and efficiently utilizes computing, network and storage resources. According to the 
function,  application  layer  is  divided  into  management,  service  and  data  modules,  which 
orients  different  service  objects  and  provides  different  application  services.  Management 
module  provides  authentication,  billing,  security  and  other  management  functions  of  the 
cloud computing platform. Service module provides management-related specific businesses 
in  the  university  resource  allocation,  such  as  resource  information  inquiry,  resource  usage 
applying, resource allocation results inquiry, resource management, etc., providing service on 
demand  based  on the  users’  needs.  Data  module is the  storage  of all  the entities  in the  data 
model  and  is  part  of  the  basis  for  management  and  services.  User  layer,  including  teachers 
and students, staffs in the university as well as possible authorized social users, supports users 
in  different  roles  through  mobile  terminals,  personal  computers  and  a  variety  of  ways  to 
access or manage the data in the application layer.

4. Conclusions 

Cloud  computing  is  a  research  hotspot  in  IT  fields,  which  utilizes  virtualization 
technology,  integrates  distributed  computing,  storage,  data,  applications  and  other 
resources,  provides  collaborative  computing  model  and  strong  information  processing 
capabilities.  A  new  idea  which  is  applying  cloud  computing  to  the  resource 
management  in  universities  is  presented  in  this  paper,  for  solving  shortcomings  in  the 
current  inefficiency  resource  management,  lack  of  resource  information  timely 
communication  and  resource  sharing.  At  present  this  model  still  exist  some  imperfect 
places, pending further research, improvement and practice.

Abstract 

The  resource  allocation  is  the  basic  guarantee  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
university development strategy, while resource allocation mechanism is an effective control 
measure to strengthen the university management. So the importance of resource allocation 
has  caused  widespread  attention  and  concern  of  university  administrators.  Combining  with 
the  actual  situations  and  encountered  problems  of  university  resource  management,  we 
introduced  cloud  computing  ideas  and  proposed  a  cloud-computing-based  resource 
allocation  model  to  conduct  a  preliminary  exploration  and  research  on  this  issue.  We  first 
formulated  the  resource  allocation  problem,  and  then  proposed  the  resource  allocation 
concept  model  and  its  corresponding  application  model  in  universities.  Based  on  the 
proposed  model,  we  further  expanded  detailed  analyses  and  descriptions  on  resource 
definition  and  description,  resource  allocation  rules  and  methods,  resource  management 
mode,  and  a  general  mathematical  model  of  resource  allocation  optimization  in  university. 
Finally, we gave a cloud-computing-based university resource allocation framework to offer 
references and consult for further applications of technology based on cloud computing in the 
university  resource  construction,  aiming  to  achieve  optimal  university  resource  allocation 
and improve teaching quality and efficiency.

1. Introduction 

With  the  continuous  development  of  information  technology,  colleges  and  universities 
information technology has become an important part of the university's business, university 
leadership has been more attention with the teachers and students. Resources are the basis for 
development  and  the  essential  guarantee  for  higher  education  quality.  However,  the  actual 
rate  of  growth in  resources  development  of  universities  is far  from  meeting  the demand  for 
resources needed. With the expansion of colleges and universities, will inevitably lead to the 
relative  per  capita  possession  of  resources  reduced.  Obviously,  the  resource  management 
technology  in  university  is  also  facing  the  great  challenges  and  opportunities  with  the 
transition  from  the  traditional  management  techniques  to  the  information  resource 
modernization  and sharing  [1].  Furthermore,  in  recent  years,  the  emerging  cloud  computing 
technology  has  brought  new  opportunities  and  provided  a  new  way  of  thinking  for  the 
development of the resource management technology in university. 

Cloud computing as a new product with the times because of its powerful product features 
in  some  areas  has  been  the  basic  application  of  [2].  Cloud  computing  stores  the  data, 
applications  and  services  in  the  cloud,  takes  full  advantage  of  the  powerful  computation

capabilities of data center, achieves self-adaptability of user business systems. Based on this 
idea,  the  cloud-centric  innovative  applications  continue  to  produce.  We  should  design 
following the concept, i.e. Application as a Service (AaaS), and provide all the resources and 
functions as a service to the cloud clients.  

This  paper  analyses  the  characteristics  and  usage  of  university  resources,  in  accordance 
with the “Fair, Open and Justice” principle, elaborates the resource allocation model and its 
application  based  on  cloud  computing.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, we propose the resource allocation model including concept model and application 
model  that  we  research  in  this  paper,  and  some  definitions  and  descriptions  about  the 
resources  and allocation  procedures  are  given.  Section  3  describes  the  application  of  cloud-
computing-based  resource  allocation  model  in  detail.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  in 
Section 4. 
 
2. Resource Allocation Model 
 
2.1. Problem Formulation 

First, we briefly analyze the resource allocation procedure, as shown in Figure 1. In fact, 
the  resource  allocation  is  the  result  set  of  mappings  from  users  to  resources  in  accordance 
with  certain  rules.  Reasonable  resource  configuration  to  improve  resource  utilization  is  to 
optimize  resource  allocation,  which to  obtain an  optimal  result  set of  mapping  from  user to 
resource according to certain rules. 
 

Figure 1. User-Resource Mappings 

 

The  same  resource  defined  in  the  usual  sense  is  different  from  each  other  because  of  its 
spatial and time such factors. In this way, a vector including spatial property, time property 
and  other  basic  properties  of  the  resource  can  truly  identify  a  valid  resource,  i.e.,  minimal 
resource unit. The resource definition is described in Section 2.4. 
 
2.2. Resource Allocation Concept Model 

The  resource  allocation  concept  model  shown  in  Figure  2  gives  a  uniform  solution  to 
define, explain, supervise and manage throughout the life cycle of the resource allocation and 
usage in universities. 

From  the  perspective  of  above  model,  Resource Manager  is  a function entity  responsible 
for  the  control  and  allocation  of  users  and  resources.  Rule  Service  is  a  function  entity  to 
provide  corresponding  resource  rules  from  the  Rule  Database  which  is  used  to  store 
reservation rules of various types of resources. Authorized Authentication Center is a function 
entity to issue the identity certificate. Users, i.e., organization or individual user, can reserve 
resources only through authorized authentication.

The resource allocation application model in universities is mainly composed of five parts 
according  to  the  function  flow.  To  start  a  round  of  resource  allocation,  first,  each  user  in 
original  group  submits  his  resource  request  to  the  Request  Processor;  second,  the  Request 
Processor put the users’ requests forward to the appropriate Resource Agent according to the 
type  of  resources  users  attend  to  apply  for;  third,  the  Resource  Agent  is  responsible  for 
resource allocation and integration of the results in accordance with these resources’ rules and 
algorithms;  finally,  the  allocation  results  are  returned  to  the  users  in  Result  Group  and  the 
current round of resource allocation ends. The main functions of each part are as follows: 

Request  Processor:  The  request  processor  is  responsible  for  parsing  the  user  requests.  It 
will distribute these requests to the specified resource agent according to certain rules, such as 
resource type, load balancing and so on. Here, the set of resource requests for each user can 

be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set  user 

 applies for, 

. 

Resource Agent: The resource agent is responsible for the management of publishing and 
allocating  resources.  Furthermore,  the  agent  constraints  the  user’s  applying  behavior 
according  to  the  rules  for  each  type  of  resources.  The  users  who  cannot  be  satisfied  with 
requirements for resource usage will not be included in the resource allocation. 

Original group: The original group is the set of all the users applying for resources. Users 

according to their requirements apply for all kinds of resources which are needed. 

Rules/Allocation  Algorithms:  This  function  module  stores  usage  rules  and  allocation 

algorithms for each type of resources. 

Result  Group: After resource allocation ends, the set of resource allocation for each user 

can  be  described  as 

,  where 

 represents  resource  set 

assigned to user 

, 

. 

 
2.4. Resource Description 

This section explicates resource description in detail. 

Definition  1.  Resource  unit  refers  to  the  minimum  allocation  item  of  resources,  which  is 

indivisible. For convenience, we call a resource unit as a resource in this paper. 

Let 

an  m-dimensional 

vector 

express 

a 

resource, 

i.e., 

, 

,  where  m  represents  the  vector  dimension  to  describe  various 
attributes of the resource, such as space, time, category, relations with other resources and so 
on. 

Definition 2. Resource classification tree is a finite set of n nodes. In the set, we define a 

unique relationship, which satisfies the following conditions: 

  Root node is an only node with no parent node in the set. 

 

 

Except root node, each node has one and only a parent node. 

Except root node, any node n has an only node sequence from the root to this node, 
i.e., n0, n1, n2,…, nk, where n0 is the root, nk is the node n and ni is the children node of 
the node ni-1. This node sequence is called a path from the root to n and k is the path 
length.

Each node represents a specific classification in certain kind of resource categories in 
university. 

Leaf  node  is  the  node  with  no  children  nodes,  which  represents  the  minimum 
classified catalogue in the classification tree. 

 

 

Definition 3. The level of the resource classification tree is the maximum path length from 
the root to all nodes, i.e., the root node is at level 0, and the nodes whose parent node is root 
are at level 1, and so on. 

The first level of the tree represents first categories of the university resources, the second 
level of the tree represents second categories of the university resources, and so on, and the nth 
level  of  the  tree  represents  nth  categories  of  the  university  resources.  Each  node  represents 
some sort of a resource, whose parent node represents the upper classification of the current 
node  and  whose  children  nodes  represent  the  sub-classification  of  the  current  node.  We 
encode for each node in accordance with the following rules to generate: 

  According  to  the  experiences  and  statistical  data,  we  determine  the  maximum 
classified number of the nodes with the same parent node under each level of the tree 
and define several digits used to describe them. 

  At  a  certain  level  in  the  tree,  the  nodes  with  the  same  parent  node  are  orderly 

numbered from left to right. 

Then, the category code of any node in the tree can be composed by the description digit 
determined by the tree level and codes of all the nodes in the path. For example, the category 
codes  of  node  A  and  node  B  are  10201201201  and  10299299299  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. An Example of Resource Classification Tree and its Encoding 

 

According to the definition of the resource classification tree, we have established a multi-
layer  resource  classification  tree  to  form  a  university  resource  classification  system, 
facilitating unified maintenance and management of the university resource classification. In 
the  resource  classification  tree  architecture,  the  university  resources  will  be  divided  into 
several  categories,  each  category  is  divided  into  many  subcategories,  and  each  subcategory 
can  be  divided  into  much  smaller  subcategory,  and  so  on.  Thus,  each  category  has  a  class 
number  and  each  kind  of  resources  can  be  assigned  to  a  certain  category.  Assume  that 
category  code  of  any  resource  must  be  described  by  the  leaf  node  of  the  resource 
classification  tree,  through  which  we  can  trace  and  analyze  the  affiliations  and  various 
categories of the resource classification at all levels.

2.5. Resource Management and Allocation 

The  ownership  of  the  university  resources  belongs  to  the  university,  but  university 
administrations  or  units  are  authorized  to  manage  these  resources.  Therefore,  we  build  a 
resource  management  tree  based  on  university  organization  tree  to  analyze  the  resource 
management mode. 

According  to  the  management  and  usage  requirements  of  the  university  resources,  the 

resource allocation rules can be divided into two categories: 

  No  user  participation.  Administrative  departments  or  units  directly  allocate  their 

responsible resources in accordance with the corresponding resource rules. 

  User  participation.  Users  participate  in  the  resource  allocation  procedure,  such  as 
student’s  selecting  courses,  activity  ground  reservations  and  so  on.  Administrative 
departments  or  units  launch  resource  allocation  based  on  the  users’  requirements 
under certain rules. 

No  matter  what  kind  of  allocation  rules,  we  need  to  consider  user  permissions,  usage 

requirements, restrictions and other factors for the use of resources. 

Due  to  various  allocation  methods,  there  are  various  allocation  policies  in  the  rule 
constraints,  such  as  first  come  first  served  basis,  average  allocation,  random  allocation, 
resource  reservation,  etc.,  According  to  the  mathematical  modeling,  we  achieve  fair, 
reasonable  and  multi-win  resource  allocation  using  kinds  of  algorithms,  such  as  heuristic 
algorithm, bionic algorithm, intelligent computing and so on. 
 
2.6. The Mathematical Model of Resource Allocation Optimization 

The resource  allocation issue  can  be  considered  as a multi-constraint and  multi-objective 
programming problem, aiming to optimize the user satisfaction, resource utilization and costs, 
and ensuring to optimize resource allocation for each category at the same time to make all 
resources  allocated  to  achieve  optimization  overall.  Therefore  optimization  of  resource 
allocation  strategy  can  be  an  interesting  and  challenging  task.  A  classical  optimal  resource 
allocation problem can be presented as: 

                                   

                                             (1) 

s.t.

                                                                (3) 

                                                             (4) 

                                    (5) 

where  objective  value  function 

 becomes  minimized  (e.g.,  cost)  or 

maximized  (e.g.,  profit)  through  the  comprehensive  consideration  of  many  factors.  The 
variable  xij  represents  the  amount  of  resources  with  category  j  allocated  to  user  i  and  the

variable  xi  represents  the  amount  of  all  resources  allocated  to  user  i. 

 represents  the 

amount of resources with category j and 

 represents the number of resource categories. In 

the case of cloud computing, the resources are elastic, i.e., 

 and 

 cannot be regarded as 

a static parameter. Therefore, it is an important research task to investigate optimal resource 

allocation algorithms, as presented in [3], but not assuming 

 or 

  as a fixed value. Thus 

online  monitoring  of 

 or 

 is  necessary  to  decide  the  best  time  for  allocation  or 

reallocation towards optimization. 
 
3. The Application of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 
 
3.1. Cloud Computing Overview 

Cloud computing is a development and convergence product of grid computing, distributed 
computing,  virtualization  and  other  computer  technology  and  network  technology  [4,  5].  A 
core concept of cloud computing is that by continuously improving the processing capability 
of  cloud,  thereby  reducing  the  processing  burden  on  the  user  terminal,  the  user  terminals 
eventually  reduced  to  a  simple  input  and  output  devices,  and  can  enjoy  on-demand  the 
powerful computing processing capability of cloud. Cloud computing is a way of computing 
mode to provide dynamic scalable virtual resources using Internet as a service, which can be 
expressed  as  four  kinds  of  deployment  models,  three  kinds  of  service  models  and  seven 
characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.

3.2. The Architecture of Cloud-Computing-Based Resource Allocation Model 

The resource allocation model belongs to SaaS research category, and its cloud computing 
based architecture is shown in Figure 6. The architecture is based on the popular B/S service 
mode, including service terminal devices and cloud computing platform. Users through such 
as  the  mobile  terminal,  personal  computer  or  temporary  offline  on-demand  access  various 
resource  services  provided  by  cloud  computing  platform.  The  cloud  computing  platform  is 
composed of physical layer, virtual layer and application layer.

Physical layer provides computing, network and storage resources to the upper layer in the 
form  of  resource  pools.  Virtual  layer  through  virtualization  management  platform  fully 
integrates and efficiently utilizes computing, network and storage resources. According to the 
function,  application  layer  is  divided  into  management,  service  and  data  modules,  which 
orients  different  service  objects  and  provides  different  application  services.  Management 
module  provides  authentication,  billing,  security  and  other  management  functions  of  the 
cloud computing platform. Service module provides management-related specific businesses 
in  the  university  resource  allocation,  such  as  resource  information  inquiry,  resource  usage 
applying, resource allocation results inquiry, resource management, etc., providing service on 
demand  based  on the  users’  needs.  Data  module is the  storage  of all  the entities  in the  data 
model  and  is  part  of  the  basis  for  management  and  services.  User  layer,  including  teachers 
and students, staffs in the university as well as possible authorized social users, supports users 
in  different  roles  through  mobile  terminals,  personal  computers  and  a  variety  of  ways  to 
access or manage the data in the application layer.

4. Conclusions 

Cloud  computing  is  a  research  hotspot  in  IT  fields,  which  utilizes  virtualization 
technology,  integrates  distributed  computing,  storage,  data,  applications  and  other 
resources,  provides  collaborative  computing  model  and  strong  information  processing 
capabilities.  A  new  idea  which  is  applying  cloud  computing  to  the  resource 
management  in  universities  is  presented  in  this  paper,  for  solving  shortcomings  in  the 
current  inefficiency  resource  management,  lack  of  resource  information  timely 
communication  and  resource  sharing.  At  present  this  model  still  exist  some  imperfect 
places, pending further research, improvement and practice.
