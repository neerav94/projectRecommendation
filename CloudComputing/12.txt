Abstract—  OpenStack  is  a  massively  scalable  open  source  cloud  operating  system  that  is  a  global 
collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud 
computing  platform  for  public  and  private  clouds.  OpenStack  provides  series  of  interrelated  projects 
delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution as well as  controls large pools of storage, 
compute and networking resources throughout a datacenter that all managed through a dashboard(Horizon) 
that  gives  administrators  control  while  empowering  their  users  to  provision  resources  through  a  web 
interface.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of Cloud Computing Platform such as  Eucalyptus, 
Openstack,  CloudStack  and  Opennebula  which  is  open  source  software,  cloud  computing  layered  model, 
components of OpenStack, architecture of OpenStack. Further discussing about how to install Openstack as 
well as how to build virtual machine (VM) in Openstack cloud using CLI on RHEL 6.4 and at last covering 
latest  OpenStack  releases  Icehouse,  which  is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds  and 
introduce  what  new  features  added  in  Icehouse.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  mainly  importance  of 
OpenStack as a Cloud provider and give the best solution for service providers as well as enterprises.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

III.   OPEN SOURCE CLOUD PLATFORM 

 

A.  Eucalyptus 

EUCALYPTUS[3,5] is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Program to 
Useful System,  which is an open source private cloud software for building private or  hybrid cloud  resources 
for  compute,  network,  and  storage  that  are  compatible  with  Amazon  Web  Service  (AWS)  APIs.  It  was 
developed  by  University  of  California-Santa  Barbara  for  Cloud  Computing  to  implement  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS). Eucalyptus [3] provide an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) -compatible cloud Computing Platform 
and Simple Storage Service  (S3)-compatible Cloud Storage. Eucalyptus has some high-level components such 
as Cloud Controller (CLC),  Cluster  Controller (CC), Storage Controller (SC),  and Node  Controller (NC). The 
main  benefits  to  use  this  open  source  software  for  private  clouds  which  provide  highly  efficient,  scalability, 
organization agility. 

B.  OpenStack 

OpenStack  [3,5]  is  the  fastest  growing  free  open  source  software  was  announced  in  July  2010,  but  initial 
contributes are NASA and Rackspace. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) while NASA 
contributed  their  "Nebula"  platform  (code).  OpenStack  open  source  software  is  a  collection  of  open  source 
software  project  that  cloud  computing  technologist  can  use  to  setup  and  run  their  cloud  compute  and  storage 
infrastructure.  OpenStack  mainly  consist  of  three  core  software  project  which  are  OpenStack  Compute

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

written  in  C  language  while  Cloud  Controller  ,  Storage  Controller  and  VMWare  -Broker  are  written  in  Java 
language. OpenStack is written in mainly Python, XML, JavaScript and others languages. CloudStack is written 
in mainly Python and Java language.  OpenNebula used many languages such as C++, Ruby and JAVA. 

F.  Hypervisors 

Hypervisor is a software abstraction of a physical hardware platform that  manages  multiple guest operating 
system (OS) to run concurrently on an only  single physical  machine. Eucalyptus is  manageable  with Xen and 
KVM  hypervisor.  OpenStack  is  compatible  with  KVM,  Xen,  LXC,  QEMU,  UML,  Hyper-V  etc.  hypervisor.   
CloudStack software supports multiple hypervisors, such as Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, VMware, KVM and 
vSphere. OpenNebula, support Xen, VMWare and KVM hypervisor.  

G.  Operating System Support

Abstract—  OpenStack  is  a  massively  scalable  open  source  cloud  operating  system  that  is  a  global 
collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud 
computing  platform  for  public  and  private  clouds.  OpenStack  provides  series  of  interrelated  projects 
delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution as well as  controls large pools of storage, 
compute and networking resources throughout a datacenter that all managed through a dashboard(Horizon) 
that  gives  administrators  control  while  empowering  their  users  to  provision  resources  through  a  web 
interface.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of Cloud Computing Platform such as  Eucalyptus, 
Openstack,  CloudStack  and  Opennebula  which  is  open  source  software,  cloud  computing  layered  model, 
components of OpenStack, architecture of OpenStack. Further discussing about how to install Openstack as 
well as how to build virtual machine (VM) in Openstack cloud using CLI on RHEL 6.4 and at last covering 
latest  OpenStack  releases  Icehouse,  which  is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds  and 
introduce  what  new  features  added  in  Icehouse.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  mainly  importance  of 
OpenStack as a Cloud provider and give the best solution for service providers as well as enterprises.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

III.   OPEN SOURCE CLOUD PLATFORM 

 

A.  Eucalyptus 

EUCALYPTUS[3,5] is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Program to 
Useful System,  which is an open source private cloud software for building private or  hybrid cloud  resources 
for  compute,  network,  and  storage  that  are  compatible  with  Amazon  Web  Service  (AWS)  APIs.  It  was 
developed  by  University  of  California-Santa  Barbara  for  Cloud  Computing  to  implement  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS). Eucalyptus [3] provide an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) -compatible cloud Computing Platform 
and Simple Storage Service  (S3)-compatible Cloud Storage. Eucalyptus has some high-level components such 
as Cloud Controller (CLC),  Cluster  Controller (CC), Storage Controller (SC),  and Node  Controller (NC). The 
main  benefits  to  use  this  open  source  software  for  private  clouds  which  provide  highly  efficient,  scalability, 
organization agility. 

B.  OpenStack 

OpenStack  [3,5]  is  the  fastest  growing  free  open  source  software  was  announced  in  July  2010,  but  initial 
contributes are NASA and Rackspace. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) while NASA 
contributed  their  "Nebula"  platform  (code).  OpenStack  open  source  software  is  a  collection  of  open  source 
software  project  that  cloud  computing  technologist  can  use  to  setup  and  run  their  cloud  compute  and  storage 
infrastructure.  OpenStack  mainly  consist  of  three  core  software  project  which  are  OpenStack  Compute

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

E.  Programming/Scripting Language 

Eucalyptus  contains  mainly  five  component  in  which  Cluster  Controller  and  Node  controller  are  primarily 
written  in  C  language  while  Cloud  Controller  ,  Storage  Controller  and  VMWare  -Broker  are  written  in  Java 
language. OpenStack is written in mainly Python, XML, JavaScript and others languages. CloudStack is written 
in mainly Python and Java language.  OpenNebula used many languages such as C++, Ruby and JAVA. 

F.  Hypervisors 

Hypervisor is a software abstraction of a physical hardware platform that  manages  multiple guest operating 
system (OS) to run concurrently on an only  single physical  machine. Eucalyptus is  manageable  with Xen and 
KVM  hypervisor.  OpenStack  is  compatible  with  KVM,  Xen,  LXC,  QEMU,  UML,  Hyper-V  etc.  hypervisor.   
CloudStack software supports multiple hypervisors, such as Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, VMware, KVM and 
vSphere. OpenNebula, support Xen, VMWare and KVM hypervisor.  

G.  Operating System Support 

Eucalyptus  support  Linux  operating  system,  but  images  of  both  Microsoft  windows  and  Linux.  OpenStack 

CloudStack and OpenNebula support CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL open-SUSE, SLES, and Ubuntu.  

H.  Databases 

Eucalyptus  component  support  PostgreSQL  to  store  their  metadata  and  information.  OpenStack  support 
SQLite3,  MySQL  and  PostgreSQL  database.  CloudStack  support  mainly  MySQL  database.  OpenNebula 
supports SQLite backend in some versions while now it uses MySQL database backend. 

I.  Image Management 

In  Eucalyptus  images  are  managed  by  Euca2ools.  OpenStack  open  source  software  image  service  which  is 
glance,  provides  functionality  for  discovering,  registering  and  retrieving  virtual  machine  (VM)  images. 
CloudStack  is  an  open  source  software  designed  to  deploy,  manage  large  networks  of  virtual  machines,  as  a 
highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. OpenNebula use 
image repository to allow administrator to set images. 

J.  VM Migration 

Eucalyptus  do  not  support  VM  migration,  While  OpenStack,  CloudStack  and  OpenNebula  supports  VM 

migration from one resource to another resource.  

K.  Miscellaneous 

OpenStack Open source software has the largest active population in during the past few months. As well as 

in total, it has the largest population followed by Eucalyptus, CloudStack and OpenNebula. 

L.  Production Readiness 

OpenStack  only  available  through  any  of  the  several  vendor  specific  “stacks”.  CloudStack,  Eucalyptus, 

OpenNebula all are enterprise-ready and direct support from developers. 

M. Source Code 

OpenStack, CloudStack and  OpenNebula are  fully open-source, Apache v2.0, but  Eucalyptus is fully open-

source, GPL v3.0 supports. 

V.  OPENSTACK 

OpenStack [8] is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and 
private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

Fig 2. OpenStack Architecture 

 

Components of OpenStack: 

  Compute (Nova): OpenStack Compute (Nova) is a cloud computing fabric controller, which is used for 
deploying  and  managing  large  numbers  of  virtual  machines  and  other  instances  to  handle  computing 
tasks. 

 

  Object  Storage  (Swift):  OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  is  a  scalable  redundant  storage  system  for 
objects and files. Objects as well as files are written to multiple disk drives spread throughout servers 
in  the  data  center,  OpenStack  software  only  responsible  for  ensuring  data  replication  and  integrity 
across the cluster. 

  Block  Storage  (Cinder):  OpenStack  Block  Storage  (Cinder)  is  a  block  storage  component,  which  is 
more analogous to the traditional notion of a computer being able to access specific locations on a disk 
drive  as  well  as  it  provides  persistent  block-level  storage  devices  for  use  with  OpenStack  compute 
instances.  In  OpenStack,  the  block  storage  system  manages  the  creation,  attaching,  detaching  of  the 
block devices to servers.  
 

  Networking  (Neutron):  OpenStack  Networking  (Neutron)  provides  the  networking  capability  for 

OpenStack and it is a system for managing networks and IP addresses easily, quickly and efficiently. 
 

 

  Dashboard  (Horizon):  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon)  is  the  dashboard  behind  OpenStack  which 
provides administrators and users a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based 
resources. 
 
Identity  Service  (Keystone):  OpenStack  Identity  (Keystone)  provides  identity  services  for  OpenStack 
or  it  is  a  central  directory  of  users  mapped  to  the  OpenStack  services  they  can  access.  It  provides 
multiple  means  of  access,  and  acts  as  a  common  authentication  system  across  the  cloud  operating 
system and can integrate with existing backend directory services like LDAP.  
 
Image  Service  (Glance):  OpenStack  Image  Service  (Glance)  provides  image  services  to  OpenStack, 
discovery, registration and delivery services for disk and server images, it also allows these images to 
be used as templates when deploying new virtual machine instances. 
 

 

  Telemetry (Ceilometer): OpenStack Telemetry Service (Ceilometer) provides telemetry services, which 
allow the cloud to provide billing services to individual users of the cloud, it keeps a verifiable count of 
each user’s system usage of each of the various components of an OpenStack cloud. 
 

  Orchestration (Heat): OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) is a service which allows developers to store the 
requirements  of  a  cloud  application  in  a  file  that  defines  what  resources  are  necessary  for  that 
application.

Abstract—  OpenStack  is  a  massively  scalable  open  source  cloud  operating  system  that  is  a  global 
collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud 
computing  platform  for  public  and  private  clouds.  OpenStack  provides  series  of  interrelated  projects 
delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution as well as  controls large pools of storage, 
compute and networking resources throughout a datacenter that all managed through a dashboard(Horizon) 
that  gives  administrators  control  while  empowering  their  users  to  provision  resources  through  a  web 
interface.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of Cloud Computing Platform such as  Eucalyptus, 
Openstack,  CloudStack  and  Opennebula  which  is  open  source  software,  cloud  computing  layered  model, 
components of OpenStack, architecture of OpenStack. Further discussing about how to install Openstack as 
well as how to build virtual machine (VM) in Openstack cloud using CLI on RHEL 6.4 and at last covering 
latest  OpenStack  releases  Icehouse,  which  is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds  and 
introduce  what  new  features  added  in  Icehouse.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  mainly  importance  of 
OpenStack as a Cloud provider and give the best solution for service providers as well as enterprises.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

III.   OPEN SOURCE CLOUD PLATFORM 

 

A.  Eucalyptus 

EUCALYPTUS[3,5] is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Program to 
Useful System,  which is an open source private cloud software for building private or  hybrid cloud  resources 
for  compute,  network,  and  storage  that  are  compatible  with  Amazon  Web  Service  (AWS)  APIs.  It  was 
developed  by  University  of  California-Santa  Barbara  for  Cloud  Computing  to  implement  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS). Eucalyptus [3] provide an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) -compatible cloud Computing Platform 
and Simple Storage Service  (S3)-compatible Cloud Storage. Eucalyptus has some high-level components such 
as Cloud Controller (CLC),  Cluster  Controller (CC), Storage Controller (SC),  and Node  Controller (NC). The 
main  benefits  to  use  this  open  source  software  for  private  clouds  which  provide  highly  efficient,  scalability, 
organization agility. 

B.  OpenStack 

OpenStack  [3,5]  is  the  fastest  growing  free  open  source  software  was  announced  in  July  2010,  but  initial 
contributes are NASA and Rackspace. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) while NASA 
contributed  their  "Nebula"  platform  (code).  OpenStack  open  source  software  is  a  collection  of  open  source 
software  project  that  cloud  computing  technologist  can  use  to  setup  and  run  their  cloud  compute  and  storage 
infrastructure.  OpenStack  mainly  consist  of  three  core  software  project  which  are  OpenStack  Compute

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

E.  Programming/Scripting Language 

Eucalyptus  contains  mainly  five  component  in  which  Cluster  Controller  and  Node  controller  are  primarily 
written  in  C  language  while  Cloud  Controller  ,  Storage  Controller  and  VMWare  -Broker  are  written  in  Java 
language. OpenStack is written in mainly Python, XML, JavaScript and others languages. CloudStack is written 
in mainly Python and Java language.  OpenNebula used many languages such as C++, Ruby and JAVA. 

F.  Hypervisors 

Hypervisor is a software abstraction of a physical hardware platform that  manages  multiple guest operating 
system (OS) to run concurrently on an only  single physical  machine. Eucalyptus is  manageable  with Xen and 
KVM  hypervisor.  OpenStack  is  compatible  with  KVM,  Xen,  LXC,  QEMU,  UML,  Hyper-V  etc.  hypervisor.   
CloudStack software supports multiple hypervisors, such as Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, VMware, KVM and 
vSphere. OpenNebula, support Xen, VMWare and KVM hypervisor.  

G.  Operating System Support 

Eucalyptus  support  Linux  operating  system,  but  images  of  both  Microsoft  windows  and  Linux.  OpenStack 

CloudStack and OpenNebula support CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL open-SUSE, SLES, and Ubuntu.  

H.  Databases 

Eucalyptus  component  support  PostgreSQL  to  store  their  metadata  and  information.  OpenStack  support 
SQLite3,  MySQL  and  PostgreSQL  database.  CloudStack  support  mainly  MySQL  database.  OpenNebula 
supports SQLite backend in some versions while now it uses MySQL database backend. 

I.  Image Management 

In  Eucalyptus  images  are  managed  by  Euca2ools.  OpenStack  open  source  software  image  service  which  is 
glance,  provides  functionality  for  discovering,  registering  and  retrieving  virtual  machine  (VM)  images. 
CloudStack  is  an  open  source  software  designed  to  deploy,  manage  large  networks  of  virtual  machines,  as  a 
highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. OpenNebula use 
image repository to allow administrator to set images. 

J.  VM Migration 

Eucalyptus  do  not  support  VM  migration,  While  OpenStack,  CloudStack  and  OpenNebula  supports  VM 

migration from one resource to another resource.  

K.  Miscellaneous 

OpenStack Open source software has the largest active population in during the past few months. As well as 

in total, it has the largest population followed by Eucalyptus, CloudStack and OpenNebula. 

L.  Production Readiness 

OpenStack  only  available  through  any  of  the  several  vendor  specific  “stacks”.  CloudStack,  Eucalyptus, 

OpenNebula all are enterprise-ready and direct support from developers. 

M. Source Code 

OpenStack, CloudStack and  OpenNebula are  fully open-source, Apache v2.0, but  Eucalyptus is fully open-

source, GPL v3.0 supports. 

V.  OPENSTACK 

OpenStack [8] is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and 
private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

Fig 2. OpenStack Architecture 

 

Components of OpenStack: 

  Compute (Nova): OpenStack Compute (Nova) is a cloud computing fabric controller, which is used for 
deploying  and  managing  large  numbers  of  virtual  machines  and  other  instances  to  handle  computing 
tasks. 

 

  Object  Storage  (Swift):  OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  is  a  scalable  redundant  storage  system  for 
objects and files. Objects as well as files are written to multiple disk drives spread throughout servers 
in  the  data  center,  OpenStack  software  only  responsible  for  ensuring  data  replication  and  integrity 
across the cluster. 

  Block  Storage  (Cinder):  OpenStack  Block  Storage  (Cinder)  is  a  block  storage  component,  which  is 
more analogous to the traditional notion of a computer being able to access specific locations on a disk 
drive  as  well  as  it  provides  persistent  block-level  storage  devices  for  use  with  OpenStack  compute 
instances.  In  OpenStack,  the  block  storage  system  manages  the  creation,  attaching,  detaching  of  the 
block devices to servers.  
 

  Networking  (Neutron):  OpenStack  Networking  (Neutron)  provides  the  networking  capability  for 

OpenStack and it is a system for managing networks and IP addresses easily, quickly and efficiently. 
 

 

  Dashboard  (Horizon):  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon)  is  the  dashboard  behind  OpenStack  which 
provides administrators and users a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based 
resources. 
 
Identity  Service  (Keystone):  OpenStack  Identity  (Keystone)  provides  identity  services  for  OpenStack 
or  it  is  a  central  directory  of  users  mapped  to  the  OpenStack  services  they  can  access.  It  provides 
multiple  means  of  access,  and  acts  as  a  common  authentication  system  across  the  cloud  operating 
system and can integrate with existing backend directory services like LDAP.  
 
Image  Service  (Glance):  OpenStack  Image  Service  (Glance)  provides  image  services  to  OpenStack, 
discovery, registration and delivery services for disk and server images, it also allows these images to 
be used as templates when deploying new virtual machine instances. 
 

 

  Telemetry (Ceilometer): OpenStack Telemetry Service (Ceilometer) provides telemetry services, which 
allow the cloud to provide billing services to individual users of the cloud, it keeps a verifiable count of 
each user’s system usage of each of the various components of an OpenStack cloud. 
 

  Orchestration (Heat): OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) is a service which allows developers to store the 
requirements  of  a  cloud  application  in  a  file  that  defines  what  resources  are  necessary  for  that 
application.

Abstract—  OpenStack  is  a  massively  scalable  open  source  cloud  operating  system  that  is  a  global 
collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud 
computing  platform  for  public  and  private  clouds.  OpenStack  provides  series  of  interrelated  projects 
delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution as well as  controls large pools of storage, 
compute and networking resources throughout a datacenter that all managed through a dashboard(Horizon) 
that  gives  administrators  control  while  empowering  their  users  to  provision  resources  through  a  web 
interface.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of Cloud Computing Platform such as  Eucalyptus, 
Openstack,  CloudStack  and  Opennebula  which  is  open  source  software,  cloud  computing  layered  model, 
components of OpenStack, architecture of OpenStack. Further discussing about how to install Openstack as 
well as how to build virtual machine (VM) in Openstack cloud using CLI on RHEL 6.4 and at last covering 
latest  OpenStack  releases  Icehouse,  which  is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds  and 
introduce  what  new  features  added  in  Icehouse.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  mainly  importance  of 
OpenStack as a Cloud provider and give the best solution for service providers as well as enterprises. 
 
Keywords— Cloud Computing; Eucalyptus; Icehouse; OpenStack; Open Nebula 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

III.   OPEN SOURCE CLOUD PLATFORM 

 

A.  Eucalyptus 

EUCALYPTUS[3,5] is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Program to 
Useful System,  which is an open source private cloud software for building private or  hybrid cloud  resources 
for  compute,  network,  and  storage  that  are  compatible  with  Amazon  Web  Service  (AWS)  APIs.  It  was 
developed  by  University  of  California-Santa  Barbara  for  Cloud  Computing  to  implement  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS). Eucalyptus [3] provide an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) -compatible cloud Computing Platform 
and Simple Storage Service  (S3)-compatible Cloud Storage. Eucalyptus has some high-level components such 
as Cloud Controller (CLC),  Cluster  Controller (CC), Storage Controller (SC),  and Node  Controller (NC). The 
main  benefits  to  use  this  open  source  software  for  private  clouds  which  provide  highly  efficient,  scalability, 
organization agility. 

B.  OpenStack 

OpenStack  [3,5]  is  the  fastest  growing  free  open  source  software  was  announced  in  July  2010,  but  initial 
contributes are NASA and Rackspace. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) while NASA 
contributed  their  "Nebula"  platform  (code).  OpenStack  open  source  software  is  a  collection  of  open  source 
software  project  that  cloud  computing  technologist  can  use  to  setup  and  run  their  cloud  compute  and  storage 
infrastructure.  OpenStack  mainly  consist  of  three  core  software  project  which  are  OpenStack  Compute

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

E.  Programming/Scripting Language 

Eucalyptus  contains  mainly  five  component  in  which  Cluster  Controller  and  Node  controller  are  primarily 
written  in  C  language  while  Cloud  Controller  ,  Storage  Controller  and  VMWare  -Broker  are  written  in  Java 
language. OpenStack is written in mainly Python, XML, JavaScript and others languages. CloudStack is written 
in mainly Python and Java language.  OpenNebula used many languages such as C++, Ruby and JAVA. 

F.  Hypervisors 

Hypervisor is a software abstraction of a physical hardware platform that  manages  multiple guest operating 
system (OS) to run concurrently on an only  single physical  machine. Eucalyptus is  manageable  with Xen and 
KVM  hypervisor.  OpenStack  is  compatible  with  KVM,  Xen,  LXC,  QEMU,  UML,  Hyper-V  etc.  hypervisor.   
CloudStack software supports multiple hypervisors, such as Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, VMware, KVM and 
vSphere. OpenNebula, support Xen, VMWare and KVM hypervisor.  

G.  Operating System Support 

Eucalyptus  support  Linux  operating  system,  but  images  of  both  Microsoft  windows  and  Linux.  OpenStack 

CloudStack and OpenNebula support CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL open-SUSE, SLES, and Ubuntu.  

H.  Databases 

Eucalyptus  component  support  PostgreSQL  to  store  their  metadata  and  information.  OpenStack  support 
SQLite3,  MySQL  and  PostgreSQL  database.  CloudStack  support  mainly  MySQL  database.  OpenNebula 
supports SQLite backend in some versions while now it uses MySQL database backend. 

I.  Image Management 

In  Eucalyptus  images  are  managed  by  Euca2ools.  OpenStack  open  source  software  image  service  which  is 
glance,  provides  functionality  for  discovering,  registering  and  retrieving  virtual  machine  (VM)  images. 
CloudStack  is  an  open  source  software  designed  to  deploy,  manage  large  networks  of  virtual  machines,  as  a 
highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. OpenNebula use 
image repository to allow administrator to set images. 

J.  VM Migration 

Eucalyptus  do  not  support  VM  migration,  While  OpenStack,  CloudStack  and  OpenNebula  supports  VM 

migration from one resource to another resource.  

K.  Miscellaneous 

OpenStack Open source software has the largest active population in during the past few months. As well as 

in total, it has the largest population followed by Eucalyptus, CloudStack and OpenNebula. 

L.  Production Readiness 

OpenStack  only  available  through  any  of  the  several  vendor  specific  “stacks”.  CloudStack,  Eucalyptus, 

OpenNebula all are enterprise-ready and direct support from developers. 

M. Source Code 

OpenStack, CloudStack and  OpenNebula are  fully open-source, Apache v2.0, but  Eucalyptus is fully open-

source, GPL v3.0 supports. 

V.  OPENSTACK 

OpenStack [8] is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and 
private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

Fig 2. OpenStack Architecture 

 

Components of OpenStack: 

  Compute (Nova): OpenStack Compute (Nova) is a cloud computing fabric controller, which is used for 
deploying  and  managing  large  numbers  of  virtual  machines  and  other  instances  to  handle  computing 
tasks. 

 

  Object  Storage  (Swift):  OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  is  a  scalable  redundant  storage  system  for 
objects and files. Objects as well as files are written to multiple disk drives spread throughout servers 
in  the  data  center,  OpenStack  software  only  responsible  for  ensuring  data  replication  and  integrity 
across the cluster. 

  Block  Storage  (Cinder):  OpenStack  Block  Storage  (Cinder)  is  a  block  storage  component,  which  is 
more analogous to the traditional notion of a computer being able to access specific locations on a disk 
drive  as  well  as  it  provides  persistent  block-level  storage  devices  for  use  with  OpenStack  compute 
instances.  In  OpenStack,  the  block  storage  system  manages  the  creation,  attaching,  detaching  of  the 
block devices to servers.  
 

  Networking  (Neutron):  OpenStack  Networking  (Neutron)  provides  the  networking  capability  for 

OpenStack and it is a system for managing networks and IP addresses easily, quickly and efficiently. 
 

 

  Dashboard  (Horizon):  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon)  is  the  dashboard  behind  OpenStack  which 
provides administrators and users a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based 
resources.

IX. CONCLUSIONS 

In  last  few  years,  cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  technology  as  well  as  it  has  emerged  as  a  modern 
computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and can be used to meet the continuously growing storage 
and  processing  requirements  of  today’s  applications.  Open  Source  Softwares  are  those  software  their  source 
code available to the user with or without fee. The Open source cloud platform is most important which provide 
an  alternative  to  end-user  for  improved  portability,  flexibility,  scalability.  This  paper  compares  the  three  most 
popular and commonly used open source software which are OpenNebula Eucalyptus and OpenStack; these all 
open source software allow users to choose better services according to their requirement. OpenStack is an open 
source software used for designed to allow researchers and administrators to deploy  infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS)  and  provide  tools  for  creating  and  managing  virtual  machines  (VMs)  on  top  of  existing  resources.  
Further research is going on in the new technologies that evaluate its performances in dynamic reconfiguration 
in an IaaS Cloud Computing.

Abstract—  OpenStack  is  a  massively  scalable  open  source  cloud  operating  system  that  is  a  global 
collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud 
computing  platform  for  public  and  private  clouds.  OpenStack  provides  series  of  interrelated  projects 
delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution as well as  controls large pools of storage, 
compute and networking resources throughout a datacenter that all managed through a dashboard(Horizon) 
that  gives  administrators  control  while  empowering  their  users  to  provision  resources  through  a  web 
interface.  In this paper, we present a comparative study of Cloud Computing Platform such as  Eucalyptus, 
Openstack,  CloudStack  and  Opennebula  which  is  open  source  software,  cloud  computing  layered  model, 
components of OpenStack, architecture of OpenStack. Further discussing about how to install Openstack as 
well as how to build virtual machine (VM) in Openstack cloud using CLI on RHEL 6.4 and at last covering 
latest  OpenStack  releases  Icehouse,  which  is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds  and 
introduce  what  new  features  added  in  Icehouse.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  show  mainly  importance  of 
OpenStack as a Cloud provider and give the best solution for service providers as well as enterprises.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud computing is relatively a new concept for which the resources are dynamically extended, virtualized as 
well as provided as a service on the Internet, it also allow providers to give users access to a virtually unlimited 
number of resources i-e Resource Outsourcing[1]. Cloud computing is a quite new concept  that brings together 
all technologies (Web services, virtualization,  service oriented architecture, grid computing, etc.) and business 
models used to deliver IT capabilities (software, platforms, hardware) as a service request, scalable and elastic. 
OpenStack  is  an  industry  initiative  based  on  a  global  collaboration  of  developers  and  cloud  computing 
technologists producing the open standard cloud computing operating system for both public and private clouds. 
OpenStack  was  founded  by  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting  which  is  rapidly  grown  to  be  a  global  software 
community  of  developers  collaborating  on  a  standard  and  massively  scalable  open-source  cloud  operating 
system. OpenStack  mainly consists of three software projects such as OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object 
Storage and OpenStack Image Service. Ninth release of the open source software which is Openstack Icehouse 
is  used  for  building  public,  private,  and  hybrid  clouds,  new  approximately  350  features  are  added  to  support 
software development, managing data.

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing [5] is a modern computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and it is very essential 
requirement for the IT companies. Cloud Computing providing essential service i.e. infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS),  network  as  a  service  (NaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  software  as  a  service  (SaaS).    Cloud 
computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources such as network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be rapidly provisioned 
and  released  with  minimal  management  effort.  Cloud  Clients  Can  access  and  use  the  services  of  cloud 
applications  using  browsers,  mobile  devices,  while  all  the  data  as  well  as  software  is  stored  on  servers  at  a 
remote location, which are also used to perform all the heavy duty processing.  

 
Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  is  the  most  basic  and  important  cloud  service  model  under  which  virtual 
machines, load balancers, raw block storage, firewalls and networking services are provided. In The platform as 
a  service  model,  a  computing  platform  including  APIs,  operating  system,  development  environments, 
programming language execution environment and web server are typically provided. But In the software as a 
service model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud.  

 
Overall, a cloud computing layered model is very important as well as main aims to provide benefits in terms 
of lesser up-front investment in infrastructure during deployment, higher scalability, lower operating costs, ease 
of access through the Web, reduced business risks and maintenance expenses.

III.   OPEN SOURCE CLOUD PLATFORM 

 

A.  Eucalyptus 

EUCALYPTUS[3,5] is the acronym for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Program to 
Useful System,  which is an open source private cloud software for building private or  hybrid cloud  resources 
for  compute,  network,  and  storage  that  are  compatible  with  Amazon  Web  Service  (AWS)  APIs.  It  was 
developed  by  University  of  California-Santa  Barbara  for  Cloud  Computing  to  implement  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS). Eucalyptus [3] provide an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) -compatible cloud Computing Platform 
and Simple Storage Service  (S3)-compatible Cloud Storage. Eucalyptus has some high-level components such 
as Cloud Controller (CLC),  Cluster  Controller (CC), Storage Controller (SC),  and Node  Controller (NC). The 
main  benefits  to  use  this  open  source  software  for  private  clouds  which  provide  highly  efficient,  scalability, 
organization agility. 

B.  OpenStack 

OpenStack  [3,5]  is  the  fastest  growing  free  open  source  software  was  announced  in  July  2010,  but  initial 
contributes are NASA and Rackspace. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) while NASA 
contributed  their  "Nebula"  platform  (code).  OpenStack  open  source  software  is  a  collection  of  open  source 
software  project  that  cloud  computing  technologist  can  use  to  setup  and  run  their  cloud  compute  and  storage 
infrastructure.  OpenStack  mainly  consist  of  three  core  software  project  which  are  OpenStack  Compute

Infrastructure  (Nova),  OpenStack  Object  Storage  Infrastructure  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  Service 
Infrastructure (Glance).  

C.  CloudStack 

CloudStack,[9] initially developed by Cloud.com, it  was purchased by  Citrix then later on released into the 
Apache  Incubator  program.  The  first  stable  version  of  CloudStack  was  released  in  2013  and  in  this  time 
governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack support some commendable 
features  such  as  storage  independent  compute,  new  security  features,  Smooth  Deployment,  Scalability,  Multi 
Hypervisor  support,  Detailed  Documentation  and  Interactive  Web  UI.  CloudStack’s  followed  monolithic 
architecture which posed some challenges one of them being reduced installation flexibility. 

D.  OpenNebula 

OpenNebula  [3,5,10]  was  first  established  as  a  research  project  back  in  2005  by  Ignacio  M.  Liorente  and 
Ruben  S.  Montero,  which  is  used  by  many  enterprises  as  an  open,  flexible  alternative  to  vCloud  on  their 
VMware-based  data  center.  OpenNebula  is  primarily  used  as  a  virtualization  tool  to  manage  virtualized 
infrastructure in the data center, which is usually referred as private cloud and supports hybrid cloud to combine 
local  infrastructure  with  public  cloud-based  infrastructure,  enabling  highly  scalable  hosting  environments. 
OpenNebula  cloud  infrastructure  provide  users  with  an  elastic  platform  for  fast  delivery  and  scalability  of 
services  and  also  support  Public  cloud  by  providing  cloud  interfaces  to  expose  its  functionality  for  virtual 
machine, storage and network management. 

IV.    COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLOUD SOLUTIONS 

The comparative study between Eucalyptus, OpenStack, CloudStack and OpenNebula is based on the study 
of  the  architecture  of  respective  open  source  platform.  Each  Open  source  software  provide  Infrastructure  as  a 
Service (IaaS) to delivers virtualization environment, in real world [5].  

A.  Origin and Community Support 

Eucalyptus Open source software was the originated by research project of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, Department of computer science. Eucalyptus has an important community that contributes to platform 
development  as  well  as  assists  in  finding  and  fixing.  OpenStack  was  initially  developed  by  Rackspace  and 
NASA,  in  summer  2010.  OpenStack  is  led  by  a  powerful  foundation  contains  more  than  850  companies  and 
4500  members and has a broad range of support from major tech industry players, ranging from HP, Dell , IBM, 
RackSpace, NASA, Cisco, NetApp, Nexenta, and dozens of other companies. CloudStack Open source software, 
initially developed by  Cloud.com, it  was purchased by Citrix then later on released into  the Apache Incubator 
program, but in this time  governed by the Apache Software Foundation and supported by Citrix. CloudStack is 
relatively  new  in  the  open  source  IaaS  space,  so  it  lacks  a  large  community  support  base.  OpenNebula  was 
founded initially by European infrastructure grants. Some big company such as Research in Motion, Telefonia, 
China Mobile also contribute to OpenNebula. 

B.  Architecture 

Eucalyptus  architecture  mainly  consists  of  five  important  component  such  as  Cloud  Controller,  Walrus, 
Cluster  Controller,  Node  controller  and  Storage  Controller.  OpenStack  follows  fragmentated,  distributed 
architecture.  OpenStack  consist  of  three  core  software  projects  which  are  OpenStack  Compute  (Nova), 
OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  and  OpenStack  Image  service  (glance).  CloudStack  Open  source  software 
designed for centralized management and massive scalability; it enabling the effective management of numerous 
geographically  distributed  servers  from  a  single  portal  only  and  follow  monolithic  architecture.  OpenNebula 
follow classical cluster -like architecture with a front end and a set of cluster nodes to run the virtual machines 
(VMs). 

C.   Relation with Amazon 

Eucalyptus,  CloudStack,  OpenNebula  have  embraced  amazon  Web  Service-API  Ecosystem.  OpenStack, 
developers  built  powerful  tools  for  manage  their  resources  using  the  native  OpenStack  RESTful  APIs  or 
OpenStack APIs. 

D.  CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION   

Eucalyptus  is  an  open  source  platform  for  develop  private  cloud.  OpenStack  and  CloudStack  is  an  open 
source  platform  for  develop  private  as  well  as  public  cloud.  OpenNebula  is  an  open  source  platform  for 
deploying hybrid cloud, but it also deploys private as well as public cloud.

E.  Programming/Scripting Language 

Eucalyptus  contains  mainly  five  component  in  which  Cluster  Controller  and  Node  controller  are  primarily 
written  in  C  language  while  Cloud  Controller  ,  Storage  Controller  and  VMWare  -Broker  are  written  in  Java 
language. OpenStack is written in mainly Python, XML, JavaScript and others languages. CloudStack is written 
in mainly Python and Java language.  OpenNebula used many languages such as C++, Ruby and JAVA. 

F.  Hypervisors 

Hypervisor is a software abstraction of a physical hardware platform that  manages  multiple guest operating 
system (OS) to run concurrently on an only  single physical  machine. Eucalyptus is  manageable  with Xen and 
KVM  hypervisor.  OpenStack  is  compatible  with  KVM,  Xen,  LXC,  QEMU,  UML,  Hyper-V  etc.  hypervisor.   
CloudStack software supports multiple hypervisors, such as Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, VMware, KVM and 
vSphere. OpenNebula, support Xen, VMWare and KVM hypervisor.  

G.  Operating System Support 

Eucalyptus  support  Linux  operating  system,  but  images  of  both  Microsoft  windows  and  Linux.  OpenStack 

CloudStack and OpenNebula support CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL open-SUSE, SLES, and Ubuntu.  

H.  Databases 

Eucalyptus  component  support  PostgreSQL  to  store  their  metadata  and  information.  OpenStack  support 
SQLite3,  MySQL  and  PostgreSQL  database.  CloudStack  support  mainly  MySQL  database.  OpenNebula 
supports SQLite backend in some versions while now it uses MySQL database backend. 

I.  Image Management 

In  Eucalyptus  images  are  managed  by  Euca2ools.  OpenStack  open  source  software  image  service  which  is 
glance,  provides  functionality  for  discovering,  registering  and  retrieving  virtual  machine  (VM)  images. 
CloudStack  is  an  open  source  software  designed  to  deploy,  manage  large  networks  of  virtual  machines,  as  a 
highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. OpenNebula use 
image repository to allow administrator to set images. 

J.  VM Migration 

Eucalyptus  do  not  support  VM  migration,  While  OpenStack,  CloudStack  and  OpenNebula  supports  VM 

migration from one resource to another resource.  

K.  Miscellaneous 

OpenStack Open source software has the largest active population in during the past few months. As well as 

in total, it has the largest population followed by Eucalyptus, CloudStack and OpenNebula. 

L.  Production Readiness 

OpenStack  only  available  through  any  of  the  several  vendor  specific  “stacks”.  CloudStack,  Eucalyptus, 

OpenNebula all are enterprise-ready and direct support from developers. 

M. Source Code 

OpenStack, CloudStack and  OpenNebula are  fully open-source, Apache v2.0, but  Eucalyptus is fully open-

source, GPL v3.0 supports. 

V.  OPENSTACK 

OpenStack [8] is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and 
private clouds as well as it is a collection of open source software projects which provides an Infrastructure-as-
a-Service  (IaaS)  solution  through  a  set  of  interrelated  services.  In  July  2010  NASA  and  Rackspace  Hosting 
combindly  launched  an  open-source  cloud-software  initiative  which  is  known  as  OpenStack.  OpenStack  [3] 
code came from NASA's Nebula platform and from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. OpenStack, project is an 
open source cloud computing platform which provide the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for 
public as well as private clouds, also it is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Apache 
License.  The  cloud  is  mainly  providing  computing  features  for  end  users  in  a  remote  environment,  where  the 
actual software runs as a service on reliable, scalable servers rather than on each end users computer. OpenStack 
give facilities for deploy virtual machines (VMs) and other instances which handle different tasks for managing 
a  cloud  environment.  It  provides  horizontal  scaling  very  easy,  which  means  that  tasks  which  benefit  from 
running concurrently can easily serve more as well as  less users on the fly by just spinning up more instances[2].

Fig 2. OpenStack Architecture 

 

Components of OpenStack: 

  Compute (Nova): OpenStack Compute (Nova) is a cloud computing fabric controller, which is used for 
deploying  and  managing  large  numbers  of  virtual  machines  and  other  instances  to  handle  computing 
tasks. 

 

  Object  Storage  (Swift):  OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift)  is  a  scalable  redundant  storage  system  for 
objects and files. Objects as well as files are written to multiple disk drives spread throughout servers 
in  the  data  center,  OpenStack  software  only  responsible  for  ensuring  data  replication  and  integrity 
across the cluster. 

  Block  Storage  (Cinder):  OpenStack  Block  Storage  (Cinder)  is  a  block  storage  component,  which  is 
more analogous to the traditional notion of a computer being able to access specific locations on a disk 
drive  as  well  as  it  provides  persistent  block-level  storage  devices  for  use  with  OpenStack  compute 
instances.  In  OpenStack,  the  block  storage  system  manages  the  creation,  attaching,  detaching  of  the 
block devices to servers.  
 

  Networking  (Neutron):  OpenStack  Networking  (Neutron)  provides  the  networking  capability  for 

OpenStack and it is a system for managing networks and IP addresses easily, quickly and efficiently. 
 

 

  Dashboard  (Horizon):  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon)  is  the  dashboard  behind  OpenStack  which 
provides administrators and users a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based 
resources. 
 
Identity  Service  (Keystone):  OpenStack  Identity  (Keystone)  provides  identity  services  for  OpenStack 
or  it  is  a  central  directory  of  users  mapped  to  the  OpenStack  services  they  can  access.  It  provides 
multiple  means  of  access,  and  acts  as  a  common  authentication  system  across  the  cloud  operating 
system and can integrate with existing backend directory services like LDAP.  
 
Image  Service  (Glance):  OpenStack  Image  Service  (Glance)  provides  image  services  to  OpenStack, 
discovery, registration and delivery services for disk and server images, it also allows these images to 
be used as templates when deploying new virtual machine instances. 
 

 

  Telemetry (Ceilometer): OpenStack Telemetry Service (Ceilometer) provides telemetry services, which 
allow the cloud to provide billing services to individual users of the cloud, it keeps a verifiable count of 
each user’s system usage of each of the various components of an OpenStack cloud. 
 

  Orchestration (Heat): OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) is a service which allows developers to store the 
requirements  of  a  cloud  application  in  a  file  that  defines  what  resources  are  necessary  for  that 
application.

VIII.  OPENSTACK ICEHOUSE 

Icehouse  [8]  is  ninth  release  (April  17,  2014)  of  OpenStack  which  is  available  today,  with  new  features 
reflecting  a  community-wide  effort  to  bring  the  voice  of  the  user  into  the  rapidly  maturing  open  source  cloud 
software  platform.  The  Icehouse  release  had  only  1,202  contributors,  as  well  as  32  percent  increase  from  the 
Havana release six  months ago.  In Icehouse approximately  350 new  features and 2,902  bug  fixes  were added. 
During  the  Icehouse  cycle,  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon)  now  supports  16  languages,  and  the 
internationalization team translated nearly 700,000 words. 

New Capabilities in OpenStack Icehouse: 

In  Icehouse  approximately  350  new  most  important  features  added  are  a  new  program,  OpenStack  Database 
Service  (Trove),  which  was  incubated  during  the  Havana  release  cycle  and  is  now  available  in  the  Icehouse 
release  also.  Programs  in  incubation  also  include  OpenStack  Bare  Metal  (Ironic),  OpenStack  Messaging 
(Marconi) and OpenStack Data Processing (Sahara) which is most important features. 
 

  OpenStack Compute (Nova):  In Icehouse  support for rolling  upgrades  minimizes the impact to running 
workloads during the upgrade process and also improved boot process reliability across platform services. 

 

  OpenStack  Object  Storage  (Swift):  In  Icehouse  include  a  new  feature  which  is  discoverability,  which 
dramatically improves workflows as well as saves time by allowing users to ask any Object Storage cloud 
what capabilities are available via API call. 

 

  OpenStack  Block  Storage  (Cinder):  In  Icehouse  includes  Mandatory  testing  for  external  drivers  now 
ensures  a  consistent  user  experience  across  storage  platforms,  and  fully  distributed  services  improve 
scalability. 

 

  OpenStack  Networking  (Neutron):  In  Icehouse  handle  better  functional  testing  for  actions  that  require 
coordination  between  multiple  services  and  third-party  driver  testing  ensure  consistency  and  reliability 
across network implementations. 

 

  OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone): In Icehouse manage First iteration of federated authentication is 

now supported allowing users to access private and public OpenStack clouds with the same credentials. 

 

  OpenStack  Orchestration  (Heat):  In  Icehouse  provides  automated  scaling  of  additional  resources  across 

the platform, including compute, storage and networking. 

 

  OpenStack  Telemetry  (Ceilometer):  In  Icehouse  support  access  to  metering  data  used  for  automated 

actions or billing / chargeback purposes. 

 

  OpenStack  Dashboard  (Horizon):  In  Icehouse  the  Dashboard  is  now  available  in  16  languages,  such  as 

German, Serbian and also Hindi added during this release cycle. 

 

  OpenStack  Database  Service  (Trove):  In  Icehouse  a  new  capability  included  in  the  integrated  release 

allows users to manage relational database services in an OpenStack environment easily. 

IX. CONCLUSIONS 

In  last  few  years,  cloud  computing  is  an  evolving  technology  as  well  as  it  has  emerged  as  a  modern 
computing paradigm that providing IT infrastructure and can be used to meet the continuously growing storage 
and  processing  requirements  of  today’s  applications.  Open  Source  Softwares  are  those  software  their  source 
code available to the user with or without fee. The Open source cloud platform is most important which provide 
an  alternative  to  end-user  for  improved  portability,  flexibility,  scalability.  This  paper  compares  the  three  most 
popular and commonly used open source software which are OpenNebula Eucalyptus and OpenStack; these all 
open source software allow users to choose better services according to their requirement. OpenStack is an open 
source software used for designed to allow researchers and administrators to deploy  infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS)  and  provide  tools  for  creating  and  managing  virtual  machines  (VMs)  on  top  of  existing  resources.  
Further research is going on in the new technologies that evaluate its performances in dynamic reconfiguration 
in an IaaS Cloud Computing.
