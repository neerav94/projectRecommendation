Abstract 

 

 

This paper explains the design of the AFT_CCE (an Adaptive Fault Tolerance running on 
a  Cloud  Computing  Environment).  The  cloud  computing  environment  distributes  IT 
(Information  Technology)  resources  and  allocates  according  to  user's  request,  so  there 
should  be  a  study  on  technology  that  manages  these  resources  effectively.  An  example  of 
ubiquitous applications based on a cloud computing environment is a multimedia education 
system.  Since  ubiquitous  applications  based  on  a  cloud  computing  environment  need 
situation-aware  middleware  services  and  computing  environment  (e.g.,  resources)  keeps 
changing  as  the  applications  change,  it is  challenging  to  detect errors  and  recover  them  in 
order to provide seamless services and avoid a single point of failure for a cloud computing 
environment.

1. Introduction 

In cloud computing, a user lends IT resources (software, storage, server, network) as 
needed, uses them, gets a support of real-time scalability according to service load, and 
pays  as  he/she  goes.  Especially  the  cloud  computing  environment  distri butes  IT 
resources  and  allocates  according  to  user's  request,  so  there  should  be  a  study  on 
technology that manages these resources effectively [1].  Context awareness (or context 
sensitivity)  is  an  application  software  system’s  ability  to  sense  and  analyze   context 
from  various  sources;  it  lets  application  software  take  different  actions  adaptively  in 
different  contexts  [2].  In  a  ubiquitous  computing  environment,  computing  anytime, 
anywhere,  any  devices,  the  concept  of  situation-aware  middleware  has  played  very 
important  roles  in  matching  user  needs  with  available  computing  resources  in 
transparent  manner 
[3,  4].  The  development  of 
communication  and  data  networks  enables  collaborative  systems  to  support  diverse 
activities  such  as  crisis  management,  cross-continental  conferencing,  and  distributed 
learning.  Moreover,  multimedia  is  deployed  in  collaboration  to  enhance  usability  and 
productivity. For example, in addition to the text and  graphics information in text -chat 
and whiteboard, stream-based media such as audio and video are widely used [5].

This  research  is  about  a  platform  developed  for  the  research  of  AFT_CCE  (an  Adaptive 
Fault Tolerance running on a Cloud Computing Environment) based on situation-awareness.

3.  An  Adaptive  Fault  Detection  and  Recovery  System  running  on  a  Cloud 
Computing Environment: AFT_CCE 

This paper describes AFT_CCE. It is a fault-tolerant system for multimedia collaboration 
agent  such  as  DooRae  is  an  example  of  multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on 
AFT_CCE.  It  has  been  implemented  for  construction  and  experiment  of  effective  DooRae 
environment. 
 
3.1. Hardware as a Service: RCSM 

Ubiquitous  applications  require  use  of  various  contexts  to  adaptively  communicate  with 
each other across multiple network environments, such as mobile ad hoc networks, Internet, 
and  mobile  phone  networks.  However,  existing  context-aware  techniques  often  become 
inadequate in these applications where combinations of multiple contexts and users’ actions 
need  to  be  analyzed  over  a  period  of  time.  Situation-awareness  in  application  software  is 
considered as a desirable property to overcome this limitation. In addition to being context-
sensitive, situation-aware applications can respond to both current and historical relationships 
of  specific  contexts  and  device-actions.  All  of  RCSM’s  components  are  layered  inside  a 
device,  as  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  Object  Request  Broker  of  RCSM  (R-ORB)  assumes  the 
availability of reliable transport protocols; one R-ORB per device is sufficient. The number of 
ADaptive  object  Containers  (ADC)s  depends  on  the  number  of  context-sensitive  objects  in 
the device. ADCs periodically collect the necessary “raw context data” through the R-ORB, 
which  in  turn  collects  the  data  from  sensors  and  the  operating  system.  Initially,  each  ADC 
registers with the R-ORB to express its needs for contexts and to publish the corresponding 
context-sensitive  interface.  RCSM  is  called  reconfigurable  because  it  allows  addition  or 
deletion  of  individual  ADCs  during  runtime  (to  manage  new  or  existing  context-sensitive 
application objects) without affecting other runtime operations inside RCSM. However, it did 
not include fault-tolerance support in the architecture. In this paper, we propose a new fault-
tolerance  capability,  called  “AFT_CCE  (an  Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud 
Computing Environment) in situation-aware middleware. 

 

3.2   Other Services of RCSM: Multimedia Collaboration Agent 

As  shown  in  Figure  3,  multimedia  collaboration  agent  includes  many  agents.  They  are 
AMA(Application  Management  Agent),  IA(Intelligent  Agent),  SMA(Session  Management 
Agent),  ACA(Access  Control  Agent)  and  MCA(Media  Control  Agent),  AFT_CCE(an 
Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud  Computing  Environment).  AMA  consists  of 
various  subclass  modules.  It  includes  creation/deletion  of  shared  video  window  and 
creation/deletion  of  shared  window  For  providing  heterogeneous  platforms  with 
interoperability, it is  necessary to  share media data and to furnish awareness to the remote 
users involved in   collaborative work.

from  various  sources;  it  lets  application  software  take  different  actions  adaptively  in 
different  contexts  [2].  In  a  ubiquitous  computing  environment,  computing  anytime, 
anywhere,  any  devices,  the  concept  of  situation-aware  middleware  has  played  very 
important  roles  in  matching  user  needs  with  available  computing  resources  in 
transparent  manner 
[3,  4].  The  development  of 
communication  and  data  networks  enables  collaborative  systems  to  support  diverse 
activities  such  as  crisis  management,  cross-continental  conferencing,  and  distributed 
learning.  Moreover,  multimedia  is  deployed  in  collaboration  to  enhance  usability  and 
productivity. For example, in addition to the text and  graphics information in text -chat 
and whiteboard, stream-based media such as audio and video are widely used [5].

A  conceptual  architecture  of  situation-aware  middleware  based  on  Reconfigurable 
Context-Sensitive Middleware (RCSM) is proposed in [8]. However, RCSM did not include 
services for cloud computing, other services, and error control support in the architecture. In 
this paper, we propose a new error control mechanism running on situation-aware middleware

3.  An  Adaptive  Fault  Detection  and  Recovery  System  running  on  a  Cloud 
Computing Environment: AFT_CCE 

This paper describes AFT_CCE. It is a fault-tolerant system for multimedia collaboration 
agent  such  as  DooRae  is  an  example  of  multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on 
AFT_CCE.  It  has  been  implemented  for  construction  and  experiment  of  effective  DooRae 
environment. 
 
3.1. Hardware as a Service: RCSM 

Ubiquitous  applications  require  use  of  various  contexts  to  adaptively  communicate  with 
each other across multiple network environments, such as mobile ad hoc networks, Internet, 
and  mobile  phone  networks.  However,  existing  context-aware  techniques  often  become 
inadequate in these applications where combinations of multiple contexts and users’ actions 
need  to  be  analyzed  over  a  period  of  time.  Situation-awareness  in  application  software  is 
considered as a desirable property to overcome this limitation. In addition to being context-
sensitive, situation-aware applications can respond to both current and historical relationships 
of  specific  contexts  and  device-actions.  All  of  RCSM’s  components  are  layered  inside  a 
device,  as  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  Object  Request  Broker  of  RCSM  (R-ORB)  assumes  the 
availability of reliable transport protocols; one R-ORB per device is sufficient. The number of 
ADaptive  object  Containers  (ADC)s  depends  on  the  number  of  context-sensitive  objects  in 
the device. ADCs periodically collect the necessary “raw context data” through the R-ORB, 
which  in  turn  collects  the  data  from  sensors  and  the  operating  system.  Initially,  each  ADC 
registers with the R-ORB to express its needs for contexts and to publish the corresponding 
context-sensitive  interface.  RCSM  is  called  reconfigurable  because  it  allows  addition  or 
deletion  of  individual  ADCs  during  runtime  (to  manage  new  or  existing  context-sensitive 
application objects) without affecting other runtime operations inside RCSM. However, it did 
not include fault-tolerance support in the architecture. In this paper, we propose a new fault-
tolerance  capability,  called  “AFT_CCE  (an  Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud 
Computing Environment) in situation-aware middleware. 

 

3.2   Other Services of RCSM: Multimedia Collaboration Agent 

As  shown  in  Figure  3,  multimedia  collaboration  agent  includes  many  agents.  They  are 
AMA(Application  Management  Agent),  IA(Intelligent  Agent),  SMA(Session  Management 
Agent),  ACA(Access  Control  Agent)  and  MCA(Media  Control  Agent),  AFT_CCE(an 
Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud  Computing  Environment).  AMA  consists  of 
various  subclass  modules.  It  includes  creation/deletion  of  shared  video  window  and 
creation/deletion  of  shared  window  For  providing  heterogeneous  platforms  with 
interoperability, it is  necessary to  share media data and to furnish awareness to the remote 
users involved in   collaborative work.

4. Simulation Results and Conclusion 
   AFT_CCE is a system which is suitable for detecting and recovering software error running 
on  situation-aware  computing  environment  for  a  cloud  computing  environment  by  using 
software  techniques.  The  purpose  of  AFT_CCE  is  to  recover  application  software  of 
multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
automatically  and  repeatedly.  All  application  software  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud 
computing environment returns to a healthy state or at least an acceptable state.  
As seen by Table 1, RCSM did not include services for cloud computing, other services, and 
error  control  support  in  the  architecture.  In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  new  error  control 
mechanism running on RCSM for a cloud computing environment. 

Multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
integrates multimedia environment with its system and provides real time prompt interaction 
among  users  during  data  flow.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  maintain  and  recover  for 
multimedia  collaboration  agent’s  session  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing 
environment.  This  fault-tolerant  system  was  designed  and  implemented  on  multimedia 
collaboration  agent  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing  environment.  That  is,  the 
purpose  of  this  research  is  for  the  establishment  of  a  real-time  multimedia  collaborative 
distributed  education  environment  through  multimedia  collaboration  agent  environment 
running on the situation-aware computing environment. It is designed and implemented as a 
collaborative multimedia application crafting environment in the Ethernet or ATM.

A  conceptual  architecture  of  situation-aware  middleware  based  on  Reconfigurable 
Context-Sensitive Middleware (RCSM) is proposed in [8]. However, RCSM did not include 
services for cloud computing, other services, and error control support in the architecture. In 
this paper, we propose a new error control mechanism running on situation-aware middleware 
for cloud computing.

Computing Environment: AFT_CCE 

This paper describes AFT_CCE. It is a fault-tolerant system for multimedia collaboration 
agent  such  as  DooRae  is  an  example  of  multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on 
AFT_CCE.  It  has  been  implemented  for  construction  and  experiment  of  effective  DooRae 
environment. 
 
3.1. Hardware as a Service: RCSM 

Ubiquitous  applications  require  use  of  various  contexts  to  adaptively  communicate  with 
each other across multiple network environments, such as mobile ad hoc networks, Internet, 
and  mobile  phone  networks.  However,  existing  context-aware  techniques  often  become 
inadequate in these applications where combinations of multiple contexts and users’ actions 
need  to  be  analyzed  over  a  period  of  time.  Situation-awareness  in  application  software  is 
considered as a desirable property to overcome this limitation. In addition to being context-
sensitive, situation-aware applications can respond to both current and historical relationships 
of  specific  contexts  and  device-actions.  All  of  RCSM’s  components  are  layered  inside  a 
device,  as  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  Object  Request  Broker  of  RCSM  (R-ORB)  assumes  the 
availability of reliable transport protocols; one R-ORB per device is sufficient. The number of 
ADaptive  object  Containers  (ADC)s  depends  on  the  number  of  context-sensitive  objects  in 
the device. ADCs periodically collect the necessary “raw context data” through the R-ORB, 
which  in  turn  collects  the  data  from  sensors  and  the  operating  system.  Initially,  each  ADC 
registers with the R-ORB to express its needs for contexts and to publish the corresponding 
context-sensitive  interface.  RCSM  is  called  reconfigurable  because  it  allows  addition  or 
deletion  of  individual  ADCs  during  runtime  (to  manage  new  or  existing  context-sensitive 
application objects) without affecting other runtime operations inside RCSM. However, it did 
not include fault-tolerance support in the architecture. In this paper, we propose a new fault-
tolerance  capability,  called  “AFT_CCE  (an  Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud 
Computing Environment) in situation-aware middleware.

As  shown  in  Figure  3,  multimedia  collaboration  agent  includes  many  agents.  They  are 
AMA(Application  Management  Agent),  IA(Intelligent  Agent),  SMA(Session  Management 
Agent),  ACA(Access  Control  Agent)  and  MCA(Media  Control  Agent),  AFT_CCE(an 
Adaptive  Fault  Tolerance  running  on  a  Cloud  Computing  Environment).  AMA  consists  of 
various  subclass  modules.  It  includes  creation/deletion  of  shared  video  window  and 
creation/deletion  of  shared  window  For  providing  heterogeneous  platforms  with 
interoperability, it is  necessary to  share media data and to furnish awareness to the remote 
users involved in   collaborative work.

As shown in Figure 4, you can see the message flows in relationship between AFT_CCE 

and the application software. It consists of a user, AFT_CCE and the watched application

Environment 

 
At times during the process of multimedia collaboration agent’s session running on RCSM 
for  a  cloud  computing  environment,  there  may  occur  abnormal  session  endings,  such  as  on 
media service instance. In this case, it is necessary to protect users from error by reactivating 
the media service. We are first in need of a method to detect error for the session’s recovery. 
One  of  the  methods  to  detect  error  for  session’s  recovery  inspects  process  database 
periodically  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment.  But  this  method  has  a 
weak  point  of  inspecting  all  process  without  regard  to  multimedia  collaboration  agent’s

session. Therefore, we propose AFT_CCE. This method detects error by polling periodically 
the process with relation to multimedia collaboration agent’s session. As shown in Figure 6, 
AFT_CCE can create the sequences below in case of decision to be restored.

4. Simulation Results and Conclusion 
   AFT_CCE is a system which is suitable for detecting and recovering software error running 
on  situation-aware  computing  environment  for  a  cloud  computing  environment  by  using 
software  techniques.  The  purpose  of  AFT_CCE  is  to  recover  application  software  of 
multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
automatically  and  repeatedly.  All  application  software  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud 
computing environment returns to a healthy state or at least an acceptable state.  
As seen by Table 1, RCSM did not include services for cloud computing, other services, and 
error  control  support  in  the  architecture.  In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  new  error  control 
mechanism running on RCSM for a cloud computing environment. 

Multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
integrates multimedia environment with its system and provides real time prompt interaction 
among  users  during  data  flow.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  maintain  and  recover  for 
multimedia  collaboration  agent’s  session  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing 
environment.  This  fault-tolerant  system  was  designed  and  implemented  on  multimedia 
collaboration  agent  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing  environment.  That  is,  the 
purpose  of  this  research  is  for  the  establishment  of  a  real-time  multimedia  collaborative 
distributed  education  environment  through  multimedia  collaboration  agent  environment 
running on the situation-aware computing environment. It is designed and implemented as a 
collaborative multimedia application crafting environment in the Ethernet or ATM.

This  paper  proposes  an  reliable  collaboration  system  in  situation-aware  middleware 
framework  such  as  home  network  environment  and  presents  its  simulation  model  of  agent-
based.  It  provides  several  error  detection  and  recovery  functions  and  features  capable  of 
developing  multimedia  distant  system  among  users  during  data  flow.    It  is  a  system  that  is 
suitable  for  detecting  and  recovering  software  error  based  on  multimedia  collaboration 
environment  by  using  software  techniques.  There  are  several  constraints  which  must  be 
satisfied to provide guarantees during multimedia transmission. They are time, space, device, 
frequency, and reliability constraints. We proposed a method for increasing reliability through 
an  adaptive  reliable  QoS  for  resource  errors  model  for  ubiquitous  computing  environments 
such  as  home  network  system.  The  model  for  smart  home  network  system  aims  at 
guaranteeing  it  through  application  QoS.  QoS  for  smart  home  network  system  guarantees 
must  be  met  in  the  application,  system  and  network  to  get  the  acceptance  of  the  users  of 
multimedia communication system.  

Our  future  works  are  QoS-aware  middleware  of  ubiquitous  and  heterogeneous 

environments for smart home network system.

Abstract 

 

 

This paper explains the design of the AFT_CCE (an Adaptive Fault Tolerance running on 
a  Cloud  Computing  Environment).  The  cloud  computing  environment  distributes  IT 
(Information  Technology)  resources  and  allocates  according  to  user's  request,  so  there 
should  be  a  study  on  technology  that  manages  these  resources  effectively.  An  example  of 
ubiquitous applications based on a cloud computing environment is a multimedia education 
system.  Since  ubiquitous  applications  based  on  a  cloud  computing  environment  need 
situation-aware  middleware  services  and  computing  environment  (e.g.,  resources)  keeps 
changing  as  the  applications  change,  it is  challenging  to  detect errors  and  recover  them  in 
order to provide seamless services and avoid a single point of failure for a cloud computing 
environment.

1. Introduction 

In cloud computing, a user lends IT resources (software, storage, server, network) as 
needed, uses them, gets a support of real-time scalability according to service load, and 
pays  as  he/she  goes.  Especially  the  cloud  computing  environment  distri butes  IT 
resources  and  allocates  according  to  user's  request,  so  there  should  be  a  study  on 
technology that manages these resources effectively [1].  Context awareness (or context 
sensitivity)  is  an  application  software  system’s  ability  to  sense  and  analyze   context 
from  various  sources;  it  lets  application  software  take  different  actions  adaptively  in 
different  contexts  [2].  In  a  ubiquitous  computing  environment,  computing  anytime, 
anywhere,  any  devices,  the  concept  of  situation-aware  middleware  has  played  very 
important  roles  in  matching  user  needs  with  available  computing  resources  in 
transparent  manner 
[3,  4].  The  development  of 
communication  and  data  networks  enables  collaborative  systems  to  support  diverse 
activities  such  as  crisis  management,  cross-continental  conferencing,  and  distributed 
learning.  Moreover,  multimedia  is  deployed  in  collaboration  to  enhance  usability  and 
productivity. For example, in addition to the text and  graphics information in text -chat 
and whiteboard, stream-based media such as audio and video are widely used [5].

Environment 

 
At times during the process of multimedia collaboration agent’s session running on RCSM 
for  a  cloud  computing  environment,  there  may  occur  abnormal  session  endings,  such  as  on 
media service instance. In this case, it is necessary to protect users from error by reactivating 
the media service. We are first in need of a method to detect error for the session’s recovery. 
One  of  the  methods  to  detect  error  for  session’s  recovery  inspects  process  database 
periodically  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment.  But  this  method  has  a 
weak  point  of  inspecting  all  process  without  regard  to  multimedia  collaboration  agent’s

session. Therefore, we propose AFT_CCE. This method detects error by polling periodically 
the process with relation to multimedia collaboration agent’s session. As shown in Figure 6, 
AFT_CCE can create the sequences below in case of decision to be restored.

4. Simulation Results and Conclusion 
   AFT_CCE is a system which is suitable for detecting and recovering software error running 
on  situation-aware  computing  environment  for  a  cloud  computing  environment  by  using 
software  techniques.  The  purpose  of  AFT_CCE  is  to  recover  application  software  of 
multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
automatically  and  repeatedly.  All  application  software  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud 
computing environment returns to a healthy state or at least an acceptable state.  
As seen by Table 1, RCSM did not include services for cloud computing, other services, and 
error  control  support  in  the  architecture.  In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  new  error  control 
mechanism running on RCSM for a cloud computing environment. 

Multimedia  collaboration  agent  running  on  RCSM  for  a  cloud  computing  environment 
integrates multimedia environment with its system and provides real time prompt interaction 
among  users  during  data  flow.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  maintain  and  recover  for 
multimedia  collaboration  agent’s  session  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing 
environment.  This  fault-tolerant  system  was  designed  and  implemented  on  multimedia 
collaboration  agent  running  on  the  situation-aware  computing  environment.  That  is,  the 
purpose  of  this  research  is  for  the  establishment  of  a  real-time  multimedia  collaborative 
distributed  education  environment  through  multimedia  collaboration  agent  environment 
running on the situation-aware computing environment. It is designed and implemented as a 
collaborative multimedia application crafting environment in the Ethernet or ATM.

This  paper  proposes  an  reliable  collaboration  system  in  situation-aware  middleware 
framework  such  as  home  network  environment  and  presents  its  simulation  model  of  agent-
based.  It  provides  several  error  detection  and  recovery  functions  and  features  capable  of 
developing  multimedia  distant  system  among  users  during  data  flow.    It  is  a  system  that  is 
suitable  for  detecting  and  recovering  software  error  based  on  multimedia  collaboration 
environment  by  using  software  techniques.  There  are  several  constraints  which  must  be 
satisfied to provide guarantees during multimedia transmission. They are time, space, device, 
frequency, and reliability constraints. We proposed a method for increasing reliability through 
an  adaptive  reliable  QoS  for  resource  errors  model  for  ubiquitous  computing  environments 
such  as  home  network  system.  The  model  for  smart  home  network  system  aims  at 
guaranteeing  it  through  application  QoS.  QoS  for  smart  home  network  system  guarantees 
must  be  met  in  the  application,  system  and  network  to  get  the  acceptance  of  the  users  of 
multimedia communication system.  

Our  future  works  are  QoS-aware  middleware  of  ubiquitous  and  heterogeneous 

environments for smart home network system.
