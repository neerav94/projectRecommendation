Abstract— SaaS (Software as a service) is one of the main service provided by cloud computing it has a feature of multi tenancy 
that virtually provides the services on one by one basis but physically all user utilize the services at same time.  It has received 
considerable attention  in  past  few years  and  an  increasing  number  of  countries  show  their  interest  in the  promotion  of  SaaS 
market. Although it has received significant attention but security issue is one of the major inhibitor in decreasing the growth of 
SaaS. Many organizations may still be hesitant to introduce SaaS mainly because of the trust and security concerns, they may 
observe more risks than benefits in introducing this service. In this study an attempt is made to discuss the security issues and 
their existing solutions in SaaS delivery model of cloud computing.

technologies [2]. 
 
According  to  NIST  [1]  and  Seccombe  [3],  guidelines  for  cloud  computing,  it  has  four  different  deployment  models;  (a)  private 
cloud,  it  may  be  owned,  managed  and  operated  by  the  organization,  a third  party  or  some  combination  of  them.  (b)  Community 
cloud, it may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community. (c) Public cloud, the cloud 
infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed and operated by business, academic, or 
government  organization.  (d)  Hybrid  cloud,  the  cloud  infrastructure  is  composition  of  two  or  more  distinct  cloud  infrastructures. 
There are three different delivery models that are utilized within a particular deployment model. These delivery models are; (a) SaaS 
(Software as a Service), it enables the user to access online applications and software that are hosted by the service providers. (b) 
PaaS  (Platform  as  a  Service),  it  provides  platform  for  developing  applications  by  using  different  programming  languages(c)IaaS

SaaS  is  a  software  deployment  model  where  applications  are  remotely  hosted  by  the  application  or  service  provider  and  made 
available  to  customers  on  demand,  over  the  Internet.  The  SaaS  model  offers  the  customers  with  considerable  benefits,  such  as 
improved operational efficiency and reduced costs. SaaS is rapidly emerging as the dominant delivery model for meeting the needs 
of enterprise IT services. However, most enterprises are still uncomfortable with the SaaS model due to lack of visibility about the 
way their data is stored and secured. 
 
The  global  SaaS market  is  expected  to reach  12.1  billion USD  by  2014, reflecting a  compound  annual  growth rate  of  26%. This 
rapid growth of the SaaS market has had considerable influence on the software market [5, 6].  SaaS is an outsourcing innovation 
that transforms IT resources into continuously provided services [7]. This unique feature of SaaS has allowed the SaaS market to 
grow six times faster than the packaged software market and is expected to facilitate further development of SaaS [8].  However, 
despite of rapid growth of SaaS, it suffers with lot of security concerns. According to [5] new SaaS market, inducing SaaS adoption 
is likely to be difficult due to major inhibitors, such as limited integration and flexibility. 
 
Our main area of concern in this paper is  to highlight  security issues and their existing solutions in SaaS model. This best-known 
branch  of  cloud  computing  represents  a  delivery  model  in  which  applications  are  hosted  and  supervised  in  a  service  provider's 
datacenter. The paper illustrates the assorted security issues of cloud computing with respect to SaaS service delivery model.

II.  SECURITY ISSUES IN SaaS 

 
Many vendors declared that adoption of SaaS technology can bring out many benefits to the users such as cost reduction, yet some 
organization  are  still not  feeling  comfortable  in  adoption  of  SaaS  due  mainly  to  trust  concern  e.g, data  security  [9,10].  The  trust 
issue  is  needed  to  be  improved  to  get  the  users  attraction.  SaaS  is  encouraging  solution  in  expanding  the  organization’s  IT 
performance but many organizations still avoid in adoption of this technology because of lack of trust [11]. Most of the companies 
that have critical data wanted to self-support their own architecture or keep the data at their site or wanted to modify the software at 
their choosing but SaaS is not flexible to meet their needs.  
 
The removal of data from service provider end is also a threatening issue. Hayes raises a point that there is no way to know  that the 
cloud computing service providers properly deleted the client removed data or they saved it for some unknown reasons [12].In SaaS 
environment user do not know that where the data is exactly stores, cloud computing moves databases and application software’s to 
large data centers where the management of services are not reliable. This sole aspect poses many new security challenges [13]. In 
SaaS environment provider must ensure that the multiple users don’t get to see each other’s data. So, it becomes important to the 
user to ensure that right security measures are in place and also difficult to get an assurance that the application will be available 
when needed [14]. 
                           
In the SaaS model, user data is stored at the SaaS provider’s data center, along with the data of other users. If the SaaS provider is 
dealing  with  public  cloud  computing  service,  the  enterprise  data  might  be  stored  along  with  the  data  of  other  unrelated  SaaS 
applications.  The  cloud  provider  might,  additionally,  replicate  the  data  at  multiple  locations  across  countries  for  the  purposes  of 
maintaining high availability. There is a great deal of anxiety with the lack of control and awareness of how user’s data is stored and 
secured in the SaaS model.  
 
The  key  security  rudiments  should  be  carefully  considered  as  a  fundamental  part  of  the  SaaS  application  development  and 
deployment  process  include;  Data  security,  Network  security,  Data  locality,  Data  integrity,  Data  segregation,  Data  access, 
Authentication  and  authorization,  Data  confidentiality,  Web  application  security,  Data  breaches,  Virtualization,  Availability, 
Backup  and  Identity  management  [10].  Fig  2  indicates  some  important  security  issues  in  SaaS  delivery  model.  Some  of  the 
important security challenges are described below.

2.1 Data Security 
 
Data security is one of the leading and most cited issue in SaaS delivery model. Data security may be a major concern for users who 
wants to introduce cloud computing. This technology needs proper security principles and mechanisms to eliminate users concerns. 
For example, most cloud services users have concerns about their private data that it may be used for other purposes or sent to other 
cloud  service  providers  [15].  The  user  data  that  need  to  be  protected  includes  four  parts  which  are:  (i)  usage  data;  information 
collected  from  computer  devices  (ii)  sensitive  information;  information  on  health,  bank  account  etc.  (iii)  Personally  identifiable 
information;  information  that  could  be  used  to  identify  the  individual  (iv)  Unique  device  identities;  information  that  might  be 
uniquely traceable e.g. IP addresses, unique hardware identities etc. 
 
2.2 Availability 
 
The availability ensures the reliable and timely access to cloud data or cloud computing resources by the appropriate personnel. The 
SaaS application providers are required to make sure that the systems are running as it should be when needed and enterprises are 
provided with services almost all the time. This involves making architectural changes at the application and infrastructural levels to 
add scalability and high availability. Resiliency to hardware/software malfunction, as well as to defiance of service attacks, needs to 
be built from the ground up within the application. 
 
2.3 Authentication and authorization 
 
The authentication and authorization applications for enterprise environments may need to be changed, to work with a safe cloud 
environment. Forensics tasks may  become much more difficult since the investigators may not be able to access system hardware 
physically.  Lio  introduces  two  factor  password  authentication  scheme  based  on  having  both  the  properties  of  discrete  logarithm 
problem  and  secure  one-way  hash  function  [16]. There  were  some  deficiencies  in  Lio  [16]  work;  to  overcome  those  deficiencies 
Yang [17] introduce a mutual authentication scheme based on smart card and password. In which smart card user registers at th e 
server  firstly  then  chooses  a  right  client  to  login and  sends  access  request  messages  to  the  server. Then  the  server  will  complete 
mutual authentication with the user after receiving the messages. 
 
2.4 Network Security 
 
In a SaaS deployment model, susceptible data is obtained from the enterprises, processed by the SaaS application and stores at the 
SaaS vendor end. All data flow across the network needs to be protected in order to avoid outflow of perceptive information. This 
involves  the  use  of  strong  network  traffic  encryption  techniques  such  as  Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL)  and  the  Transport  Layer 
Security (TLS) for security. 
 
In  case  of  Amazon  Web  Services  (AWS),  the  network  layer  provides  significant  protection  against  traditional  network  security 
issues, such as IP spoofing, port scanning, packet sniffing, etc. For highest protection, Amazon S3 is reachable via SSL encrypted 
endpoints. The encrypted end points are reachable from both the Internet and from within AmazonEC2, making it sure that data is 
transferred securely both within AWS and from sources outside of AWS [18]. However, malevolent users can exploit weak point in 
network security configuration to sniff network packets. 
 
2.5 Backup 
 
The SaaS vendor needs to ensure that all receptive enterprise data is backed up  on regular basis to  smooth the progress  of quick 
recovery in case of devastation. Also the use of strong encryption method to keep the backup data is suggested to avoid unintended 
leaching of receptive information. In the case of cloud cloud service provider such as Amazon, the data at rest in S3 is not encrypted 
by default. The users need to independently encrypt their data and backups so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

Abstract— SaaS (Software as a service) is one of the main service provided by cloud computing it has a feature of multi tenancy 
that virtually provides the services on one by one basis but physically all user utilize the services at same time.  It has received 
considerable attention  in  past  few years  and  an  increasing  number  of  countries  show  their  interest  in the  promotion  of  SaaS 
market. Although it has received significant attention but security issue is one of the major inhibitor in decreasing the growth of 
SaaS. Many organizations may still be hesitant to introduce SaaS mainly because of the trust and security concerns, they may 
observe more risks than benefits in introducing this service. In this study an attempt is made to discuss the security issues and

INTRODUCTION 

 
Cloud  computing  is  an  emerging  technology  which recently  has  drawn  significant attention  from  both  industry  and  academia.  It 
provides services over the internet, by using cloud computing user can utilize the online services of different software’s instead of 
purchasing or installing them at their own computers. 
 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-
demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing  resources,  e.g.  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and 
services, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [1]. Gartner

defines cloud computing as a style of computing in which elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service by using Internet 
technologies [2]. 
 
According  to  NIST  [1]  and  Seccombe  [3],  guidelines  for  cloud  computing,  it  has  four  different  deployment  models;  (a)  private 
cloud,  it  may  be  owned,  managed  and  operated  by  the  organization,  a third  party  or  some  combination  of  them.  (b)  Community 
cloud, it may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community. (c) Public cloud, the cloud 
infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed and operated by business, academic, or 
government  organization.  (d)  Hybrid  cloud,  the  cloud  infrastructure  is  composition  of  two  or  more  distinct  cloud  infrastructures. 
There are three different delivery models that are utilized within a particular deployment model. These delivery models are; (a) SaaS 
(Software as a Service), it enables the user to access online applications and software that are hosted by the service providers. (b) 
PaaS  (Platform  as  a  Service),  it  provides  platform  for  developing  applications  by  using  different  programming  languages(c)IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Service), provides the use of virtual computer infrastructure environment, online storage, hardware, servers and 
networking components

SaaS  is  a  software  deployment  model  where  applications  are  remotely  hosted  by  the  application  or  service  provider  and  made 
available  to  customers  on  demand,  over  the  Internet.  The  SaaS  model  offers  the  customers  with  considerable  benefits,  such  as 
improved operational efficiency and reduced costs. SaaS is rapidly emerging as the dominant delivery model for meeting the needs 
of enterprise IT services. However, most enterprises are still uncomfortable with the SaaS model due to lack of visibility about the 
way their data is stored and secured. 
 
The  global  SaaS market  is  expected  to reach  12.1  billion USD  by  2014, reflecting a  compound  annual  growth rate  of  26%. This 
rapid growth of the SaaS market has had considerable influence on the software market [5, 6].  SaaS is an outsourcing innovation 
that transforms IT resources into continuously provided services [7]. This unique feature of SaaS has allowed the SaaS market to 
grow six times faster than the packaged software market and is expected to facilitate further development of SaaS [8].  However, 
despite of rapid growth of SaaS, it suffers with lot of security concerns. According to [5] new SaaS market, inducing SaaS adoption 
is likely to be difficult due to major inhibitors, such as limited integration and flexibility. 
 
Our main area of concern in this paper is  to highlight  security issues and their existing solutions in SaaS model. This best-known 
branch  of  cloud  computing  represents  a  delivery  model  in  which  applications  are  hosted  and  supervised  in  a  service  provider's 
datacenter. The paper illustrates the assorted security issues of cloud computing with respect to SaaS service delivery model.

II.  SECURITY ISSUES IN SaaS 

 
Many vendors declared that adoption of SaaS technology can bring out many benefits to the users such as cost reduction, yet some 
organization  are  still not  feeling  comfortable  in  adoption  of  SaaS  due  mainly  to  trust  concern  e.g, data  security  [9,10].  The  trust 
issue  is  needed  to  be  improved  to  get  the  users  attraction.  SaaS  is  encouraging  solution  in  expanding  the  organization’s  IT 
performance but many organizations still avoid in adoption of this technology because of lack of trust [11]. Most of the companies 
that have critical data wanted to self-support their own architecture or keep the data at their site or wanted to modify the software at 
their choosing but SaaS is not flexible to meet their needs.  
 
The removal of data from service provider end is also a threatening issue. Hayes raises a point that there is no way to know  that the 
cloud computing service providers properly deleted the client removed data or they saved it for some unknown reasons [12].In SaaS 
environment user do not know that where the data is exactly stores, cloud computing moves databases and application software’s to 
large data centers where the management of services are not reliable. This sole aspect poses many new security challenges [13]. In 
SaaS environment provider must ensure that the multiple users don’t get to see each other’s data. So, it becomes important to the 
user to ensure that right security measures are in place and also difficult to get an assurance that the application will be available 
when needed [14]. 
                           
In the SaaS model, user data is stored at the SaaS provider’s data center, along with the data of other users. If the SaaS provider is 
dealing  with  public  cloud  computing  service,  the  enterprise  data  might  be  stored  along  with  the  data  of  other  unrelated  SaaS 
applications.  The  cloud  provider  might,  additionally,  replicate  the  data  at  multiple  locations  across  countries  for  the  purposes  of 
maintaining high availability. There is a great deal of anxiety with the lack of control and awareness of how user’s data is stored and 
secured in the SaaS model.  
 
The  key  security  rudiments  should  be  carefully  considered  as  a  fundamental  part  of  the  SaaS  application  development  and 
deployment  process  include;  Data  security,  Network  security,  Data  locality,  Data  integrity,  Data  segregation,  Data  access, 
Authentication  and  authorization,  Data  confidentiality,  Web  application  security,  Data  breaches,  Virtualization,  Availability, 
Backup  and  Identity  management  [10].  Fig  2  indicates  some  important  security  issues  in  SaaS  delivery  model.  Some  of  the 
important security challenges are described below.

information;  information  that  could  be  used  to  identify  the  individual  (iv)  Unique  device  identities;  information  that  might  be 
uniquely traceable e.g. IP addresses, unique hardware identities etc.

SaaS application providers are required to make sure that the systems are running as it should be when needed and enterprises are 
provided with services almost all the time. This involves making architectural changes at the application and infrastructural levels to

environment. Forensics tasks may  become much more difficult since the investigators may not be able to access system hardware 
physically.  Lio  introduces  two  factor  password  authentication  scheme  based  on  having  both  the  properties  of  discrete  logarithm 
problem  and  secure  one-way  hash  function  [16]. There  were  some  deficiencies  in  Lio  [16]  work;  to  overcome  those  deficiencies 
Yang [17] introduce a mutual authentication scheme based on smart card and password. In which smart card user registers at th e

2.6 Data breaches 
 
Data  from  different  users  and  organizations  lie  together  in  a  cloud  environment.  The  chance  of  breaching  into  the  cloud 
surroundings will potentially attack the data of all the users. Thus, the cloud becomes a high value intention [19]. In the Verizon 
Business  breach  report  blog  it  has  been  stated  that  external  criminals  pose  the  greatest  threat  (73  percent),  but  achieve  the  least 
impact  (30,000  compromised  records),  resulting  in  a  Virtualization  vulnerability  [20].  Though  SaaS  supporter  claim  that  SaaS 
providers can provide better security to customers data than by conventional means, Insiders still have access to the data but it is just 
that they are accessing it in a different way. Insiders do not have direct access to databases, but it does not reduce the risk of insider 
breaches which can be a massive impact on the security. 
 
2.7 Data Integrity 
 
Data integrity is  one of the most serious elements in any system. Data integrity is  easily achieved in  an individual system with a 
single  database.  Data  integrity  in  such  a  system  is  maintained  via  database  transactions.  Transactions  should  follow  ACID 
(atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) properties to ensure data integrity. Most databases support ACID transactions and 
can defend data integrity. 
In a distributed system environment, there are multiple databases and applications. In order to maintain data integrity in a distributed 
system, transactions across multiple data sources need to be handled correctly in a fail safe manner.  One method for verifying the 
integrity of a set of data is based on hash values. A hash value is derived by condensing a set of data into a single unique value by 
way of a pre-defined algorithm. 
 
2.8 Web application security 
 
SaaS  application  development  may  use  various  types  of  software  components  and  frameworks.  These  tools  can  reduce  time-to-
market  and  the  cost  of  converting  a  traditional  software  product  or  building  and  deploying  a  new  SaaS  solution.  One  of  the 
mandatory  requirements  for  SaaS  applications  is  that it has  to  be  used  and  managed  over  the  web  [21].  Security  gap  in  the  web 
applications thus create a weakness to the SaaS application. In this scenario, the weakness can potentially have unfavorable impact 
on all of the customers using the cloud. Web applications introduce new security risks that cannot effectively be defended against at 
the network level, and do require application level defenses. The Open Web Application Security Project [22] has provided the ten 
most critical web applications security threats. 
 

 

III.  EXISTING SECURITY SOLUTIONS 

Many researchers contribute their efforts to resolve the security threats like data security, network security, availability, backup and 
recovery,  authentication  etc.,  in  this  delivery  model.  Shutting  down  the  unused  services  keep  patches  update  and  reduces 
accessibility  of  unknown  users  [23].  Security  of  data  during  processing  may  be  possible  by  resource  isolation  which enables  the 
deployment  of  VMs  with  isolation  enhanced  SLAs  (service  level  agreement)  [24].  In  [25]  technique  provides  a  new  way  to 
authenticate  in  3-dimensional  approaches.  It  provides  availability  of  data  by  overcoming  many  existing  problem  like  denial  of 
services and data leakage etc. But in this model, the data stored is not in encrypted form and once the login information is  lost, the 
data can easily be retrieved by any unauthorized user.  
 
In [26] kamara and lauter proposed a model by using technique that purely based on cryptographic storage services. In which when 
a user wants to send data to other user, they first generate a master key that encrypts their message. The message will be decrypted 
by  the  secret  key  for  decryption  stored  on  receiver  system.  The  searching  method  is  not  very  efficient  for  encrypted  data.  They 
discussed  encrypted  data  searching  techniques;  symmetric  searchable  encryption  (SSE)  and  asymmetric  searchable  encryption 
(ASE) but these techniques increase the complexity. [27] Discussed the drawbacks of symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) and 
asymmetric searchable encryption (ASE) techniques and suggested that these techniques are not useful over cloud. It introduce new 
model by using order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE) technique but this model did not provide any information about the 
security attacks, confidentiality and integrity. 
 
[28] Presents Cloud Proof, a secure storage system for increasing security over cloud. The proposed model use cryptographic tools 
to obtain an efficient and scalable system which allow users to detect and prove cloud misbehavior. This model helps users to detect

The  global  SaaS market  is  expected  to reach  12.1  billion USD  by  2014, reflecting a  compound  annual  growth rate  of  26%. This 
rapid growth of the SaaS market has had considerable influence on the software market [5, 6].  SaaS is an outsourcing innovation 
that transforms IT resources into continuously provided services [7]. This unique feature of SaaS has allowed the SaaS market to 
grow six times faster than the packaged software market and is expected to facilitate further development of SaaS [8].  However, 
despite of rapid growth of SaaS, it suffers with lot of security concerns. According to [5] new SaaS market, inducing SaaS adoption 
is likely to be difficult due to major inhibitors, such as limited integration and flexibility. 
 
Our main area of concern in this paper is  to highlight  security issues and their existing solutions in SaaS model. This best-known 
branch  of  cloud  computing  represents  a  delivery  model  in  which  applications  are  hosted  and  supervised  in  a  service  provider's 
datacenter. The paper illustrates the assorted security issues of cloud computing with respect to SaaS service delivery model.

II.  SECURITY ISSUES IN SaaS 

 
Many vendors declared that adoption of SaaS technology can bring out many benefits to the users such as cost reduction, yet some 
organization  are  still not  feeling  comfortable  in  adoption  of  SaaS  due  mainly  to  trust  concern  e.g, data  security  [9,10].  The  trust 
issue  is  needed  to  be  improved  to  get  the  users  attraction.  SaaS  is  encouraging  solution  in  expanding  the  organization’s  IT 
performance but many organizations still avoid in adoption of this technology because of lack of trust [11]. Most of the companies 
that have critical data wanted to self-support their own architecture or keep the data at their site or wanted to modify the software at 
their choosing but SaaS is not flexible to meet their needs.  
 
The removal of data from service provider end is also a threatening issue. Hayes raises a point that there is no way to know  that the 
cloud computing service providers properly deleted the client removed data or they saved it for some unknown reasons [12].In SaaS 
environment user do not know that where the data is exactly stores, cloud computing moves databases and application software’s to 
large data centers where the management of services are not reliable. This sole aspect poses many new security challenges [13]. In 
SaaS environment provider must ensure that the multiple users don’t get to see each other’s data. So, it becomes important to the 
user to ensure that right security measures are in place and also difficult to get an assurance that the application will be available 
when needed [14]. 
                           
In the SaaS model, user data is stored at the SaaS provider’s data center, along with the data of other users. If the SaaS provider is 
dealing  with  public  cloud  computing  service,  the  enterprise  data  might  be  stored  along  with  the  data  of  other  unrelated  SaaS 
applications.  The  cloud  provider  might,  additionally,  replicate  the  data  at  multiple  locations  across  countries  for  the  purposes  of 
maintaining high availability. There is a great deal of anxiety with the lack of control and awareness of how user’s data is stored and 
secured in the SaaS model.  
 
The  key  security  rudiments  should  be  carefully  considered  as  a  fundamental  part  of  the  SaaS  application  development  and 
deployment  process  include;  Data  security,  Network  security,  Data  locality,  Data  integrity,  Data  segregation,  Data  access, 
Authentication  and  authorization,  Data  confidentiality,  Web  application  security,  Data  breaches,  Virtualization,  Availability, 
Backup  and  Identity  management  [10].  Fig  2  indicates  some  important  security  issues  in  SaaS  delivery  model.  Some  of  the 
important security challenges are described below.

2.1 Data Security 
 
Data security is one of the leading and most cited issue in SaaS delivery model. Data security may be a major concern for users who 
wants to introduce cloud computing. This technology needs proper security principles and mechanisms to eliminate users concerns. 
For example, most cloud services users have concerns about their private data that it may be used for other purposes or sent to other 
cloud  service  providers  [15].  The  user  data  that  need  to  be  protected  includes  four  parts  which  are:  (i)  usage  data;  information 
collected  from  computer  devices  (ii)  sensitive  information;  information  on  health,  bank  account  etc.  (iii)  Personally  identifiable 
information;  information  that  could  be  used  to  identify  the  individual  (iv)  Unique  device  identities;  information  that  might  be 
uniquely traceable e.g. IP addresses, unique hardware identities etc. 
 
2.2 Availability 
 
The availability ensures the reliable and timely access to cloud data or cloud computing resources by the appropriate personnel. The 
SaaS application providers are required to make sure that the systems are running as it should be when needed and enterprises are 
provided with services almost all the time. This involves making architectural changes at the application and infrastructural levels to 
add scalability and high availability. Resiliency to hardware/software malfunction, as well as to defiance of service attacks, needs to 
be built from the ground up within the application. 
 
2.3 Authentication and authorization 
 
The authentication and authorization applications for enterprise environments may need to be changed, to work with a safe cloud 
environment. Forensics tasks may  become much more difficult since the investigators may not be able to access system hardware 
physically.  Lio  introduces  two  factor  password  authentication  scheme  based  on  having  both  the  properties  of  discrete  logarithm 
problem  and  secure  one-way  hash  function  [16]. There  were  some  deficiencies  in  Lio  [16]  work;  to  overcome  those  deficiencies 
Yang [17] introduce a mutual authentication scheme based on smart card and password. In which smart card user registers at th e 
server  firstly  then  chooses  a  right  client  to  login and  sends  access  request  messages  to  the  server. Then  the  server  will  complete 
mutual authentication with the user after receiving the messages. 
 
2.4 Network Security 
 
In a SaaS deployment model, susceptible data is obtained from the enterprises, processed by the SaaS application and stores at the 
SaaS vendor end. All data flow across the network needs to be protected in order to avoid outflow of perceptive information. This 
involves  the  use  of  strong  network  traffic  encryption  techniques  such  as  Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL)  and  the  Transport  Layer 
Security (TLS) for security. 
 
In  case  of  Amazon  Web  Services  (AWS),  the  network  layer  provides  significant  protection  against  traditional  network  security 
issues, such as IP spoofing, port scanning, packet sniffing, etc. For highest protection, Amazon S3 is reachable via SSL encrypted 
endpoints. The encrypted end points are reachable from both the Internet and from within AmazonEC2, making it sure that data is 
transferred securely both within AWS and from sources outside of AWS [18]. However, malevolent users can exploit weak point in 
network security configuration to sniff network packets. 
 
2.5 Backup 
 
The SaaS vendor needs to ensure that all receptive enterprise data is backed up  on regular basis to  smooth the progress  of quick 
recovery in case of devastation. Also the use of strong encryption method to keep the backup data is suggested to avoid unintended 
leaching of receptive information. In the case of cloud cloud service provider such as Amazon, the data at rest in S3 is not encrypted 
by default. The users need to independently encrypt their data and backups so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

2.6 Data breaches 
 
Data  from  different  users  and  organizations  lie  together  in  a  cloud  environment.  The  chance  of  breaching  into  the  cloud 
surroundings will potentially attack the data of all the users. Thus, the cloud becomes a high value intention [19]. In the Verizon 
Business  breach  report  blog  it  has  been  stated  that  external  criminals  pose  the  greatest  threat  (73  percent),  but  achieve  the  least 
impact  (30,000  compromised  records),  resulting  in  a  Virtualization  vulnerability  [20].  Though  SaaS  supporter  claim  that  SaaS 
providers can provide better security to customers data than by conventional means, Insiders still have access to the data but it is just 
that they are accessing it in a different way. Insiders do not have direct access to databases, but it does not reduce the risk of insider 
breaches which can be a massive impact on the security. 
 
2.7 Data Integrity 
 
Data integrity is  one of the most serious elements in any system. Data integrity is  easily achieved in  an individual system with a 
single  database.  Data  integrity  in  such  a  system  is  maintained  via  database  transactions.  Transactions  should  follow  ACID 
(atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) properties to ensure data integrity. Most databases support ACID transactions and 
can defend data integrity. 
In a distributed system environment, there are multiple databases and applications. In order to maintain data integrity in a distributed 
system, transactions across multiple data sources need to be handled correctly in a fail safe manner.  One method for verifying the 
integrity of a set of data is based on hash values. A hash value is derived by condensing a set of data into a single unique value by 
way of a pre-defined algorithm. 
 
2.8 Web application security 
 
SaaS  application  development  may  use  various  types  of  software  components  and  frameworks.  These  tools  can  reduce  time-to-
market  and  the  cost  of  converting  a  traditional  software  product  or  building  and  deploying  a  new  SaaS  solution.  One  of  the 
mandatory  requirements  for  SaaS  applications  is  that it has  to  be  used  and  managed  over  the  web  [21].  Security  gap  in  the  web 
applications thus create a weakness to the SaaS application. In this scenario, the weakness can potentially have unfavorable impact 
on all of the customers using the cloud. Web applications introduce new security risks that cannot effectively be defended against at 
the network level, and do require application level defenses. The Open Web Application Security Project [22] has provided the ten 
most critical web applications security threats. 
 

 

III.  EXISTING SECURITY SOLUTIONS 

Many researchers contribute their efforts to resolve the security threats like data security, network security, availability, backup and 
recovery,  authentication  etc.,  in  this  delivery  model.  Shutting  down  the  unused  services  keep  patches  update  and  reduces 
accessibility  of  unknown  users  [23].  Security  of  data  during  processing  may  be  possible  by  resource  isolation  which enables  the 
deployment  of  VMs  with  isolation  enhanced  SLAs  (service  level  agreement)  [24].  In  [25]  technique  provides  a  new  way  to 
authenticate  in  3-dimensional  approaches.  It  provides  availability  of  data  by  overcoming  many  existing  problem  like  denial  of 
services and data leakage etc. But in this model, the data stored is not in encrypted form and once the login information is  lost, the 
data can easily be retrieved by any unauthorized user.  
 
In [26] kamara and lauter proposed a model by using technique that purely based on cryptographic storage services. In which when 
a user wants to send data to other user, they first generate a master key that encrypts their message. The message will be decrypted 
by  the  secret  key  for  decryption  stored  on  receiver  system.  The  searching  method  is  not  very  efficient  for  encrypted  data.  They 
discussed  encrypted  data  searching  techniques;  symmetric  searchable  encryption  (SSE)  and  asymmetric  searchable  encryption 
(ASE) but these techniques increase the complexity. [27] Discussed the drawbacks of symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) and 
asymmetric searchable encryption (ASE) techniques and suggested that these techniques are not useful over cloud. It introduce new 
model by using order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE) technique but this model did not provide any information about the 
security attacks, confidentiality and integrity. 
 
[28] Presents Cloud Proof, a secure storage system for increasing security over cloud. The proposed model use cryptographic tools 
to obtain an efficient and scalable system which allow users to detect and prove cloud misbehavior. This model helps users to detect

violations of confidentiality and integrity. [29] Proposed a three-layer system structure model in which each layer performs its own 
duty to ensure that the data security. First layer is responsible for authentication, Second layer is responsible for data en cryption and 
third layer is for data recovery. [30] Discuss the problems in cloud computing like security  of data, files system and backups and 
proposed  a  concept  of  digital  signature  with  RSA  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data  while  transferring  it  over  the  network.  This 
technique solves the problem of authentication and security. 
 
[31]  Implement  software  to  cloud  provider. This  software  is  implemented  with  two  factor  authentications  and  compares  between 
eight  modem  encryption  algorithms.  The  proposed  software  gets  the  faster  and  the  highest  security  algorithm  based  on  cloud 
infrastructure  and  it  also  advices  to  cloud  users  to  select  the  most  secure  and  faster  algorithm  that  suitable  to  existing  cloud 
architecture. [32] declares the data security is one of the primary inhibitor of cloud computing and provide analysis on data security 
across all stages of data life cycle and proposed  a system to protect data using various schemes like airavat etc. This system can 
prevent  privacy  leakage  without  authorizations  in  map reduce  computing  process,  the  weakness  in  this  work  is  that  it was  just  a 
theory which depend on others schemes for its implementation. 
 
The best security solution for web applications is to develop a development framework that has tough security architecture. In [33] 
four-tier  framework  for  web-based  development  is  proposed  that  though  seems  interesting,  only  implies  a  security  facet  in  the 
process. 
 
 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

 

In this paper an overview of cloud computing deployment and delivery models has been provided.  As described in the paper there 
are many advantages of adopting SaaS delivery model of cloud computing such as reduction of operation cost and IT load etc. On 
the  other  hand  there  are  yet  many  security  concerns  in  this  delivery  model  that  needs  serious  attention  of  researchers  to  get  the 
attraction of users. Although it is a fastest growing service of cloud computing but it suffers with security issues. A few studies are 
available in literature which addresses the different solutions of security problems but these solutions are not enough to fulfill the 
requirements of users. We also described some important security issues in SaaS model and their available solutions. Proper security 
measures are required to get the trust of users in this latest technology. Therefore security issues still need an exploratory study to 
revisit the dimensions of this research area. Data security is one of the major inhibitor in the growth of this well known technology. 
In future we are aiming to provide a detail systematic literature review on data security issue in cloud computing environment.

Abstract— SaaS (Software as a service) is one of the main service provided by cloud computing it has a feature of multi tenancy 
that virtually provides the services on one by one basis but physically all user utilize the services at same time.  It has received 
considerable attention  in  past  few years  and  an  increasing  number  of  countries  show  their  interest  in the  promotion  of  SaaS 
market. Although it has received significant attention but security issue is one of the major inhibitor in decreasing the growth of 
SaaS. Many organizations may still be hesitant to introduce SaaS mainly because of the trust and security concerns, they may 
observe more risks than benefits in introducing this service. In this study an attempt is made to discuss the security issues and 
their existing solutions in SaaS delivery model of cloud computing.

INTRODUCTION 

 
Cloud  computing  is  an  emerging  technology  which recently  has  drawn  significant attention  from  both  industry  and  academia.  It 
provides services over the internet, by using cloud computing user can utilize the online services of different software’s instead of 
purchasing or installing them at their own computers. 
 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-
demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing  resources,  e.g.  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and 
services, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [1]. Gartner

defines cloud computing as a style of computing in which elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service by using Internet 
technologies [2]. 
 
According  to  NIST  [1]  and  Seccombe  [3],  guidelines  for  cloud  computing,  it  has  four  different  deployment  models;  (a)  private 
cloud,  it  may  be  owned,  managed  and  operated  by  the  organization,  a third  party  or  some  combination  of  them.  (b)  Community 
cloud, it may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community. (c) Public cloud, the cloud 
infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed and operated by business, academic, or 
government  organization.  (d)  Hybrid  cloud,  the  cloud  infrastructure  is  composition  of  two  or  more  distinct  cloud  infrastructures. 
There are three different delivery models that are utilized within a particular deployment model. These delivery models are; (a) SaaS 
(Software as a Service), it enables the user to access online applications and software that are hosted by the service providers. (b) 
PaaS  (Platform  as  a  Service),  it  provides  platform  for  developing  applications  by  using  different  programming  languages(c)IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Service), provides the use of virtual computer infrastructure environment, online storage, hardware, servers and 
networking components

SaaS  is  a  software  deployment  model  where  applications  are  remotely  hosted  by  the  application  or  service  provider  and  made 
available  to  customers  on  demand,  over  the  Internet.  The  SaaS  model  offers  the  customers  with  considerable  benefits,  such  as 
improved operational efficiency and reduced costs. SaaS is rapidly emerging as the dominant delivery model for meeting the needs 
of enterprise IT services. However, most enterprises are still uncomfortable with the SaaS model due to lack of visibility about the 
way their data is stored and secured. 
 
The  global  SaaS market  is  expected  to reach  12.1  billion USD  by  2014, reflecting a  compound  annual  growth rate  of  26%. This 
rapid growth of the SaaS market has had considerable influence on the software market [5, 6].  SaaS is an outsourcing innovation 
that transforms IT resources into continuously provided services [7]. This unique feature of SaaS has allowed the SaaS market to 
grow six times faster than the packaged software market and is expected to facilitate further development of SaaS [8].  However, 
despite of rapid growth of SaaS, it suffers with lot of security concerns. According to [5] new SaaS market, inducing SaaS adoption 
is likely to be difficult due to major inhibitors, such as limited integration and flexibility. 
 
Our main area of concern in this paper is  to highlight  security issues and their existing solutions in SaaS model. This best-known 
branch  of  cloud  computing  represents  a  delivery  model  in  which  applications  are  hosted  and  supervised  in  a  service  provider's 
datacenter. The paper illustrates the assorted security issues of cloud computing with respect to SaaS service delivery model.

II.  SECURITY ISSUES IN SaaS 

 
Many vendors declared that adoption of SaaS technology can bring out many benefits to the users such as cost reduction, yet some 
organization  are  still not  feeling  comfortable  in  adoption  of  SaaS  due  mainly  to  trust  concern  e.g, data  security  [9,10].  The  trust 
issue  is  needed  to  be  improved  to  get  the  users  attraction.  SaaS  is  encouraging  solution  in  expanding  the  organization’s  IT 
performance but many organizations still avoid in adoption of this technology because of lack of trust [11]. Most of the companies 
that have critical data wanted to self-support their own architecture or keep the data at their site or wanted to modify the software at 
their choosing but SaaS is not flexible to meet their needs.  
 
The removal of data from service provider end is also a threatening issue. Hayes raises a point that there is no way to know  that the 
cloud computing service providers properly deleted the client removed data or they saved it for some unknown reasons [12].In SaaS 
environment user do not know that where the data is exactly stores, cloud computing moves databases and application software’s to 
large data centers where the management of services are not reliable. This sole aspect poses many new security challenges [13]. In 
SaaS environment provider must ensure that the multiple users don’t get to see each other’s data. So, it becomes important to the 
user to ensure that right security measures are in place and also difficult to get an assurance that the application will be available 
when needed [14]. 
                           
In the SaaS model, user data is stored at the SaaS provider’s data center, along with the data of other users. If the SaaS provider is 
dealing  with  public  cloud  computing  service,  the  enterprise  data  might  be  stored  along  with  the  data  of  other  unrelated  SaaS 
applications.  The  cloud  provider  might,  additionally,  replicate  the  data  at  multiple  locations  across  countries  for  the  purposes  of 
maintaining high availability. There is a great deal of anxiety with the lack of control and awareness of how user’s data is stored and 
secured in the SaaS model.  
 
The  key  security  rudiments  should  be  carefully  considered  as  a  fundamental  part  of  the  SaaS  application  development  and 
deployment  process  include;  Data  security,  Network  security,  Data  locality,  Data  integrity,  Data  segregation,  Data  access,

2.1 Data Security 
 
Data security is one of the leading and most cited issue in SaaS delivery model. Data security may be a major concern for users who 
wants to introduce cloud computing. This technology needs proper security principles and mechanisms to eliminate users concerns. 
For example, most cloud services users have concerns about their private data that it may be used for other purposes or sent to other 
cloud  service  providers  [15].  The  user  data  that  need  to  be  protected  includes  four  parts  which  are:  (i)  usage  data;  information 
collected  from  computer  devices  (ii)  sensitive  information;  information  on  health,  bank  account  etc.  (iii)  Personally  identifiable 
information;  information  that  could  be  used  to  identify  the  individual  (iv)  Unique  device  identities;  information  that  might  be 
uniquely traceable e.g. IP addresses, unique hardware identities etc. 
 
2.2 Availability 
 
The availability ensures the reliable and timely access to cloud data or cloud computing resources by the appropriate personnel. The 
SaaS application providers are required to make sure that the systems are running as it should be when needed and enterprises are 
provided with services almost all the time. This involves making architectural changes at the application and infrastructural levels to 
add scalability and high availability. Resiliency to hardware/software malfunction, as well as to defiance of service attacks, needs to 
be built from the ground up within the application. 
 
2.3 Authentication and authorization 
 
The authentication and authorization applications for enterprise environments may need to be changed, to work with a safe cloud 
environment. Forensics tasks may  become much more difficult since the investigators may not be able to access system hardware 
physically.  Lio  introduces  two  factor  password  authentication  scheme  based  on  having  both  the  properties  of  discrete  logarithm 
problem  and  secure  one-way  hash  function  [16]. There  were  some  deficiencies  in  Lio  [16]  work;  to  overcome  those  deficiencies 
Yang [17] introduce a mutual authentication scheme based on smart card and password. In which smart card user registers at th e 
server  firstly  then  chooses  a  right  client  to  login and  sends  access  request  messages  to  the  server. Then  the  server  will  complete 
mutual authentication with the user after receiving the messages. 
 
2.4 Network Security 
 
In a SaaS deployment model, susceptible data is obtained from the enterprises, processed by the SaaS application and stores at the 
SaaS vendor end. All data flow across the network needs to be protected in order to avoid outflow of perceptive information. This 
involves  the  use  of  strong  network  traffic  encryption  techniques  such  as  Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL)  and  the  Transport  Layer 
Security (TLS) for security. 
 
In  case  of  Amazon  Web  Services  (AWS),  the  network  layer  provides  significant  protection  against  traditional  network  security 
issues, such as IP spoofing, port scanning, packet sniffing, etc. For highest protection, Amazon S3 is reachable via SSL encrypted 
endpoints. The encrypted end points are reachable from both the Internet and from within AmazonEC2, making it sure that data is 
transferred securely both within AWS and from sources outside of AWS [18]. However, malevolent users can exploit weak point in 
network security configuration to sniff network packets. 
 
2.5 Backup 
 
The SaaS vendor needs to ensure that all receptive enterprise data is backed up  on regular basis to  smooth the progress  of quick 
recovery in case of devastation. Also the use of strong encryption method to keep the backup data is suggested to avoid unintended 
leaching of receptive information. In the case of cloud cloud service provider such as Amazon, the data at rest in S3 is not encrypted 
by default. The users need to independently encrypt their data and backups so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

2.6 Data breaches 
 
Data  from  different  users  and  organizations  lie  together  in  a  cloud  environment.  The  chance  of  breaching  into  the  cloud 
surroundings will potentially attack the data of all the users. Thus, the cloud becomes a high value intention [19]. In the Verizon 
Business  breach  report  blog  it  has  been  stated  that  external  criminals  pose  the  greatest  threat  (73  percent),  but  achieve  the  least 
impact  (30,000  compromised  records),  resulting  in  a  Virtualization  vulnerability  [20].  Though  SaaS  supporter  claim  that  SaaS 
providers can provide better security to customers data than by conventional means, Insiders still have access to the data but it is just 
that they are accessing it in a different way. Insiders do not have direct access to databases, but it does not reduce the risk of insider 
breaches which can be a massive impact on the security. 
 
2.7 Data Integrity 
 
Data integrity is  one of the most serious elements in any system. Data integrity is  easily achieved in  an individual system with a 
single  database.  Data  integrity  in  such  a  system  is  maintained  via  database  transactions.  Transactions  should  follow  ACID 
(atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) properties to ensure data integrity. Most databases support ACID transactions and 
can defend data integrity. 
In a distributed system environment, there are multiple databases and applications. In order to maintain data integrity in a distributed 
system, transactions across multiple data sources need to be handled correctly in a fail safe manner.  One method for verifying the 
integrity of a set of data is based on hash values. A hash value is derived by condensing a set of data into a single unique value by 
way of a pre-defined algorithm. 
 
2.8 Web application security 
 
SaaS  application  development  may  use  various  types  of  software  components  and  frameworks.  These  tools  can  reduce  time-to-
market  and  the  cost  of  converting  a  traditional  software  product  or  building  and  deploying  a  new  SaaS  solution.  One  of  the 
mandatory  requirements  for  SaaS  applications  is  that it has  to  be  used  and  managed  over  the  web  [21].  Security  gap  in  the  web 
applications thus create a weakness to the SaaS application. In this scenario, the weakness can potentially have unfavorable impact 
on all of the customers using the cloud. Web applications introduce new security risks that cannot effectively be defended against at 
the network level, and do require application level defenses. The Open Web Application Security Project [22] has provided the ten 
most critical web applications security threats. 
 

 

III.  EXISTING SECURITY SOLUTIONS 

Many researchers contribute their efforts to resolve the security threats like data security, network security, availability, backup and 
recovery,  authentication  etc.,  in  this  delivery  model.  Shutting  down  the  unused  services  keep  patches  update  and  reduces 
accessibility  of  unknown  users  [23].  Security  of  data  during  processing  may  be  possible  by  resource  isolation  which enables  the 
deployment  of  VMs  with  isolation  enhanced  SLAs  (service  level  agreement)  [24].  In  [25]  technique  provides  a  new  way  to 
authenticate  in  3-dimensional  approaches.  It  provides  availability  of  data  by  overcoming  many  existing  problem  like  denial  of 
services and data leakage etc. But in this model, the data stored is not in encrypted form and once the login information is  lost, the 
data can easily be retrieved by any unauthorized user.  
 
In [26] kamara and lauter proposed a model by using technique that purely based on cryptographic storage services. In which when 
a user wants to send data to other user, they first generate a master key that encrypts their message. The message will be decrypted 
by  the  secret  key  for  decryption  stored  on  receiver  system.  The  searching  method  is  not  very  efficient  for  encrypted  data.  They 
discussed  encrypted  data  searching  techniques;  symmetric  searchable  encryption  (SSE)  and  asymmetric  searchable  encryption 
(ASE) but these techniques increase the complexity. [27] Discussed the drawbacks of symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) and 
asymmetric searchable encryption (ASE) techniques and suggested that these techniques are not useful over cloud. It introduce new 
model by using order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE) technique but this model did not provide any information about the 
security attacks, confidentiality and integrity. 
 
[28] Presents Cloud Proof, a secure storage system for increasing security over cloud. The proposed model use cryptographic tools 
to obtain an efficient and scalable system which allow users to detect and prove cloud misbehavior. This model helps users to detect

violations of confidentiality and integrity. [29] Proposed a three-layer system structure model in which each layer performs its own 
duty to ensure that the data security. First layer is responsible for authentication, Second layer is responsible for data en cryption and 
third layer is for data recovery. [30] Discuss the problems in cloud computing like security  of data, files system and backups and 
proposed  a  concept  of  digital  signature  with  RSA  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data  while  transferring  it  over  the  network.  This 
technique solves the problem of authentication and security. 
 
[31]  Implement  software  to  cloud  provider. This  software  is  implemented  with  two  factor  authentications  and  compares  between 
eight  modem  encryption  algorithms.  The  proposed  software  gets  the  faster  and  the  highest  security  algorithm  based  on  cloud 
infrastructure  and  it  also  advices  to  cloud  users  to  select  the  most  secure  and  faster  algorithm  that  suitable  to  existing  cloud 
architecture. [32] declares the data security is one of the primary inhibitor of cloud computing and provide analysis on data security 
across all stages of data life cycle and proposed  a system to protect data using various schemes like airavat etc. This system can 
prevent  privacy  leakage  without  authorizations  in  map reduce  computing  process,  the  weakness  in  this  work  is  that  it was  just  a 
theory which depend on others schemes for its implementation. 
 
The best security solution for web applications is to develop a development framework that has tough security architecture. In [33] 
four-tier  framework  for  web-based  development  is  proposed  that  though  seems  interesting,  only  implies  a  security  facet  in  the 
process. 
 
 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

 

In this paper an overview of cloud computing deployment and delivery models has been provided.  As described in the paper there 
are many advantages of adopting SaaS delivery model of cloud computing such as reduction of operation cost and IT load etc. On 
the  other  hand  there  are  yet  many  security  concerns  in  this  delivery  model  that  needs  serious  attention  of  researchers  to  get  the 
attraction of users. Although it is a fastest growing service of cloud computing but it suffers with security issues. A few studies are 
available in literature which addresses the different solutions of security problems but these solutions are not enough to fulfill the 
requirements of users. We also described some important security issues in SaaS model and their available solutions. Proper security 
measures are required to get the trust of users in this latest technology. Therefore security issues still need an exploratory study to 
revisit the dimensions of this research area. Data security is one of the major inhibitor in the growth of this well known technology. 
In future we are aiming to provide a detail systematic literature review on data security issue in cloud computing environment.
