cloud  service  architecture  is  always  a  big  concern  for  the  vendor  as  well  as  users.  In  this
paper distributed cloud service architecture is considered which is used as network detection
system for outer attacks to the cloud architecture. Outer attacks can be prevented by security
services such as McAfee, Imperva etc. but insider attacks are very difficult to detect and to
avoid them, different resources consuming processes are considered. So to provide solution
for  security  without  spending  many  resources,  encryption  of  messages  is  a  good  option.
Hash function encryption is easy and light encryption process which will challenge the odds
and can be suitable for cloud computing structures.

INTRODUCTION
At  the  present  world  of  networking  system  Cloud  computing  is
one  the  most  important  and  developing  concept  for  both  the
developers  and  the users.  Therefore  in  recent  days  providing
security in cloud has become a major challenging issue in cloud
computing. Cloud computing is primarily based on virtualization
which  enables  multi  tenancy  and  on-demand  use  of  scalable
shared resources by all tenants [3][4]. Cloud computing provides
the facility to access shared resources and common infrastructure
which offers the services on demand over the network to perform
operations  that  meet  changing  business  needs.  The  location  of
physical resources and the devices which are being accessed are
not known to the end user. It also provides facilities for users to
develop deploy and manage their applications on the cloud which
entails  virtualization  of  resources  that  maintains  and  manages
itself. Overlay  networks have  also  received  much  attention  in
recent years. Overlay networks were first used in the deployment
of the Internet over telephone networks [1]. By definition, they are
virtual networks built on top of physical networks. They consist of
virtual  nodes  connected  via  virtual  links  and  aim  to  offer
additional functionalities which are not available in the underlying
physical network [2].Because overlay networks are also based on
virtualized  nodes  for 
implementing  network  services  both
techniques  are  combined to  reap  the  benefits  of  each.  This  is
particularly useful for deploying new transparent network security
services over existing networks to enhance their protection [5].

In  the  area  of  cloud  computing  different  security  models  and
algorithms are applied at present. But these models have failed to
solve most of the security threats. Moreover for E-commerce and
different types of online businesses high capacity security models
are  implied  in  cloud  computing  fields.  Security  models  that  are
developed  and  currently  used 
the  cloud  computing
environments are mainly used for providing security for a file and
not  for  the  communication  system.  Moreover  present  security
models are  sometimes uses  secured channel  for communication.

But  this  is  not  cost  effective process.  Some  models  attempt  on
discussing about all of these but are completely dependent on user
approach. The models usually fail to use machine intelligence for
generating  key  and  newer  proposed  model.  Some  models  have
proposed  about  hardware  encryption  system  for  secured
communication  system.  The  idea  is  usually  straightforward  but
the implementation is relatively difficult. Hardware encryption is
helpful only for the database system not for other security issues.
Authenticated user detection technique is currently very important
for  ensuring  security in  cloud  computing. A  network-based  IDS
(NIDS) passively monitors traffic traversing a given network for
malicious  payloads.  NIDS  sensors  sniff  and  capture  this  traffic.
The  NIDS  analyzes  the  collected  data  to  detect  malicious
activities  and  responds  to  or  generates  reports  based  on  the
detection.  It  also  examines  the  content  of  the  network  and  the
transport layer packet  headers  and analyzes the packet  sequence
as  well  as  how  these  packets  will  affect  applications  at  the
customer endpoints. Security is broadly categorized as two types
protecting the  asset  and  protecting  the  data. In  this  research
encryption  process  is  performed  for  cloud  architecture  and
machines  act  as  network  intrusion  detction  system  and send
encrypted messages to servers in the network.

Various algorithms have been used to provide message security. It
is  good practice to  encrypt the actual  message to be transmitted
using a Symmetric key algorithm with better computational speed
for cloud environment. Firstly Advanced Encrption Standard is
used in which keys are generated randomly by the system.  AES is
a block cipher with a block length of 128 bits and also allows for
three different key lengths 128, 192 or 256 bits. AES has different
rounds  which  are  performed  for  each  block.  Except  for  the  last
round in each case all other rounds are identical. In the processing
steps  used  in  single  round  128-bit  block  is  divided  into  4  by  4
matrixes of bytes. The 4 by 4 matrix of bytes is referred to as the
state  array.  The  steps  performed  for  each  block  are  same  for
encryption  and  decryption  but  the  order  in  which  they  are
performed is different. Secondly message digest hash function is

can  be  used  in  password  handling.  for  example  the  message
content is hello how are you. Now each word is calculated and its

Append Padding Bits
Append Length
Initialize MD buffer
Process message in 16-word blocks

The  main  purpose  of  message  digest  hashing  algorithm    is  that
this  method  is  a  one  way  system  and  unbreakable.  Therefore  it
will be difficult for an unauthorized or unknown party to retrieve
the  password  for  a  selected  user  even  if  gained  access  to  the
system.

Deployment Cloud Models

 Public  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud infrastructure  is
available to the general public or a large industry group
with an internet connection.

 Private  cloud: A  private  cloud  is  established  for  a
specific  group  or  organization  and  limits  access  to  just
that group.

 Community  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud  infrastructure is
shared  among  two  or  more  organizations  that  have
similar  cloud  requirements like  security  requirements,
policy, and compliance considerations.

 Hybrid cloud: This cloud infrastructure is a combination
of  at  least  two  clouds where the  clouds  included  are  a
mixture of public, private, or community

Service Models

Cloud computing can be classified based on the services it offers.

 Infrastructure  as  a  service:  In  infrastructure  as  service
storage,  computation  and  network  resources  are  the
major components that are provided as a service to the
customer.  Customers  run  their  choice  of  operating
system and other software on the infrastructure provided
by the cloud provider.

 Platform as s service: In Platform as a service model the
cloud  provider  provides  a  platform  for  developing  and
running  the  web  based  applications.  This  platform
provides  all  the  facilities  to  support  the  complete  life
cycle of building and delivering the applications to end
users.

 Software as a service: Software as a Service is the model
in  which  an  application  is  hosted  as  a  service  to
customers who access it through the internet. When the
software is hosted off-site the customer does not have to
maintain it or support it.

Cloud Characteristics

On  demand  service:  Cloud  is  a  large  resource  and
service pool from where the service or resource can be
utilized whenever needed by paying the amount for the
service being used.

Ubiquitous  network  access:  Cloud  provides  services
everywhere  through  standard  terminal  like  mobile
phones, laptops and personal digital assistants.
Easy  use:  The  most  cloud  providers’  offers  internet
based  interfaces  which  are  simpler  than  application
program interfaces so user can easily use cloud services.
Business model: Cloud is a business model because it is
pay per use of service or resource.
Location  independent  resource  pooling:  The  providers
computing  resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple
customers  using  multitenant  model  with  different
physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and
reassigned according to demand

Modern communication is containing different types of networks depending on the behavior
of users. Cloud network and services are one of the mostly used networks. Security in the
cloud  service  architecture  is  always  a  big  concern  for  the  vendor  as  well  as  users.  In  this
paper distributed cloud service architecture is considered which is used as network detection
system for outer attacks to the cloud architecture. Outer attacks can be prevented by security
services such as McAfee, Imperva etc. but insider attacks are very difficult to detect and to
avoid them, different resources consuming processes are considered. So to provide solution
for  security  without  spending  many  resources,  encryption  of  messages  is  a  good  option.
Hash function encryption is easy and light encryption process which will challenge the odds
and can be suitable for cloud computing structures.

INTRODUCTION
At  the  present  world  of  networking  system  Cloud  computing  is
one  the  most  important  and  developing  concept  for  both  the
developers  and  the users.  Therefore  in  recent  days  providing
security in cloud has become a major challenging issue in cloud
computing. Cloud computing is primarily based on virtualization
which  enables  multi  tenancy  and  on-demand  use  of  scalable
shared resources by all tenants [3][4]. Cloud computing provides
the facility to access shared resources and common infrastructure
which offers the services on demand over the network to perform
operations  that  meet  changing  business  needs.  The  location  of
physical resources and the devices which are being accessed are
not known to the end user. It also provides facilities for users to
develop deploy and manage their applications on the cloud which
entails  virtualization  of  resources  that  maintains  and  manages
itself. Overlay  networks have  also  received  much  attention  in
recent years. Overlay networks were first used in the deployment
of the Internet over telephone networks [1]. By definition, they are
virtual networks built on top of physical networks. They consist of
virtual  nodes  connected  via  virtual  links  and  aim  to  offer
additional functionalities which are not available in the underlying
physical network [2].Because overlay networks are also based on
virtualized  nodes  for 
implementing  network  services  both
techniques  are  combined to  reap  the  benefits  of  each.  This  is
particularly useful for deploying new transparent network security
services over existing networks to enhance their protection [5].

In  the  area  of  cloud  computing  different  security  models  and
algorithms are applied at present. But these models have failed to
solve most of the security threats. Moreover for E-commerce and
different types of online businesses high capacity security models
are  implied  in  cloud  computing  fields.  Security  models  that  are
developed  and  currently  used 
the  cloud  computing
environments are mainly used for providing security for a file and
not  for  the  communication  system.  Moreover  present  security
models are  sometimes uses  secured channel  for communication.

But  this  is  not  cost  effective process.  Some  models  attempt  on
discussing about all of these but are completely dependent on user
approach. The models usually fail to use machine intelligence for
generating  key  and  newer  proposed  model.  Some  models  have
proposed  about  hardware  encryption  system  for  secured
communication  system.  The  idea  is  usually  straightforward  but
the implementation is relatively difficult. Hardware encryption is
helpful only for the database system not for other security issues.
Authenticated user detection technique is currently very important
for  ensuring  security in  cloud  computing. A  network-based  IDS
(NIDS) passively monitors traffic traversing a given network for
malicious  payloads.  NIDS  sensors  sniff  and  capture  this  traffic.
The  NIDS  analyzes  the  collected  data  to  detect  malicious
activities  and  responds  to  or  generates  reports  based  on  the
detection.  It  also  examines  the  content  of  the  network  and  the
transport layer packet  headers  and analyzes the packet  sequence
as  well  as  how  these  packets  will  affect  applications  at  the
customer endpoints. Security is broadly categorized as two types
protecting the  asset  and  protecting  the  data. In  this  research
encryption  process  is  performed  for  cloud  architecture  and
machines  act  as  network  intrusion  detction  system  and send
encrypted messages to servers in the network.

Various algorithms have been used to provide message security. It
is  good practice to  encrypt the actual  message to be transmitted
using a Symmetric key algorithm with better computational speed
for cloud environment. Firstly Advanced Encrption Standard is
used in which keys are generated randomly by the system.  AES is
a block cipher with a block length of 128 bits and also allows for
three different key lengths 128, 192 or 256 bits. AES has different
rounds  which  are  performed  for  each  block.  Except  for  the  last
round in each case all other rounds are identical. In the processing
steps  used  in  single  round  128-bit  block  is  divided  into  4  by  4
matrixes of bytes. The 4 by 4 matrix of bytes is referred to as the
state  array.  The  steps  performed  for  each  block  are  same  for
encryption  and  decryption  but  the  order  in  which  they  are
performed is different. Secondly message digest hash function is

International Journal of Recent Scientific Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 1, pp.128-132, January, 2014

used which is a cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash
value.This  hash  function  is  expressed  as  a  32-digit  hexadecimal
number.  This  algorithm  outputs  a  particular  length  string  which
can  be  used  in  password  handling.  for  example  the  message
content is hello how are you. Now each word is calculated and its
digest is produced. Lets its digest is 89 so 89 is send during the
communication. Message digest operates with following steps:

Append Padding Bits
Append Length
Initialize MD buffer
Process message in 16-word blocks
Output

The  main  purpose  of  message  digest  hashing  algorithm    is  that
this  method  is  a  one  way  system  and  unbreakable.  Therefore  it
will be difficult for an unauthorized or unknown party to retrieve
the  password  for  a  selected  user  even  if  gained  access  to  the
system.

Related Concepts about Cloud

Deployment Cloud Models

 Public  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud infrastructure  is
available to the general public or a large industry group
with an internet connection.

 Private  cloud: A  private  cloud  is  established  for  a
specific  group  or  organization  and  limits  access  to  just
that group.

 Community  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud  infrastructure is
shared  among  two  or  more  organizations  that  have
similar  cloud  requirements like  security  requirements,
policy, and compliance considerations.

 Hybrid cloud: This cloud infrastructure is a combination
of  at  least  two  clouds where the  clouds  included  are  a
mixture of public, private, or community

Service Models

Cloud computing can be classified based on the services it offers.

 Infrastructure  as  a  service:  In  infrastructure  as  service
storage,  computation  and  network  resources  are  the
major components that are provided as a service to the
customer.  Customers  run  their  choice  of  operating
system and other software on the infrastructure provided
by the cloud provider.

 Platform as s service: In Platform as a service model the
cloud  provider  provides  a  platform  for  developing  and
running  the  web  based  applications.  This  platform
provides  all  the  facilities  to  support  the  complete  life
cycle of building and delivering the applications to end
users.

 Software as a service: Software as a Service is the model
in  which  an  application  is  hosted  as  a  service  to
customers who access it through the internet. When the
software is hosted off-site the customer does not have to
maintain it or support it.

Cloud Characteristics

On  demand  service:  Cloud  is  a  large  resource  and
service pool from where the service or resource can be
utilized whenever needed by paying the amount for the
service being used.

129

Ubiquitous  network  access:  Cloud  provides  services
everywhere  through  standard  terminal  like  mobile
phones, laptops and personal digital assistants.
Easy  use:  The  most  cloud  providers’  offers  internet
based  interfaces  which  are  simpler  than  application
program interfaces so user can easily use cloud services.
Business model: Cloud is a business model because it is
pay per use of service or resource.
Location  independent  resource  pooling:  The  providers
computing  resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple
customers  using  multitenant  model  with  different
physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and
reassigned according to demand

Cloud  computing  offers  on-demand  use  of  third  party  IT
infrastructures  on  a  pay-per-use  basis.  Khaled    Salah  in  2008
discussed  that  cloud  computing  reduces  customers  need  for
hardware  while 
the  elasticity  of  computational
resources  allowing  them  to  adapt  to  business  requirements.
Therefore  businesses are  finding  it  attractive  to  adopt  the  cloud
computing  paradigm. Hassan  Takabi  explains 
that  Cloud
computing is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum
but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges.
This  explores  the  roadblocks  and  solutions  to  providing  a
trustworthy  cloud  computing  environment.
Jianyong  Chen
proposed an architecture that differentiates security  according to
service-specific characteristics avoids an unnecessary drain on IT
resources by protecting a variety of cloud computing services.
Lori M. Kaufman explained that Software as a service (SaaS) is a
well-established  cost-effective  means 
traditional
software  applications  without  investing  in  infrastructure  and
qualified  personnel.  A  natural  extension  of cloud  services  is  to
extend  platform  independence  via  virtualization  to  a  security
model.  This  paradigm  allows  for  the  distributed  provisioning  of
common  security  services.  This  model  and  its  application
demonstrate  the  viability  of  security  as  a  service for  cloud
computing.  Security  as  a  service  can  enable  cloud  customers  to
implement and maintain the protection they need in an efficient,
cost-effective  manner  that  can  be  tailored  to  meet  their  risk
profile.

Modern communication is containing different types of networks depending on the behavior
of users. Cloud network and services are one of the mostly used networks. Security in the
cloud  service  architecture  is  always  a  big  concern  for  the  vendor  as  well  as  users.  In  this
paper distributed cloud service architecture is considered which is used as network detection
system for outer attacks to the cloud architecture. Outer attacks can be prevented by security
services such as McAfee, Imperva etc. but insider attacks are very difficult to detect and to
avoid them, different resources consuming processes are considered. So to provide solution
for  security  without  spending  many  resources,  encryption  of  messages  is  a  good  option.
Hash function encryption is easy and light encryption process which will challenge the odds
and can be suitable for cloud computing structures.

INTRODUCTION
At  the  present  world  of  networking  system  Cloud  computing  is
one  the  most  important  and  developing  concept  for  both  the
developers  and  the users.  Therefore  in  recent  days  providing
security in cloud has become a major challenging issue in cloud
computing. Cloud computing is primarily based on virtualization
which  enables  multi  tenancy  and  on-demand  use  of  scalable
shared resources by all tenants [3][4]. Cloud computing provides
the facility to access shared resources and common infrastructure
which offers the services on demand over the network to perform
operations  that  meet  changing  business  needs.  The  location  of
physical resources and the devices which are being accessed are
not known to the end user. It also provides facilities for users to
develop deploy and manage their applications on the cloud which
entails  virtualization  of  resources  that  maintains  and  manages
itself. Overlay  networks have  also  received  much  attention  in
recent years. Overlay networks were first used in the deployment
of the Internet over telephone networks [1]. By definition, they are
virtual networks built on top of physical networks. They consist of
virtual  nodes  connected  via  virtual  links  and  aim  to  offer
additional functionalities which are not available in the underlying
physical network [2].Because overlay networks are also based on
virtualized  nodes  for 
implementing  network  services  both
techniques  are  combined to  reap  the  benefits  of  each.  This  is
particularly useful for deploying new transparent network security
services over existing networks to enhance their protection [5].

In  the  area  of  cloud  computing  different  security  models  and
algorithms are applied at present. But these models have failed to
solve most of the security threats. Moreover for E-commerce and
different types of online businesses high capacity security models
are  implied  in  cloud  computing  fields.  Security  models  that  are
developed  and  currently  used 
the  cloud  computing
environments are mainly used for providing security for a file and
not  for  the  communication  system.  Moreover  present  security
models are  sometimes uses  secured channel  for communication.

But  this  is  not  cost  effective process.  Some  models  attempt  on
discussing about all of these but are completely dependent on user
approach. The models usually fail to use machine intelligence for
generating  key  and  newer  proposed  model.  Some  models  have
proposed  about  hardware  encryption  system  for  secured
communication  system.  The  idea  is  usually  straightforward  but
the implementation is relatively difficult. Hardware encryption is
helpful only for the database system not for other security issues.
Authenticated user detection technique is currently very important
for  ensuring  security in  cloud  computing. A  network-based  IDS
(NIDS) passively monitors traffic traversing a given network for
malicious  payloads.  NIDS  sensors  sniff  and  capture  this  traffic.
The  NIDS  analyzes  the  collected  data  to  detect  malicious
activities  and  responds  to  or  generates  reports  based  on  the
detection.  It  also  examines  the  content  of  the  network  and  the
transport layer packet  headers  and analyzes the packet  sequence
as  well  as  how  these  packets  will  affect  applications  at  the
customer endpoints. Security is broadly categorized as two types
protecting the  asset  and  protecting  the  data. In  this  research
encryption  process  is  performed  for  cloud  architecture  and
machines  act  as  network  intrusion  detction  system  and send
encrypted messages to servers in the network.

Various algorithms have been used to provide message security. It
is  good practice to  encrypt the actual  message to be transmitted
using a Symmetric key algorithm with better computational speed
for cloud environment. Firstly Advanced Encrption Standard is
used in which keys are generated randomly by the system.  AES is
a block cipher with a block length of 128 bits and also allows for
three different key lengths 128, 192 or 256 bits. AES has different
rounds  which  are  performed  for  each  block.  Except  for  the  last
round in each case all other rounds are identical. In the processing
steps  used  in  single  round  128-bit  block  is  divided  into  4  by  4
matrixes of bytes. The 4 by 4 matrix of bytes is referred to as the
state  array.  The  steps  performed  for  each  block  are  same  for
encryption  and  decryption  but  the  order  in  which  they  are
performed is different. Secondly message digest hash function is

International Journal of Recent Scientific Research, Vol. 5, Issue, 1, pp.128-132, January, 2014

used which is a cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash
value.This  hash  function  is  expressed  as  a  32-digit  hexadecimal
number.  This  algorithm  outputs  a  particular  length  string  which
can  be  used  in  password  handling.  for  example  the  message
content is hello how are you. Now each word is calculated and its
digest is produced. Lets its digest is 89 so 89 is send during the
communication. Message digest operates with following steps:

Append Padding Bits
Append Length
Initialize MD buffer
Process message in 16-word blocks
Output

The  main  purpose  of  message  digest  hashing  algorithm    is  that
this  method  is  a  one  way  system  and  unbreakable.  Therefore  it
will be difficult for an unauthorized or unknown party to retrieve
the  password  for  a  selected  user  even  if  gained  access  to  the
system.

Related Concepts about Cloud

Deployment Cloud Models

 Public  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud infrastructure  is
available to the general public or a large industry group
with an internet connection.

 Private  cloud: A  private  cloud  is  established  for  a
specific  group  or  organization  and  limits  access  to  just
that group.

 Community  cloud:  This  type  of  cloud  infrastructure is
shared  among  two  or  more  organizations  that  have
similar  cloud  requirements like  security  requirements,
policy, and compliance considerations.

 Hybrid cloud: This cloud infrastructure is a combination
of  at  least  two  clouds where the  clouds  included  are  a
mixture of public, private, or community

Service Models

Cloud computing can be classified based on the services it offers.

 Infrastructure  as  a  service:  In  infrastructure  as  service
storage,  computation  and  network  resources  are  the
major components that are provided as a service to the
customer.  Customers  run  their  choice  of  operating
system and other software on the infrastructure provided
by the cloud provider.

 Platform as s service: In Platform as a service model the
cloud  provider  provides  a  platform  for  developing  and
running  the  web  based  applications.  This  platform
provides  all  the  facilities  to  support  the  complete  life
cycle of building and delivering the applications to end
users.

 Software as a service: Software as a Service is the model
in  which  an  application  is  hosted  as  a  service  to
customers who access it through the internet. When the
software is hosted off-site the customer does not have to
maintain it or support it.

Cloud Characteristics

On  demand  service:  Cloud  is  a  large  resource  and
service pool from where the service or resource can be
utilized whenever needed by paying the amount for the
service being used.

129

Ubiquitous  network  access:  Cloud  provides  services
everywhere  through  standard  terminal  like  mobile
phones, laptops and personal digital assistants.
Easy  use:  The  most  cloud  providers’  offers  internet
based  interfaces  which  are  simpler  than  application
program interfaces so user can easily use cloud services.
Business model: Cloud is a business model because it is
pay per use of service or resource.
Location  independent  resource  pooling:  The  providers
computing  resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple
customers  using  multitenant  model  with  different
physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and
reassigned according to demand

Cloud  computing  offers  on-demand  use  of  third  party  IT
infrastructures  on  a  pay-per-use  basis.  Khaled    Salah  in  2008
discussed  that  cloud  computing  reduces  customers  need  for
hardware  while 
the  elasticity  of  computational
resources  allowing  them  to  adapt  to  business  requirements.
Therefore  businesses are  finding  it  attractive  to  adopt  the  cloud
computing  paradigm. Hassan  Takabi  explains 
that  Cloud
computing is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum
but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges.
This  explores  the  roadblocks  and  solutions  to  providing  a
trustworthy  cloud  computing  environment.
Jianyong  Chen
proposed an architecture that differentiates security  according to
service-specific characteristics avoids an unnecessary drain on IT
resources by protecting a variety of cloud computing services.
Lori M. Kaufman explained that Software as a service (SaaS) is a
well-established  cost-effective  means 
traditional
software  applications  without  investing  in  infrastructure  and
qualified  personnel.  A  natural  extension  of cloud  services  is  to
extend  platform  independence  via  virtualization  to  a  security
model.  This  paradigm  allows  for  the  distributed  provisioning  of
common  security  services.  This  model  and  its  application
demonstrate  the  viability  of  security  as  a  service for  cloud
computing.  Security  as  a  service  can  enable  cloud  customers  to
implement and maintain the protection they need in an efficient,
cost-effective  manner  that  can  be  tailored  to  meet  their  risk
profile.

To  save  message  from  been  attacked  a  well  known  hashing
algorithm Message Digest level 5 is used for hashing along with
advanced  encryption  standard  for  the web  log  messages. The
performance of network is judged on the basis of variation of web
log queries with respect to CPU utilization. Hash function shown
in  figure  5  shows  successful  hashed  functioned  data  messages.
Below  is  the  server  configuration  received  from  clients  in
encrypted form. The graph shown compares all the ciphers based
on  their  throughput.  Again  RC4  tops  as  it  do  encryption  of
maximum data in minimum time. The hybrid approach is better
than all other ciphers.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work the security of the cloud architecture was the focused
part. To provide better security in cloud architecture encryption in
form of hashing function is provided to the messages which are
been transferred from various client machine to server machines
in the cloud infrastructure. The useful concept of hashing has been
done  for  preventing 
in  cloud  service
architecture.  In  future  it  is  very  interesting  to test  various  other
encryption  techniques  such  as  Rivest  cipher,  DES  etc  for  better
security  concerns  for  cloud  architecture.  Further  we  can  also
compare security features under various attacks in cloud services.
