Abstract 

We  live  in  a  knowledge-based  information  society  where  a  new  technology  emerges 
overnight and new information is produced every day. Our current shift towards a more 
digital  world  has  led  to  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  use  of  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  in  education.  With  the  development  of  innovative 
technology,  educational  content,  methods  of  teaching  and  learning,  educational 
environments,  and  the  roles  of  teachers  and  schools  can  be  changed.  However,  despite 
numerous efforts to improve educational standards, school systems around the world are 
struggling  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  21st  century  learners  and  employers.  Climate 
change has also affected education. Therefore, the need for learning – and the way people 
learn – is changing faster than before. The paradigm shift to a world of the 21st century 
learning  is  rooted  in  a  set  of  goals  for  all  learners.  SMART  education  is  a  creativity-
focused,  customized  system  for  developing  new  ways  to  learn  by  using  up-to-date 
technology  like  cloud  computing,  and  enables  students    to  study  with  various  materials 
based on their aptitudes and intellectual levels using mobile Digital Textbook at anytime, 
anywhere and on any devices. This paper examines various ways of content development 
for  digital  textbook,  service  provision,  and  service  delivery,  and  suggests  the  most 
suitable model in a cloud computing environment in order to  propose a suitable service 
model for Digital Textbook in the cloud computing environment.

With  the  growing  demands  of  society  and  the  increasing  uses  of  technology  in  our

educational  approaches  are  based  on  a  teacher-centered  model  where  information  and 
knowledge flow in one direction from teachers to students. This one direction approach 
is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th 
in  education  competitiveness  globally,  according  to  a  survey  facilitated  by  the 
International  Institute for Management Development (IMD). However, according 
to statistics by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Korean 
students  are  performing  at  the  highest  level  of  achievement.  As  an  alternative  to 
replace  the  current  educational  system  in  an  industrial  society,  proposing  SMART 
education  is  a  global  trend  and  policy.  In  Finland,  a  customized  education  system  has 
already been built and has provided students with an up-to-date educational environment 
using  ICT  in  education.  Recently,  South  Korea  ranked  first  among  19  countries  in  the 
2009  Digital  Reading  Assessment  for  students’  problem  solving  capacity  using  the 
Internet,  this  data  was  also  included  in  PISA.  It  was  an  outstanding  achievement 
considering  that  the  students  were  high-school  students  preoccupied  with  college 
preparation.  It  proved  that  advanced  ICT  development  in  Korea,  can  contribute  to 
reducing the information gap, rather than widening education inequality.  Therefore, it is 
the opportune time to shift toward Smart education in order to prepare for our children's 
future.  

To  attain  the  vision  of  SMART  education,  the  Korean  government  has  initiated  five 
flagship  projects.  These  five  projects  are  1)Digital  Textbook  development  and 
application;  2)  promoting  online  classes  and  assessments;  3)creating  an  environment  to 
use  educational  content  safely;  4)building  teacher’s  competency;  and  5)establishing  a 
cloud-based  education  system.  Through  the  implementation  of  these  five  main  projects, 
diverse types of educational content will allow students to learn whenever and wherever 
they please.  As students will have access to these resources through all smart devices—
PCs,  laptops,  smart  tabs,  tablet  PCs,  and  smart  TVs,  they  can  learn  at  their  own 
convenience.  
 
2. Backgrounds 
 
2.1. The Definition of SMART Education 

SMART Education stands for “Self-directed, Motivated, Adapted,  Resource enriched, 
Technology-embedded”.  First,  “Self-directed”  characterizes  the  change  in  students  roles 
as  recipients  to  producers  of  knowledge  and  the  shift  of  teachers  from  deliverers  of 
knowledge to learning assistants(mentors). To achieve this, online assessments, academic 
performance  evaluations,  and  a  self-directed  learning  system  will  also  be  implemented. 
Second,  “Motivated”  highlights  the  way  in  which  SMART  education  will  encourage 
students to take interest in learning. SMART Education emphasizes teaching and learning 
methods  that  promotes  creative  problem-solving  and  process  -centered  individualized 
assessment. Students' learning experiences will be transformed from the typical textbook-
based to experience-based. Third, “Adapted” stands for the pursing of education through a 
customized educational system and a customized teaching and learning system. SMART 
Education strengthens the flexibility of the educational system and facilitates customized 
learning in connection with personal interests and future career aspirations. It also helps 
schools evolve from a place of delivering knowledge to a place that supports personalized 
learning  according  to  students’  levels  and  aptitudes.  Fourth,  “Resource  enriched” 
describes the support for rich teaching-learning materials. From a cloud learning service, 
SMART Education provides free access to  rich contents developed by public and private 
institutions and individuals in education, expands the joint use of domestic and overseas 
learning  resources,  and  promotes  collaborative  learning  through  the  contents  delivery

platforms. Fifth, “Technology-embedded” illustrates the use of the latest information and 
communications technology. SMART Education enables students to learn at anytime and 
anywhere  through  information  technology.  By  building  an  educational  environment  that 
encourages  student-centered  learning,  students  are  provided  with  diverse  methods  of 
learning tailored to self-selected areas of interest [2]. 

Figure 1. Steps of SMART Education 

 

SMART  Education  is  an  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  education.  Starting  in  the 
1990’s  implemented  since  in  the  early  1990s,  e-Learning  expanded  through  the 
introduction of LMS, and u-learning implemented through the introduction of ubiquitous 
technologies.  It  is  also  institutionalized  application  of  ICT  to  education  as  an  essential 
means of a future educational paradigm for the 21st century. 
 
2.2. Digital Textbook 

The  enormous  amounts  of  digital  information  that  we  produce  equates  to  1.8  zetta-
bytes  (180  trillion  gigabytes),  which  means  that  one  person  can  watch  a  two-hour  HD 
movie  for  47  million  years.  This  amount  of  information  consistently  increases  by  more 
than  double  every  two  years  while  a  cycle  of  information  exchange  is  also  shortening. 
Furthermore, traditional paper-based textbooks are quickly becoming outdated soon after 
they are published. 

The  Digital  Textbook  is  a  future-oriented  textbook  that  can  help  students  learn  in  a 
self-directed  manner  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  includes  learning  aids,  workbooks,  a 
dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

knowledge to learning assistants(mentors). To achieve this, online assessments, academic 
performance  evaluations,  and  a  self-directed  learning  system  will  also  be  implemented. 
Second,  “Motivated”  highlights  the  way  in  which  SMART  education  will  encourage 
students to take interest in learning. SMART Education emphasizes teaching and learning 
methods  that  promotes  creative  problem-solving  and  process  -centered  individualized 
assessment. Students' learning experiences will be transformed from the typical textbook-
based to experience-based. Third, “Adapted” stands for the pursing of education through a 
customized educational system and a customized teaching and learning system. SMART 
Education strengthens the flexibility of the educational system and facilitates customized 
learning in connection with personal interests and future career aspirations. It also helps 
schools evolve from a place of delivering knowledge to a place that supports personalized 
learning  according  to  students’  levels  and  aptitudes.  Fourth,  “Resource  enriched” 
describes the support for rich teaching-learning materials. From a cloud learning service, 
SMART Education provides free access to  rich contents developed by public and private 
institutions and individuals in education, expands the joint use of domestic and overseas 
learning  resources,  and  promotes  collaborative  learning  through  the  contents  delivery

platforms. Fifth, “Technology-embedded” illustrates the use of the latest information and 
communications technology. SMART Education enables students to learn at anytime and 
anywhere  through  information  technology.  By  building  an  educational  environment  that 
encourages  student-centered  learning,  students  are  provided  with  diverse  methods  of 
learning tailored to self-selected areas of interest [2]. 

Figure 1. Steps of SMART Education 

 

SMART  Education  is  an  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  education.  Starting  in  the 
1990’s  implemented  since  in  the  early  1990s,  e-Learning  expanded  through  the 
introduction of LMS, and u-learning implemented through the introduction of ubiquitous 
technologies.  It  is  also  institutionalized  application  of  ICT  to  education  as  an  essential 
means of a future educational paradigm for the 21st century. 
 
2.2. Digital Textbook 

The  enormous  amounts  of  digital  information  that  we  produce  equates  to  1.8  zetta-
bytes  (180  trillion  gigabytes),  which  means  that  one  person  can  watch  a  two-hour  HD 
movie  for  47  million  years.  This  amount  of  information  consistently  increases  by  more 
than  double  every  two  years  while  a  cycle  of  information  exchange  is  also  shortening. 
Furthermore, traditional paper-based textbooks are quickly becoming outdated soon after 
they are published. 

The  Digital  Textbook  is  a  future-oriented  textbook  that  can  help  students  learn  in  a 
self-directed  manner  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  includes  learning  aids,  workbooks,  a 
dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

Digital  textbooks  provide  educational  content  through  multimedia  such  as  videos, 
animations, and virtual reality.  They also have interactive functions  that implemented to 
enable learners to learn according to their aptitudes, abilities, and levels. As illustrated in 
Figure 3, in order to assist with the use of digital textbooks, current digital textbooks have 
been designed to mirror the format of paper textbooks.

As  for  the  document  format,  Digital  Textbooks  manage  PDF  image  files  based  on 
XML and apply the SCORM standard to the object of content. The platforms of Digital 
Textbooks  are  developed  to  support  various  operating  system  such  as  Windows,  open 
software  Linux  for  PC,  and  iOS,  open  software  Android  for  smart  device[4].  Digital 
Textbooks consist of 10 detailed functions, such as, viewing, assistive tools, multimedia, 
search, etc (Table 1).

Abstract 

We  live  in  a  knowledge-based  information  society  where  a  new  technology  emerges 
overnight and new information is produced every day. Our current shift towards a more 
digital  world  has  led  to  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  use  of  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  in  education.  With  the  development  of  innovative 
technology,  educational  content,  methods  of  teaching  and  learning,  educational 
environments,  and  the  roles  of  teachers  and  schools  can  be  changed.  However,  despite 
numerous efforts to improve educational standards, school systems around the world are 
struggling  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  21st  century  learners  and  employers.  Climate 
change has also affected education. Therefore, the need for learning – and the way people 
learn – is changing faster than before. The paradigm shift to a world of the 21st century 
learning  is  rooted  in  a  set  of  goals  for  all  learners.  SMART  education  is  a  creativity-
focused,  customized  system  for  developing  new  ways  to  learn  by  using  up-to-date 
technology  like  cloud  computing,  and  enables  students    to  study  with  various  materials 
based on their aptitudes and intellectual levels using mobile Digital Textbook at anytime, 
anywhere and on any devices. This paper examines various ways of content development 
for  digital  textbook,  service  provision,  and  service  delivery,  and  suggests  the  most 
suitable model in a cloud computing environment in order to  propose a suitable service 
model for Digital Textbook in the cloud computing environment.

1. Introduction  

The emergence of Digital Natives has led to changes in communication methods, forms 
of  knowledge,  and  the  ways  in  which  collective  intelligence  is  cultivated  for  social 
productivity.  These  radical  changes  in  the  environment  are  demanding  reform  in 
education. Similar to the way in which modern schooling systems had replaced agrarian 
education,  to  meet  societal  demands  for  a  skilled  labor  force,  our  knowledge-based 
society  also  calls  for  changes  in  the  education  system.  In  short,  there  is  a  need  for  a 
radical  paradigm  shift  from  the  present  industrial  approach  to  education  to  one  that 
supports the rising knowledge-based information society [1].  

With  the  growing  demands  of  society  and  the  increasing  uses  of  technology  in  our 
daily  lives,  new  generations  of  the  21st  century  will  require  an  education  system  that 
attends  to  both  needs.  One  strategy,  that  can  lead  this  reform  is  SMART  education. 
SMART education can be defined as an educational system that allows students to learn 
by  using  up-to-date  technology  and  it  enables  students  to  study  with  various  materials 
based  on  their  aptitudes  and  intellectual  levels.  The  difference  between  the  current 
education system and SMART education is similar to the difference between regular cell 
phones and smart phones; while regular phones have programs and systems supplied by 
manufacturers,  smart  phones  can  be  customized  to  meet  the  users’  needs.  Current

educational  approaches  are  based  on  a  teacher-centered  model  where  information  and 
knowledge flow in one direction from teachers to students. This one direction approach 
is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th 
in  education  competitiveness  globally,  according  to  a  survey  facilitated  by  the 
International  Institute for Management Development (IMD). However, according 
to statistics by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Korean 
students  are  performing  at  the  highest  level  of  achievement.  As  an  alternative  to 
replace  the  current  educational  system  in  an  industrial  society,  proposing  SMART 
education  is  a  global  trend  and  policy.  In  Finland,  a  customized  education  system  has 
already been built and has provided students with an up-to-date educational environment 
using  ICT  in  education.  Recently,  South  Korea  ranked  first  among  19  countries  in  the 
2009  Digital  Reading  Assessment  for  students’  problem  solving  capacity  using  the 
Internet,  this  data  was  also  included  in  PISA.  It  was  an  outstanding  achievement 
considering  that  the  students  were  high-school  students  preoccupied  with  college 
preparation.  It  proved  that  advanced  ICT  development  in  Korea,  can  contribute  to 
reducing the information gap, rather than widening education inequality.  Therefore, it is 
the opportune time to shift toward Smart education in order to prepare for our children's 
future.  

To  attain  the  vision  of  SMART  education,  the  Korean  government  has  initiated  five 
flagship  projects.  These  five  projects  are  1)Digital  Textbook  development  and 
application;  2)  promoting  online  classes  and  assessments;  3)creating  an  environment  to 
use  educational  content  safely;  4)building  teacher’s  competency;  and  5)establishing  a 
cloud-based  education  system.  Through  the  implementation  of  these  five  main  projects, 
diverse types of educational content will allow students to learn whenever and wherever 
they please.  As students will have access to these resources through all smart devices—
PCs,  laptops,  smart  tabs,  tablet  PCs,  and  smart  TVs,  they  can  learn  at  their  own 
convenience.

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

2.3. Cloud Computing  

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

Cloud computing providers offer their services based on three fundamental models:[8, 
9]  Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  and  software  as  a 
service(SaaS) IaaS is the most basic and each higher model abstracts from the details of 
the lower models (Figure 4).  

First, in the Iaas model, cloud providers offer computers, as physical or more often as 
virtual machines, and other resources. Second, in the PaaS model, cloud providers deliver 
a  computing  platform  typically  including  operating  system,  programming  language 
execution  environment,  database,  and  web  server.  Finally,  in  the  SasS  model,  cloud 
providers  install  and  operate  application  software  in  the  cloud,  while  cloud  users  get 
access  to  the  software  from  cloud  clients.  The  cloud  users  do  not  manage  the  cloud 
infrastructure and platform on which the application is running. This eliminates the need 
to  install  and  run  the  application  on  the  cloud  user's  own  computers  simplifying 
maintenance  and  support.  Cloud  computing  can  give  us  benefits  to  reduce  the  cost  of 
replacing  hardware  that  has  long  been  viewed  as  flawed,  concentrate  on  managing 
licenses, make it easier to provide software(Figure 5), and expect to have superior security.

Abstract 

We  live  in  a  knowledge-based  information  society  where  a  new  technology  emerges 
overnight and new information is produced every day. Our current shift towards a more 
digital  world  has  led  to  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  use  of  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  in  education.  With  the  development  of  innovative 
technology,  educational  content,  methods  of  teaching  and  learning,  educational 
environments,  and  the  roles  of  teachers  and  schools  can  be  changed.  However,  despite 
numerous efforts to improve educational standards, school systems around the world are 
struggling  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  21st  century  learners  and  employers.  Climate 
change has also affected education. Therefore, the need for learning – and the way people 
learn – is changing faster than before. The paradigm shift to a world of the 21st century 
learning  is  rooted  in  a  set  of  goals  for  all  learners.  SMART  education  is  a  creativity-
focused,  customized  system  for  developing  new  ways  to  learn  by  using  up-to-date 
technology  like  cloud  computing,  and  enables  students    to  study  with  various  materials 
based on their aptitudes and intellectual levels using mobile Digital Textbook at anytime, 
anywhere and on any devices. This paper examines various ways of content development 
for  digital  textbook,  service  provision,  and  service  delivery,  and  suggests  the  most 
suitable model in a cloud computing environment in order to  propose a suitable service 
model for Digital Textbook in the cloud computing environment.

1. Introduction  

The emergence of Digital Natives has led to changes in communication methods, forms 
of  knowledge,  and  the  ways  in  which  collective  intelligence  is  cultivated  for  social 
productivity.  These  radical  changes  in  the  environment  are  demanding  reform  in 
education. Similar to the way in which modern schooling systems had replaced agrarian 
education,  to  meet  societal  demands  for  a  skilled  labor  force,  our  knowledge-based 
society  also  calls  for  changes  in  the  education  system.  In  short,  there  is  a  need  for  a 
radical  paradigm  shift  from  the  present  industrial  approach  to  education  to  one  that 
supports the rising knowledge-based information society [1].  

With  the  growing  demands  of  society  and  the  increasing  uses  of  technology  in  our 
daily  lives,  new  generations  of  the  21st  century  will  require  an  education  system  that 
attends  to  both  needs.  One  strategy,  that  can  lead  this  reform  is  SMART  education. 
SMART education can be defined as an educational system that allows students to learn 
by  using  up-to-date  technology  and  it  enables  students  to  study  with  various  materials 
based  on  their  aptitudes  and  intellectual  levels.  The  difference  between  the  current 
education system and SMART education is similar to the difference between regular cell 
phones and smart phones; while regular phones have programs and systems supplied by 
manufacturers,  smart  phones  can  be  customized  to  meet  the  users’  needs.  Current

educational  approaches  are  based  on  a  teacher-centered  model  where  information  and 
knowledge flow in one direction from teachers to students. This one direction approach 
is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th 
in  education  competitiveness  globally,  according  to  a  survey  facilitated  by  the 
International  Institute for Management Development (IMD). However, according 
to statistics by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Korean 
students  are  performing  at  the  highest  level  of  achievement.  As  an  alternative  to 
replace  the  current  educational  system  in  an  industrial  society,  proposing  SMART 
education  is  a  global  trend  and  policy.  In  Finland,  a  customized  education  system  has 
already been built and has provided students with an up-to-date educational environment 
using  ICT  in  education.  Recently,  South  Korea  ranked  first  among  19  countries  in  the 
2009  Digital  Reading  Assessment  for  students’  problem  solving  capacity  using  the 
Internet,  this  data  was  also  included  in  PISA.  It  was  an  outstanding  achievement 
considering  that  the  students  were  high-school  students  preoccupied  with  college 
preparation.  It  proved  that  advanced  ICT  development  in  Korea,  can  contribute  to 
reducing the information gap, rather than widening education inequality.  Therefore, it is 
the opportune time to shift toward Smart education in order to prepare for our children's 
future.  

To  attain  the  vision  of  SMART  education,  the  Korean  government  has  initiated  five 
flagship  projects.  These  five  projects  are  1)Digital  Textbook  development  and 
application;  2)  promoting  online  classes  and  assessments;  3)creating  an  environment  to 
use  educational  content  safely;  4)building  teacher’s  competency;  and  5)establishing  a 
cloud-based  education  system.  Through  the  implementation  of  these  five  main  projects, 
diverse types of educational content will allow students to learn whenever and wherever 
they please.  As students will have access to these resources through all smart devices—
PCs,  laptops,  smart  tabs,  tablet  PCs,  and  smart  TVs,  they  can  learn  at  their  own 
convenience.  
 
2. Backgrounds 
 
2.1. The Definition of SMART Education 

SMART Education stands for “Self-directed, Motivated, Adapted,  Resource enriched, 
Technology-embedded”.  First,  “Self-directed”  characterizes  the  change  in  students  roles 
as  recipients  to  producers  of  knowledge  and  the  shift  of  teachers  from  deliverers  of 
knowledge to learning assistants(mentors). To achieve this, online assessments, academic 
performance  evaluations,  and  a  self-directed  learning  system  will  also  be  implemented. 
Second,  “Motivated”  highlights  the  way  in  which  SMART  education  will  encourage 
students to take interest in learning. SMART Education emphasizes teaching and learning 
methods  that  promotes  creative  problem-solving  and  process  -centered  individualized 
assessment. Students' learning experiences will be transformed from the typical textbook-
based to experience-based. Third, “Adapted” stands for the pursing of education through a 
customized educational system and a customized teaching and learning system. SMART 
Education strengthens the flexibility of the educational system and facilitates customized 
learning in connection with personal interests and future career aspirations. It also helps 
schools evolve from a place of delivering knowledge to a place that supports personalized 
learning  according  to  students’  levels  and  aptitudes.  Fourth,  “Resource  enriched” 
describes the support for rich teaching-learning materials. From a cloud learning service, 
SMART Education provides free access to  rich contents developed by public and private 
institutions and individuals in education, expands the joint use of domestic and overseas 
learning  resources,  and  promotes  collaborative  learning  through  the  contents  delivery

platforms. Fifth, “Technology-embedded” illustrates the use of the latest information and 
communications technology. SMART Education enables students to learn at anytime and 
anywhere  through  information  technology.  By  building  an  educational  environment  that 
encourages  student-centered  learning,  students  are  provided  with  diverse  methods  of 
learning tailored to self-selected areas of interest [2]. 

Figure 1. Steps of SMART Education 

 

SMART  Education  is  an  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  education.  Starting  in  the 
1990’s  implemented  since  in  the  early  1990s,  e-Learning  expanded  through  the 
introduction of LMS, and u-learning implemented through the introduction of ubiquitous 
technologies.  It  is  also  institutionalized  application  of  ICT  to  education  as  an  essential 
means of a future educational paradigm for the 21st century. 
 
2.2. Digital Textbook 

The  enormous  amounts  of  digital  information  that  we  produce  equates  to  1.8  zetta-
bytes  (180  trillion  gigabytes),  which  means  that  one  person  can  watch  a  two-hour  HD 
movie  for  47  million  years.  This  amount  of  information  consistently  increases  by  more 
than  double  every  two  years  while  a  cycle  of  information  exchange  is  also  shortening. 
Furthermore, traditional paper-based textbooks are quickly becoming outdated soon after 
they are published. 

The  Digital  Textbook  is  a  future-oriented  textbook  that  can  help  students  learn  in  a 
self-directed  manner  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  includes  learning  aids,  workbooks,  a 
dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

Textbooks  are  developed  to  support  various  operating  system  such  as  Windows,  open 
software  Linux  for  PC,  and  iOS,  open  software  Android  for  smart  device[4].  Digital

2.3. Cloud Computing  

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

the lower models (Figure 4).  

First, in the Iaas model, cloud providers offer computers, as physical or more often as 
virtual machines, and other resources. Second, in the PaaS model, cloud providers deliver 
a  computing  platform  typically  including  operating  system,  programming  language

replacing  hardware  that  has  long  been  viewed  as  flawed,  concentrate  on  managing 
licenses, make it easier to provide software(Figure 5), and expect to have superior security.

3. Service Model of Digital Textbook in Cloud Computing Environment 
 
3.1. Types of Content Development  

There  are  three  general  types  of  content  development  for  Digital  Textbooks: 
single packaging type, HTML and CSS-based browser type, and content plus viewer type, 
which  embeds  exclusive  player  or  viewer  in  the  application  itself  such  as  Figure  6[10]. 
The first type of content development, single packaging, is the most general development 
method  in  which  the  application  itself  becomes  the  content  by  including  metadata  of 
content in the application. As data are processed inside the application, this type is fast in 
response  speed  and  easy  to  develop,  but  it  is  difficult  to  update.  Therefore,  single 
packaging  is  suitable  for  games  or  unilateral  information  delivery  services.  The  second 
type  of  content  development,  browser  type,  is  a  commonly  used  method  of  Web-based 
content  development  suited  for  portal,  news,  and  advertisement  services.  This  type  is 
compatible  with  multi  platforms,  but  response  speed  is  slow.  The  last  type  of  content 
development, content plus viewer type, is used to implement content by embedding it in a 
player or viewer dedicated to content. This development method is suitable for providing 
service such as film or music and content service such as e-Books.  
 

(a)  Single Packaging                  (b) CSS-based Browser            (c) Contents plus 

 

viewer 

Figure 6. Types of Contents Development 

As  Digital  Textbooks  feature  easy  development  of  content  in  the  unified  format  and 
easy  application  of  paper  and  multimedia  materials,  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently 
developed using the content plus viewer type development. This type can be proposed as 
the most suitable method of content development in the future cloud environment as well.  

 

3.2. Ways of Service Provision 

The  methods  of  providing  Digital  Textbook  service  can  be  classified  by  four  ways: 
native,  mobile,  Web, and hybrid  applications  such as  Figure  7.  In  the  native  application 
setting,  students  can  immediately  use  the  Digital  Textbook  embedded  in  the  application 
regardless of network access. Also, as this model has a high usage of device function, it is 
possible to implement the Digital Textbook which enables learning offline based on easy 
application  of  various  types  of  content,  fast  speed  and  high  performance.  However,  as 
native  application  depends  heavily  on  devices,  it  has  weaknesses  of  additional 
development for each OS and high development cost. Mobile Web is a method of storing 
all data and applications in the Internet server and transmitting in HTML when users get 
access to the server through the browser. Despite its slow speed, this type can be used in 
all  devices  with  one  single  application.  Web  application  is  a  method  of  providing  Web 
services  through  App  calls  embedded  in  the  server.  It  is  easy  to  develop  and  has  a  low

phones and smart phones; while regular phones have programs and systems supplied by 
manufacturers,  smart  phones  can  be  customized  to  meet  the  users’  needs.  Current

educational  approaches  are  based  on  a  teacher-centered  model  where  information  and 
knowledge flow in one direction from teachers to students. This one direction approach 
is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th 
in  education  competitiveness  globally,  according  to  a  survey  facilitated  by  the 
International  Institute for Management Development (IMD). However, according 
to statistics by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Korean 
students  are  performing  at  the  highest  level  of  achievement.  As  an  alternative  to 
replace  the  current  educational  system  in  an  industrial  society,  proposing  SMART 
education  is  a  global  trend  and  policy.  In  Finland,  a  customized  education  system  has 
already been built and has provided students with an up-to-date educational environment 
using  ICT  in  education.  Recently,  South  Korea  ranked  first  among  19  countries  in  the 
2009  Digital  Reading  Assessment  for  students’  problem  solving  capacity  using  the 
Internet,  this  data  was  also  included  in  PISA.  It  was  an  outstanding  achievement 
considering  that  the  students  were  high-school  students  preoccupied  with  college 
preparation.  It  proved  that  advanced  ICT  development  in  Korea,  can  contribute  to 
reducing the information gap, rather than widening education inequality.  Therefore, it is 
the opportune time to shift toward Smart education in order to prepare for our children's 
future.  

To  attain  the  vision  of  SMART  education,  the  Korean  government  has  initiated  five 
flagship  projects.  These  five  projects  are  1)Digital  Textbook  development  and 
application;  2)  promoting  online  classes  and  assessments;  3)creating  an  environment  to 
use  educational  content  safely;  4)building  teacher’s  competency;  and  5)establishing  a 
cloud-based  education  system.  Through  the  implementation  of  these  five  main  projects, 
diverse types of educational content will allow students to learn whenever and wherever 
they please.  As students will have access to these resources through all smart devices—
PCs,  laptops,  smart  tabs,  tablet  PCs,  and  smart  TVs,  they  can  learn  at  their  own 
convenience.  
 
2. Backgrounds 
 
2.1. The Definition of SMART Education 

SMART Education stands for “Self-directed, Motivated, Adapted,  Resource enriched, 
Technology-embedded”.  First,  “Self-directed”  characterizes  the  change  in  students  roles 
as  recipients  to  producers  of  knowledge  and  the  shift  of  teachers  from  deliverers  of 
knowledge to learning assistants(mentors). To achieve this, online assessments, academic 
performance  evaluations,  and  a  self-directed  learning  system  will  also  be  implemented. 
Second,  “Motivated”  highlights  the  way  in  which  SMART  education  will  encourage 
students to take interest in learning. SMART Education emphasizes teaching and learning 
methods  that  promotes  creative  problem-solving  and  process  -centered  individualized 
assessment. Students' learning experiences will be transformed from the typical textbook-
based to experience-based. Third, “Adapted” stands for the pursing of education through a 
customized educational system and a customized teaching and learning system. SMART 
Education strengthens the flexibility of the educational system and facilitates customized 
learning in connection with personal interests and future career aspirations. It also helps 
schools evolve from a place of delivering knowledge to a place that supports personalized 
learning  according  to  students’  levels  and  aptitudes.  Fourth,  “Resource  enriched” 
describes the support for rich teaching-learning materials. From a cloud learning service, 
SMART Education provides free access to  rich contents developed by public and private 
institutions and individuals in education, expands the joint use of domestic and overseas 
learning  resources,  and  promotes  collaborative  learning  through  the  contents  delivery

platforms. Fifth, “Technology-embedded” illustrates the use of the latest information and 
communications technology. SMART Education enables students to learn at anytime and 
anywhere  through  information  technology.  By  building  an  educational  environment  that 
encourages  student-centered  learning,  students  are  provided  with  diverse  methods  of 
learning tailored to self-selected areas of interest [2]. 

Figure 1. Steps of SMART Education 

 

SMART  Education  is  an  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  education.  Starting  in  the 
1990’s  implemented  since  in  the  early  1990s,  e-Learning  expanded  through  the 
introduction of LMS, and u-learning implemented through the introduction of ubiquitous 
technologies.  It  is  also  institutionalized  application  of  ICT  to  education  as  an  essential 
means of a future educational paradigm for the 21st century. 
 
2.2. Digital Textbook 

The  enormous  amounts  of  digital  information  that  we  produce  equates  to  1.8  zetta-
bytes  (180  trillion  gigabytes),  which  means  that  one  person  can  watch  a  two-hour  HD 
movie  for  47  million  years.  This  amount  of  information  consistently  increases  by  more 
than  double  every  two  years  while  a  cycle  of  information  exchange  is  also  shortening. 
Furthermore, traditional paper-based textbooks are quickly becoming outdated soon after 
they are published. 

The  Digital  Textbook  is  a  future-oriented  textbook  that  can  help  students  learn  in  a 
self-directed  manner  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  includes  learning  aids,  workbooks,  a 
dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

Digital  textbooks  provide  educational  content  through  multimedia  such  as  videos, 
animations, and virtual reality.  They also have interactive functions  that implemented to 
enable learners to learn according to their aptitudes, abilities, and levels. As illustrated in 
Figure 3, in order to assist with the use of digital textbooks, current digital textbooks have 
been designed to mirror the format of paper textbooks.

School, 2nd Grade) 

 

As  for  the  document  format,  Digital  Textbooks  manage  PDF  image  files  based  on 
XML and apply the SCORM standard to the object of content. The platforms of Digital 
Textbooks  are  developed  to  support  various  operating  system  such  as  Windows,  open 
software  Linux  for  PC,  and  iOS,  open  software  Android  for  smart  device[4].  Digital 
Textbooks consist of 10 detailed functions, such as, viewing, assistive tools, multimedia, 
search, etc (Table 1).

2.3. Cloud Computing  

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

Figure 4. Cloud Computing Layers 

 

Cloud computing providers offer their services based on three fundamental models:[8, 
9]  Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  and  software  as  a 
service(SaaS) IaaS is the most basic and each higher model abstracts from the details of 
the lower models (Figure 4).  

First, in the Iaas model, cloud providers offer computers, as physical or more often as 
virtual machines, and other resources. Second, in the PaaS model, cloud providers deliver 
a  computing  platform  typically  including  operating  system,  programming  language 
execution  environment,  database,  and  web  server.  Finally,  in  the  SasS  model,  cloud 
providers  install  and  operate  application  software  in  the  cloud,  while  cloud  users  get 
access  to  the  software  from  cloud  clients.  The  cloud  users  do  not  manage  the  cloud 
infrastructure and platform on which the application is running. This eliminates the need 
to  install  and  run  the  application  on  the  cloud  user's  own  computers  simplifying 
maintenance  and  support.  Cloud  computing  can  give  us  benefits  to  reduce  the  cost  of 
replacing  hardware  that  has  long  been  viewed  as  flawed,  concentrate  on  managing 
licenses, make it easier to provide software(Figure 5), and expect to have superior security.

3. Service Model of Digital Textbook in Cloud Computing Environment 
 
3.1. Types of Content Development  

There  are  three  general  types  of  content  development  for  Digital  Textbooks: 
single packaging type, HTML and CSS-based browser type, and content plus viewer type, 
which  embeds  exclusive  player  or  viewer  in  the  application  itself  such  as  Figure  6[10]. 
The first type of content development, single packaging, is the most general development 
method  in  which  the  application  itself  becomes  the  content  by  including  metadata  of 
content in the application. As data are processed inside the application, this type is fast in 
response  speed  and  easy  to  develop,  but  it  is  difficult  to  update.  Therefore,  single 
packaging  is  suitable  for  games  or  unilateral  information  delivery  services.  The  second 
type  of  content  development,  browser  type,  is  a  commonly  used  method  of  Web-based 
content  development  suited  for  portal,  news,  and  advertisement  services.  This  type  is 
compatible  with  multi  platforms,  but  response  speed  is  slow.  The  last  type  of  content 
development, content plus viewer type, is used to implement content by embedding it in a 
player or viewer dedicated to content. This development method is suitable for providing 
service such as film or music and content service such as e-Books.

Figure 6. Types of Contents Development 

As  Digital  Textbooks  feature  easy  development  of  content  in  the  unified  format  and 
easy  application  of  paper  and  multimedia  materials,  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently 
developed using the content plus viewer type development. This type can be proposed as 
the most suitable method of content development in the future cloud environment as well.  

 

3.2. Ways of Service Provision 

The  methods  of  providing  Digital  Textbook  service  can  be  classified  by  four  ways: 
native,  mobile,  Web, and hybrid  applications  such as  Figure  7.  In  the  native  application 
setting,  students  can  immediately  use  the  Digital  Textbook  embedded  in  the  application 
regardless of network access. Also, as this model has a high usage of device function, it is 
possible to implement the Digital Textbook which enables learning offline based on easy 
application  of  various  types  of  content,  fast  speed  and  high  performance.  However,  as 
native  application  depends  heavily  on  devices,  it  has  weaknesses  of  additional 
development for each OS and high development cost. Mobile Web is a method of storing 
all data and applications in the Internet server and transmitting in HTML when users get 
access to the server through the browser. Despite its slow speed, this type can be used in 
all  devices  with  one  single  application.  Web  application  is  a  method  of  providing  Web 
services  through  App  calls  embedded  in  the  server.  It  is  easy  to  develop  and  has  a  low

Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
dependency  on  devices,  network  access  is  indispensable  and  push  service  is  impossible 
with this type. Hybrid application is a combined development method which implements 
UI  in  the  native  application  type  and  key  services  in  the  web  application  type  of  the 
strengths of this type include fast operation speed and reduction in OS development costs, 
but its service speed is relatively slow[10]. 
 

(a)  Native (b) Mobile (c) Web 

Figure 7. Ways of Service Provision 

 

Considering  the  property  of  Digital  Textbook  content  which  includes  various 
multimedia  educational  materials  and additional  learning  materials  at the  network  speed 
of  current  schools  and  educational  field,  hybrid  application  is  the  most  appropriate 
proposal.  However,  in  a  long-term  cloud  environment,  cloud  streaming  type  will  be  the 
best choice, as all applications are executed on the Internet server. In the cloud streaming 
service,  devices  play  the  role  of  simply  displaying  the  screen  created  on  the  server  and 
application itself is run on the server. Therefore the service is fast and Digital Textbooks 
can be used immediately without complicated procedures such as installation. As various 
types of OS can be installed in the server, cloud streaming type is not restricted by OS and 
it  is  very  easy  for  developers  to  advance  or  update.  Because  the  quality  of  network  is 
directly related to the quality of Digital Textbook service, it is recommended to introduce 
this type when the fourth generation LTE network environment becomes universal.  
 
3.3. Methods for Content Distribution  

The  methods  for  distributing  Digital  Textbook  content  are  one  of  the  most  important 
factors for determining the types of teachers and students use of Digital Textbooks. They 
have to be certified by school code to download Digital Textbooks from the server such as 
Figure  8.  Content  distribution  can  be  understood  in  three  ways:  full  download,  partial 
download,  and  Web  access.  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently  distributed  through  the  full 
download service method through Web.

Abstract 

We  live  in  a  knowledge-based  information  society  where  a  new  technology  emerges 
overnight and new information is produced every day. Our current shift towards a more 
digital  world  has  led  to  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  use  of  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  in  education.  With  the  development  of  innovative 
technology,  educational  content,  methods  of  teaching  and  learning,  educational 
environments,  and  the  roles  of  teachers  and  schools  can  be  changed.  However,  despite 
numerous efforts to improve educational standards, school systems around the world are 
struggling  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  21st  century  learners  and  employers.  Climate 
change has also affected education. Therefore, the need for learning – and the way people 
learn – is changing faster than before. The paradigm shift to a world of the 21st century 
learning  is  rooted  in  a  set  of  goals  for  all  learners.  SMART  education  is  a  creativity-
focused,  customized  system  for  developing  new  ways  to  learn  by  using  up-to-date 
technology  like  cloud  computing,  and  enables  students    to  study  with  various  materials 
based on their aptitudes and intellectual levels using mobile Digital Textbook at anytime, 
anywhere and on any devices. This paper examines various ways of content development 
for  digital  textbook,  service  provision,  and  service  delivery,  and  suggests  the  most 
suitable model in a cloud computing environment in order to  propose a suitable service 
model for Digital Textbook in the cloud computing environment.

1. Introduction  

The emergence of Digital Natives has led to changes in communication methods, forms 
of  knowledge,  and  the  ways  in  which  collective  intelligence  is  cultivated  for  social 
productivity.  These  radical  changes  in  the  environment  are  demanding  reform  in 
education. Similar to the way in which modern schooling systems had replaced agrarian 
education,  to  meet  societal  demands  for  a  skilled  labor  force,  our  knowledge-based 
society  also  calls  for  changes  in  the  education  system.  In  short,  there  is  a  need  for  a 
radical  paradigm  shift  from  the  present  industrial  approach  to  education  to  one  that 
supports the rising knowledge-based information society [1].  

With  the  growing  demands  of  society  and  the  increasing  uses  of  technology  in  our 
daily  lives,  new  generations  of  the  21st  century  will  require  an  education  system  that 
attends  to  both  needs.  One  strategy,  that  can  lead  this  reform  is  SMART  education. 
SMART education can be defined as an educational system that allows students to learn 
by  using  up-to-date  technology  and  it  enables  students  to  study  with  various  materials 
based  on  their  aptitudes  and  intellectual  levels.  The  difference  between  the  current 
education system and SMART education is similar to the difference between regular cell 
phones and smart phones; while regular phones have programs and systems supplied by 
manufacturers,  smart  phones  can  be  customized  to  meet  the  users’  needs.  Current

is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th

As  for  the  document  format,  Digital  Textbooks  manage  PDF  image  files  based  on 
XML and apply the SCORM standard to the object of content. The platforms of Digital 
Textbooks  are  developed  to  support  various  operating  system  such  as  Windows,  open 
software  Linux  for  PC,  and  iOS,  open  software  Android  for  smart  device[4].  Digital 
Textbooks consist of 10 detailed functions, such as, viewing, assistive tools, multimedia, 
search, etc (Table 1).

2.3. Cloud Computing  

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

Figure 4. Cloud Computing Layers 

 

Cloud computing providers offer their services based on three fundamental models:[8, 
9]  Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),  platform  as  a  service  (PaaS),  and  software  as  a 
service(SaaS) IaaS is the most basic and each higher model abstracts from the details of 
the lower models (Figure 4).  

First, in the Iaas model, cloud providers offer computers, as physical or more often as 
virtual machines, and other resources. Second, in the PaaS model, cloud providers deliver 
a  computing  platform  typically  including  operating  system,  programming  language 
execution  environment,  database,  and  web  server.  Finally,  in  the  SasS  model,  cloud 
providers  install  and  operate  application  software  in  the  cloud,  while  cloud  users  get 
access  to  the  software  from  cloud  clients.  The  cloud  users  do  not  manage  the  cloud 
infrastructure and platform on which the application is running. This eliminates the need 
to  install  and  run  the  application  on  the  cloud  user's  own  computers  simplifying 
maintenance  and  support.  Cloud  computing  can  give  us  benefits  to  reduce  the  cost  of 
replacing  hardware  that  has  long  been  viewed  as  flawed,  concentrate  on  managing 
licenses, make it easier to provide software(Figure 5), and expect to have superior security.

3. Service Model of Digital Textbook in Cloud Computing Environment 
 
3.1. Types of Content Development  

There  are  three  general  types  of  content  development  for  Digital  Textbooks: 
single packaging type, HTML and CSS-based browser type, and content plus viewer type, 
which  embeds  exclusive  player  or  viewer  in  the  application  itself  such  as  Figure  6[10]. 
The first type of content development, single packaging, is the most general development 
method  in  which  the  application  itself  becomes  the  content  by  including  metadata  of 
content in the application. As data are processed inside the application, this type is fast in 
response  speed  and  easy  to  develop,  but  it  is  difficult  to  update.  Therefore,  single 
packaging  is  suitable  for  games  or  unilateral  information  delivery  services.  The  second 
type  of  content  development,  browser  type,  is  a  commonly  used  method  of  Web-based 
content  development  suited  for  portal,  news,  and  advertisement  services.  This  type  is 
compatible  with  multi  platforms,  but  response  speed  is  slow.  The  last  type  of  content 
development, content plus viewer type, is used to implement content by embedding it in a 
player or viewer dedicated to content. This development method is suitable for providing 
service such as film or music and content service such as e-Books.

Figure 6. Types of Contents Development 

As  Digital  Textbooks  feature  easy  development  of  content  in  the  unified  format  and 
easy  application  of  paper  and  multimedia  materials,  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently 
developed using the content plus viewer type development. This type can be proposed as 
the most suitable method of content development in the future cloud environment as well.  

 

3.2. Ways of Service Provision 

The  methods  of  providing  Digital  Textbook  service  can  be  classified  by  four  ways: 
native,  mobile,  Web, and hybrid  applications  such as  Figure  7.  In  the  native  application 
setting,  students  can  immediately  use  the  Digital  Textbook  embedded  in  the  application 
regardless of network access. Also, as this model has a high usage of device function, it is 
possible to implement the Digital Textbook which enables learning offline based on easy 
application  of  various  types  of  content,  fast  speed  and  high  performance.  However,  as 
native  application  depends  heavily  on  devices,  it  has  weaknesses  of  additional 
development for each OS and high development cost. Mobile Web is a method of storing 
all data and applications in the Internet server and transmitting in HTML when users get 
access to the server through the browser. Despite its slow speed, this type can be used in 
all  devices  with  one  single  application.  Web  application  is  a  method  of  providing  Web 
services  through  App  calls  embedded  in  the  server.  It  is  easy  to  develop  and  has  a  low

79 

International Journal of u- and e- Service, Science and Technology 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
dependency  on  devices,  network  access  is  indispensable  and  push  service  is  impossible 
with this type. Hybrid application is a combined development method which implements 
UI  in  the  native  application  type  and  key  services  in  the  web  application  type  of  the 
strengths of this type include fast operation speed and reduction in OS development costs, 
but its service speed is relatively slow[10].

Figure 7. Ways of Service Provision 

 

Considering  the  property  of  Digital  Textbook  content  which  includes  various 
multimedia  educational  materials  and additional  learning  materials  at the  network  speed 
of  current  schools  and  educational  field,  hybrid  application  is  the  most  appropriate 
proposal.  However,  in  a  long-term  cloud  environment,  cloud  streaming  type  will  be  the 
best choice, as all applications are executed on the Internet server. In the cloud streaming 
service,  devices  play  the  role  of  simply  displaying  the  screen  created  on  the  server  and 
application itself is run on the server. Therefore the service is fast and Digital Textbooks 
can be used immediately without complicated procedures such as installation. As various 
types of OS can be installed in the server, cloud streaming type is not restricted by OS and 
it  is  very  easy  for  developers  to  advance  or  update.  Because  the  quality  of  network  is 
directly related to the quality of Digital Textbook service, it is recommended to introduce 
this type when the fourth generation LTE network environment becomes universal.  
 
3.3. Methods for Content Distribution  

The  methods  for  distributing  Digital  Textbook  content  are  one  of  the  most  important 
factors for determining the types of teachers and students use of Digital Textbooks. They 
have to be certified by school code to download Digital Textbooks from the server such as 
Figure  8.  Content  distribution  can  be  understood  in  three  ways:  full  download,  partial 
download,  and  Web  access.  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently  distributed  through  the  full 
download service method through Web.

Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 

Figure 8. Method of Contents Distribution 

 

However,  as  one  of  the  primary  reasons  for  introducing  Digital  Textbooks  is  to 
establish  a  fast  system  that  keeps  up  to  date  with  our  changing  knowledge,  the  content 
distribution  method  should  be  carried  out  according  to  these  needs.  Therefore,  content 
distribution  methods  should  shift  from  simply  using  cloud-based  storage  to  a  partial 
download method, which is easier for periodic data updates and ultimately leads to access 
through online streaming.  
 
4. Conclusion 

SMART-Education  marks  the  beginning  of  a  new  digital  era  for  our  society. 
Communication has expanded beyond the traditional forms of writing letters to the usage 
of  digital  devices,  iTunes,  and  YouTube.  Not  only  the  3R’s  (Read,  wRite,  aRithmetic), 
which has been regarded as the basic capabilities of humans necessary for success in the 
current  century,  but  7C’s  (Critical  thinking  and  problem  solving,  Creativity  and 
innovation, Collaboration and leadership, Cross-cultural understanding, Communication, 
ICT literacy, Career and life skills) and digital literacy have also become a standard in the 
21st century [11]. 

The  application  of  ICT  to  education  has  improved  teaching  and  learning  methods 
through  various  functions  that  are  not  available  in  traditional  classrooms.  ICT  has 
demonstrated  that  it  allows  students  to  have  customized  learning  experience  tailored  to 
their interests and academic capacities. For Digital Textbook service in a cloud computing 
environment,  this  study  suggested  service  models  by  combining  the  ways  of  service 
development,  content  provision,  and  content  distribution.  When  implementing  these 
service models, it is important to not only consider the types of content and data, capacity, 
user’s behavior, device, and network  environment, but it is also important to view these 
criteria in light of the strengths and weaknesses of each service model. As countries and 
regions  across  the  world  have  different  policies  on  Digital  Textbooks,  setting  standards 
for  its  implementation  into  school  classrooms  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  Not 
only  will  Digital  Textbooks  differ  across  cultural  contexts,  but  the  impacts  it  has  on 
environmental surroundings will differ as well. Therefore, we should lay the foundations 
of the educational system through cooperation with various principal agents [12]. Digital 
Textbooks will not  only  provide digitized access  to  printed textbooks, but  it will 
also  supplement  existing  educational  content  with  additional  resources  and  tools 
for learning.

Abstract 

We  live  in  a  knowledge-based  information  society  where  a  new  technology  emerges 
overnight and new information is produced every day. Our current shift towards a more 
digital  world  has  led  to  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  use  of  Information  and 
Communication  Technology  (ICT)  in  education.  With  the  development  of  innovative 
technology,  educational  content,  methods  of  teaching  and  learning,  educational 
environments,  and  the  roles  of  teachers  and  schools  can  be  changed.  However,  despite 
numerous efforts to improve educational standards, school systems around the world are 
struggling  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  21st  century  learners  and  employers.  Climate 
change has also affected education. Therefore, the need for learning – and the way people 
learn – is changing faster than before. The paradigm shift to a world of the 21st century 
learning  is  rooted  in  a  set  of  goals  for  all  learners.  SMART  education  is  a  creativity-
focused,  customized  system  for  developing  new  ways  to  learn  by  using  up-to-date 
technology  like  cloud  computing,  and  enables  students    to  study  with  various  materials 
based on their aptitudes and intellectual levels using mobile Digital Textbook at anytime, 
anywhere and on any devices. This paper examines various ways of content development 
for  digital  textbook,  service  provision,  and  service  delivery,  and  suggests  the  most 
suitable model in a cloud computing environment in order to  propose a suitable service 
model for Digital Textbook in the cloud computing environment.

1. Introduction  

The emergence of Digital Natives has led to changes in communication methods, forms 
of  knowledge,  and  the  ways  in  which  collective  intelligence  is  cultivated  for  social 
productivity.  These  radical  changes  in  the  environment  are  demanding  reform  in 
education. Similar to the way in which modern schooling systems had replaced agrarian 
education,  to  meet  societal  demands  for  a  skilled  labor  force,  our  knowledge-based 
society  also  calls  for  changes  in  the  education  system.  In  short,  there  is  a  need  for  a 
radical  paradigm  shift  from  the  present  industrial  approach  to  education  to  one  that 
supports the rising knowledge-based information society [1].  

With  the  growing  demands  of  society  and  the  increasing  uses  of  technology  in  our 
daily  lives,  new  generations  of  the  21st  century  will  require  an  education  system  that 
attends  to  both  needs.  One  strategy,  that  can  lead  this  reform  is  SMART  education. 
SMART education can be defined as an educational system that allows students to learn 
by  using  up-to-date  technology  and  it  enables  students  to  study  with  various  materials 
based  on  their  aptitudes  and  intellectual  levels.  The  difference  between  the  current 
education system and SMART education is similar to the difference between regular cell 
phones and smart phones; while regular phones have programs and systems supplied by 
manufacturers,  smart  phones  can  be  customized  to  meet  the  users’  needs.  Current

educational  approaches  are  based  on  a  teacher-centered  model  where  information  and 
knowledge flow in one direction from teachers to students. This one direction approach 
is unsatisfactory to both students performing at the top and bottom of the class 

The problem emerged when it came to educational competency. Korea’s ranked 29th 
in  education  competitiveness  globally,  according  to  a  survey  facilitated  by  the 
International  Institute for Management Development (IMD). However, according 
to statistics by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Korean 
students  are  performing  at  the  highest  level  of  achievement.  As  an  alternative  to 
replace  the  current  educational  system  in  an  industrial  society,  proposing  SMART 
education  is  a  global  trend  and  policy.  In  Finland,  a  customized  education  system  has 
already been built and has provided students with an up-to-date educational environment 
using  ICT  in  education.  Recently,  South  Korea  ranked  first  among  19  countries  in  the 
2009  Digital  Reading  Assessment  for  students’  problem  solving  capacity  using  the 
Internet,  this  data  was  also  included  in  PISA.  It  was  an  outstanding  achievement 
considering  that  the  students  were  high-school  students  preoccupied  with  college 
preparation.  It  proved  that  advanced  ICT  development  in  Korea,  can  contribute  to 
reducing the information gap, rather than widening education inequality.  Therefore, it is 
the opportune time to shift toward Smart education in order to prepare for our children's 
future.  

To  attain  the  vision  of  SMART  education,  the  Korean  government  has  initiated  five 
flagship  projects.  These  five  projects  are  1)Digital  Textbook  development  and 
application;  2)  promoting  online  classes  and  assessments;  3)creating  an  environment  to 
use  educational  content  safely;  4)building  teacher’s  competency;  and  5)establishing  a 
cloud-based  education  system.  Through  the  implementation  of  these  five  main  projects, 
diverse types of educational content will allow students to learn whenever and wherever 
they please.  As students will have access to these resources through all smart devices—
PCs,  laptops,  smart  tabs,  tablet  PCs,  and  smart  TVs,  they  can  learn  at  their  own 
convenience.  
 
2. Backgrounds 
 
2.1. The Definition of SMART Education 

SMART Education stands for “Self-directed, Motivated, Adapted,  Resource enriched, 
Technology-embedded”.  First,  “Self-directed”  characterizes  the  change  in  students  roles 
as  recipients  to  producers  of  knowledge  and  the  shift  of  teachers  from  deliverers  of 
knowledge to learning assistants(mentors). To achieve this, online assessments, academic 
performance  evaluations,  and  a  self-directed  learning  system  will  also  be  implemented. 
Second,  “Motivated”  highlights  the  way  in  which  SMART  education  will  encourage 
students to take interest in learning. SMART Education emphasizes teaching and learning 
methods  that  promotes  creative  problem-solving  and  process  -centered  individualized 
assessment. Students' learning experiences will be transformed from the typical textbook-
based to experience-based. Third, “Adapted” stands for the pursing of education through a 
customized educational system and a customized teaching and learning system. SMART 
Education strengthens the flexibility of the educational system and facilitates customized 
learning in connection with personal interests and future career aspirations. It also helps 
schools evolve from a place of delivering knowledge to a place that supports personalized 
learning  according  to  students’  levels  and  aptitudes.  Fourth,  “Resource  enriched” 
describes the support for rich teaching-learning materials. From a cloud learning service, 
SMART Education provides free access to  rich contents developed by public and private 
institutions and individuals in education, expands the joint use of domestic and overseas 
learning  resources,  and  promotes  collaborative  learning  through  the  contents  delivery

platforms. Fifth, “Technology-embedded” illustrates the use of the latest information and 
communications technology. SMART Education enables students to learn at anytime and 
anywhere  through  information  technology.  By  building  an  educational  environment  that 
encourages  student-centered  learning,  students  are  provided  with  diverse  methods  of 
learning tailored to self-selected areas of interest [2]. 

Figure 1. Steps of SMART Education 

 

SMART  Education  is  an  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  education.  Starting  in  the 
1990’s  implemented  since  in  the  early  1990s,  e-Learning  expanded  through  the 
introduction of LMS, and u-learning implemented through the introduction of ubiquitous 
technologies.  It  is  also  institutionalized  application  of  ICT  to  education  as  an  essential 
means of a future educational paradigm for the 21st century. 
 
2.2. Digital Textbook 

The  enormous  amounts  of  digital  information  that  we  produce  equates  to  1.8  zetta-
bytes  (180  trillion  gigabytes),  which  means  that  one  person  can  watch  a  two-hour  HD 
movie  for  47  million  years.  This  amount  of  information  consistently  increases  by  more 
than  double  every  two  years  while  a  cycle  of  information  exchange  is  also  shortening. 
Furthermore, traditional paper-based textbooks are quickly becoming outdated soon after 
they are published. 

The  Digital  Textbook  is  a  future-oriented  textbook  that  can  help  students  learn  in  a 
self-directed  manner  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  includes  learning  aids,  workbooks,  a 
dictionary, and notebook functions for self-directed studying, in addition to the content of 
traditional  textbooks[3].  As  it  incorporates  and  provides  advanced  multimedia  functions 
including  videos,  animations,  virtual  reality,  and  hyperlinks,  the  Digital  Textbook  is 
suitable for digital natives who are accustomed to the digital environment from childhood. 
Digital Textbooks allow students to have not only the content from general textbooks but 
also various customized learning materials  such as Figure 2.

Figure 2. Concept of Digital Textbook 

 

Digital  textbooks  provide  educational  content  through  multimedia  such  as  videos, 
animations, and virtual reality.  They also have interactive functions  that implemented to 
enable learners to learn according to their aptitudes, abilities, and levels. As illustrated in 
Figure 3, in order to assist with the use of digital textbooks, current digital textbooks have 
been designed to mirror the format of paper textbooks.  

Figure 3. User Interface of Digital Textbook(Mathematics, Elementary 

School, 2nd Grade) 

 

As  for  the  document  format,  Digital  Textbooks  manage  PDF  image  files  based  on 
XML and apply the SCORM standard to the object of content. The platforms of Digital 
Textbooks  are  developed  to  support  various  operating  system  such  as  Windows,  open 
software  Linux  for  PC,  and  iOS,  open  software  Android  for  smart  device[4].  Digital 
Textbooks consist of 10 detailed functions, such as, viewing, assistive tools, multimedia, 
search, etc (Table 1).

2.3. Cloud Computing  

Cloud  computing  is  the  use  of  computing  resources  (hardware  and  software)  that  are 
delivered as a service on a network [5]. End users gain access to cloud-based applications 
through  a  web  browser  or  a  light-weight  desktop  or  mobile  app  while  the  business 
software  and  user's  data  are  stored  on  the  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Users  claim  that 
cloud computing allows enterprises to update and manage their applications at a faster and 
more  convenient  pace.  Furthermore,  it  allows  IT  to  adjust  to  resources  more  rapidly  to 
meet changing and unpredictable business demands [6, 7].

replacing  hardware  that  has  long  been  viewed  as  flawed,  concentrate  on  managing 
licenses, make it easier to provide software(Figure 5), and expect to have superior security.

3. Service Model of Digital Textbook in Cloud Computing Environment 
 
3.1. Types of Content Development  

There  are  three  general  types  of  content  development  for  Digital  Textbooks: 
single packaging type, HTML and CSS-based browser type, and content plus viewer type, 
which  embeds  exclusive  player  or  viewer  in  the  application  itself  such  as  Figure  6[10]. 
The first type of content development, single packaging, is the most general development 
method  in  which  the  application  itself  becomes  the  content  by  including  metadata  of 
content in the application. As data are processed inside the application, this type is fast in 
response  speed  and  easy  to  develop,  but  it  is  difficult  to  update.  Therefore,  single 
packaging  is  suitable  for  games  or  unilateral  information  delivery  services.  The  second 
type  of  content  development,  browser  type,  is  a  commonly  used  method  of  Web-based 
content  development  suited  for  portal,  news,  and  advertisement  services.  This  type  is 
compatible  with  multi  platforms,  but  response  speed  is  slow.  The  last  type  of  content 
development, content plus viewer type, is used to implement content by embedding it in a 
player or viewer dedicated to content. This development method is suitable for providing 
service such as film or music and content service such as e-Books.

Figure 6. Types of Contents Development 

As  Digital  Textbooks  feature  easy  development  of  content  in  the  unified  format  and 
easy  application  of  paper  and  multimedia  materials,  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently 
developed using the content plus viewer type development. This type can be proposed as 
the most suitable method of content development in the future cloud environment as well.  

 

3.2. Ways of Service Provision 

The  methods  of  providing  Digital  Textbook  service  can  be  classified  by  four  ways: 
native,  mobile,  Web, and hybrid  applications  such as  Figure  7.  In  the  native  application 
setting,  students  can  immediately  use  the  Digital  Textbook  embedded  in  the  application 
regardless of network access. Also, as this model has a high usage of device function, it is 
possible to implement the Digital Textbook which enables learning offline based on easy 
application  of  various  types  of  content,  fast  speed  and  high  performance.  However,  as 
native  application  depends  heavily  on  devices,  it  has  weaknesses  of  additional 
development for each OS and high development cost. Mobile Web is a method of storing 
all data and applications in the Internet server and transmitting in HTML when users get 
access to the server through the browser. Despite its slow speed, this type can be used in 
all  devices  with  one  single  application.  Web  application  is  a  method  of  providing  Web 
services  through  App  calls  embedded  in  the  server.  It  is  easy  to  develop  and  has  a  low

dependency  on  devices,  network  access  is  indispensable  and  push  service  is  impossible 
with this type. Hybrid application is a combined development method which implements 
UI  in  the  native  application  type  and  key  services  in  the  web  application  type  of  the 
strengths of this type include fast operation speed and reduction in OS development costs, 
but its service speed is relatively slow[10].

Considering  the  property  of  Digital  Textbook  content  which  includes  various 
multimedia  educational  materials  and additional  learning  materials  at the  network  speed 
of  current  schools  and  educational  field,  hybrid  application  is  the  most  appropriate 
proposal.  However,  in  a  long-term  cloud  environment,  cloud  streaming  type  will  be  the 
best choice, as all applications are executed on the Internet server. In the cloud streaming 
service,  devices  play  the  role  of  simply  displaying  the  screen  created  on  the  server  and 
application itself is run on the server. Therefore the service is fast and Digital Textbooks 
can be used immediately without complicated procedures such as installation. As various 
types of OS can be installed in the server, cloud streaming type is not restricted by OS and 
it  is  very  easy  for  developers  to  advance  or  update.  Because  the  quality  of  network  is 
directly related to the quality of Digital Textbook service, it is recommended to introduce 
this type when the fourth generation LTE network environment becomes universal.  
 
3.3. Methods for Content Distribution  

The  methods  for  distributing  Digital  Textbook  content  are  one  of  the  most  important 
factors for determining the types of teachers and students use of Digital Textbooks. They 
have to be certified by school code to download Digital Textbooks from the server such as 
Figure  8.  Content  distribution  can  be  understood  in  three  ways:  full  download,  partial 
download,  and  Web  access.  Digital  Textbooks  are  currently  distributed  through  the  full 
download service method through Web.

Figure 8. Method of Contents Distribution 

 

However,  as  one  of  the  primary  reasons  for  introducing  Digital  Textbooks  is  to 
establish  a  fast  system  that  keeps  up  to  date  with  our  changing  knowledge,  the  content 
distribution  method  should  be  carried  out  according  to  these  needs.  Therefore,  content 
distribution  methods  should  shift  from  simply  using  cloud-based  storage  to  a  partial 
download method, which is easier for periodic data updates and ultimately leads to access 
through online streaming.  
 
4. Conclusion 

SMART-Education  marks  the  beginning  of  a  new  digital  era  for  our  society. 
Communication has expanded beyond the traditional forms of writing letters to the usage 
of  digital  devices,  iTunes,  and  YouTube.  Not  only  the  3R’s  (Read,  wRite,  aRithmetic), 
which has been regarded as the basic capabilities of humans necessary for success in the 
current  century,  but  7C’s  (Critical  thinking  and  problem  solving,  Creativity  and 
innovation, Collaboration and leadership, Cross-cultural understanding, Communication, 
ICT literacy, Career and life skills) and digital literacy have also become a standard in the 
21st century [11]. 

The  application  of  ICT  to  education  has  improved  teaching  and  learning  methods 
through  various  functions  that  are  not  available  in  traditional  classrooms.  ICT  has 
demonstrated  that  it  allows  students  to  have  customized  learning  experience  tailored  to 
their interests and academic capacities. For Digital Textbook service in a cloud computing 
environment,  this  study  suggested  service  models  by  combining  the  ways  of  service 
development,  content  provision,  and  content  distribution.  When  implementing  these 
service models, it is important to not only consider the types of content and data, capacity, 
user’s behavior, device, and network  environment, but it is also important to view these 
criteria in light of the strengths and weaknesses of each service model. As countries and 
regions  across  the  world  have  different  policies  on  Digital  Textbooks,  setting  standards 
for  its  implementation  into  school  classrooms  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  Not 
only  will  Digital  Textbooks  differ  across  cultural  contexts,  but  the  impacts  it  has  on 
environmental surroundings will differ as well. Therefore, we should lay the foundations 
of the educational system through cooperation with various principal agents [12]. Digital 
Textbooks will not  only  provide digitized access  to  printed textbooks, but  it will 
also  supplement  existing  educational  content  with  additional  resources  and  tools 
for learning.
