1. Introduction 

Recently  there  has  been  increasing  researches  on  computing  environment  caused  by 
changes in computing paradigm of security aspects in relation to cloud computing. Big data 
issues  and  eco-system  of  cloud  computing  are  operated  on  a  variety  of  devices  which  are 
required for the security aspects corresponding to various cloud computing devices. However, 
there  are  multiple  difficulties  in  establishing  the  actual  computing  environment  for  security 
verification  and  performing  a  security  test  based  on  the  clouds  computing  environment  in 
terms of time and cost. In  order to resolve these problems,  we propose the pilot research in 
association  with  a  testbed  for  cloud  computing-based  security  research  using  virtualization 
and  multi-tenancy.  In  addition,  we  describe  2  case  study  scenarios  of  cyber-quarantine  and 
cyber-criminal  investigation  for  Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing 
(SRTB) for various computing application. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we  described  the  related  work  for  testbed  research  and  project  in  domestic  and  aboard.  In 
Section 3, the SRTB is defined. In section 4, explanation on the functions and experiment life 
cycle  of  SRTB  is  presented.  Section  5  describes  2  case  study  scenarios  of  SRTB  for 
application. Finally, the conclusion and future work is presented in Section 6.

3. Definition of SRTB 

SRTB  (Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing)  refers  to  a  test-bed  for 
cloud-based  security  research.  It  can  give  an  actual  security  test  by  building  up  an  actual 
network using network simulation of NS (Network Simulator) [8]. SRTB consists of resource 
management,  virtualization,  multi-tenancy,  template  tools,  and  monitoring  tools.  Cloud 
resources are controlled by the resource management. The cloud resources are also virtualized 
by  the  virtualization.  Multiple  security  researches  are  simultaneously  supported  by  multi-
tenancy.  The  template  tools  provide  a  variety  of  template  functions  with  relation  to  VM, 
computing,  and  networking.  The  monitoring  tools  are  monitoring  the  relative  target  to 
connection with the template tools.  
 

Figure 3. Multi-tenancy Function of SRTB 

 

In the aspects of resource management of SRTB, the cloud resources can be divided into 
physical, logical, and composite resources. In the accessing resources for security researchers, 
their  authentication  procedure  and  an  access  control  policy  for  the  assigned  resources  are 
given.  The  virtualization  of  SRTB  greatly  supports  computing,  storage,  and  network 
virtualization. Multi-tenancy of SRTB means the use of one S/W by several users. SRTB in 
multi-tenancy environment  makes a resource pool and provides one service based on it. All 
security researchers share this service as shown in Figure 3. 

The greatest advantage of multi-tenancy is economy of scale. If SRTB is used, researchers 
do  not  need  to  make  new  individual  system  for  security  research  and  can  minimize  IT 
investment. Also, as only one system is managed, the management cost can be reduced. When 
errors  are  found,  all  researchers  can  have  the  same  benefits  by  one  correction  and  use 
simultaneously  by  one  upgrade.  The  template  tools  of  SRTB  provide  a  template  for  the 
system  constructed  for  assigned  resources  (i.e.,  computing,  storage,  and  networking).  The 
monitoring  tools  of  SRTB provide  a  variety  of  tools  to  monitor  the  system  produced  in the 
template tools as shown in Figure 4.

4. Functions & Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 
 
4.1. Functions of SRTB 

The  functions  of  SRTB  include  resource  management,  VM  preliminary  and  tolerance, 
script,  emulator,  template,  deployment,  and  monitoring  functions.  Resource  management 
functions  of  SRTB  include  management  of  physical,  logical,  and  synthetic  resources  which 
are  assigned  to  a  researcher  and  a  SRTB  administrator.  Function  of  a  VM  preliminary  and 
tolerance  provides  additional  resources  to  the  assigned  resources  for  flexibility.  In  order  to 
solve the system operation problems, a tolerance function are offered with respect  to giving 
emergency  state  to  VM  operation.  Functions  of  script  and  emulator  provide  the  emulator 
function of NS and help researchers describe a scenario using a NS script. It sets a network by 
analyzing  a  NS  script  code  and  fitting  script  code  objects  to  the  NS  script  driven  and 
described in VM. The templates and deployments support the convenient operation and fasten 
deployment of testbed environment construction as shown in Figure 4. And monitoring tools 
offer monitoring, logging, auditing, analysis, and visualization functions. 
 
4.2. Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 

Figure 5 presents the research experiment life cycle of SRTB using various components as 
shown  in  Figure  4.  The  experiment  life  cycle  of  SRTB  is  composed  by  4  steps.  Firstly,  to 
conduct security research and test in SRTB, the utilization of resources should be assigned by 
the  SRTB  administrator.  Secondly,  the  assigned  resources  are  designed,  deployed  and 
composited by researcher or pre-descripted templates. Researcher constructs VM, OS, storage, 
and  network  using  the  provided  template  and  the  composed  templates.  It  also  constructs  a 
virtual  network  using  the  constructed  system.  In  addition,  researcher  constructs a  variety  of 
monitoring  tools  based  on  the  constructed  system  and  networking  for  monitoring  and 
inspection  of  the  assigned  resources.  The  security  researchers  make  a  security  research 
scenario by the NS or shell script using the constructed system, networking, and monitoring 
tools on SRTB. Thirdly, the experiment scenarios are operated, monitored, and analyzed. The 
security researchers operate the security research scenarios using the NS or shell script. When 
the  security  research  scenario  is  operated,  the  results  of  monitoring  and  inspection  by 
monitoring  tools  are  produced  in  many  different  forms.  The  results  are  analyzed  by  the 
statistical techniques and data mining methods. The visualization of results is also reported in 
GUI environment. Lastly, when the security research scenario and analysis are completed, the 
assigned resources are withdrawn to the SRTB administrator. And the produced results by the

1. Introduction 

Recently  there  has  been  increasing  researches  on  computing  environment  caused  by 
changes in computing paradigm of security aspects in relation to cloud computing. Big data 
issues  and  eco-system  of  cloud  computing  are  operated  on  a  variety  of  devices  which  are 
required for the security aspects corresponding to various cloud computing devices. However, 
there  are  multiple  difficulties  in  establishing  the  actual  computing  environment  for  security 
verification  and  performing  a  security  test  based  on  the  clouds  computing  environment  in 
terms of time and cost. In  order to resolve these problems,  we propose the pilot research in 
association  with  a  testbed  for  cloud  computing-based  security  research  using  virtualization 
and  multi-tenancy.  In  addition,  we  describe  2  case  study  scenarios  of  cyber-quarantine  and 
cyber-criminal  investigation  for  Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing 
(SRTB) for various computing application. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we  described  the  related  work  for  testbed  research  and  project  in  domestic  and  aboard.  In 
Section 3, the SRTB is defined. In section 4, explanation on the functions and experiment life 
cycle  of  SRTB  is  presented.  Section  5  describes  2  case  study  scenarios  of  SRTB  for 
application. Finally, the conclusion and future work is presented in Section 6.

Within  FP7,  the  European  Commission  has  facilitated  the  creation  of  European  expert 
groups  around the  theme  FIRE  (Future  Internet  Research  and  Experimentation)  [2-4].  FIRE 
has  two  related  dimensions:  on  one  hand,  promoting  experimentally-driven  long-term, 
visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future 
Internet;  on  the  other  hand,  building  a  large-scale  experimentation  facility  supporting  both 
medium-  and  long-term  research  on  networks  and  services  by  gradually  federating  existing 
and  new  testbeds  for  emerging  or  future  Internet  technologies.  By  addressing  future 
challenges  for  the  Internet  such  as  mobility,  scalability,  security  and  privacy,  this  new 
experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet 
development. 

The  NWGN  (NeW-Generation  Network)  [5,  6]  is  based  on  new  design  concepts  looking 
further  beyond  the  next-generation  network  (NGN)  and  the  Internet.  In  short,  it  aims  to 
fundamentally  solve  difficult  issues  and  limits  in  an  improved  and  extended  Internet,  by  a 
clean slate approach designing unconstrained by existing technologies as shown in Figure 2.

The  FIF  (Future  Internet  Forum)  Testbed  Working  Group  [7]  in  Korea  pursues  open 
discussion and practical exploration on construction, operation, and experimentation of Future 
Internet testbeds with industry, university, and research laboratory partners. The activities of 
the  FIF  Testbed  Working  Group  focus  on  envisioning  Future  Internet  testbeds,  practical 
construction,  operation,  and  experimentation  of  testbeds,  and  sharing  state-of-the-art 
technologies on Future Internet testbeds. 
 
3. Definition of SRTB 

SRTB  (Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing)  refers  to  a  test-bed  for 
cloud-based  security  research.  It  can  give  an  actual  security  test  by  building  up  an  actual 
network using network simulation of NS (Network Simulator) [8]. SRTB consists of resource 
management,  virtualization,  multi-tenancy,  template  tools,  and  monitoring  tools.  Cloud 
resources are controlled by the resource management. The cloud resources are also virtualized 
by  the  virtualization.  Multiple  security  researches  are  simultaneously  supported  by  multi-
tenancy.  The  template  tools  provide  a  variety  of  template  functions  with  relation  to  VM, 
computing,  and  networking.  The  monitoring  tools  are  monitoring  the  relative  target  to 
connection with the template tools.  
 

Figure 3. Multi-tenancy Function of SRTB 

 

In the aspects of resource management of SRTB, the cloud resources can be divided into 
physical, logical, and composite resources. In the accessing resources for security researchers, 
their  authentication  procedure  and  an  access  control  policy  for  the  assigned  resources  are 
given.  The  virtualization  of  SRTB  greatly  supports  computing,  storage,  and  network 
virtualization. Multi-tenancy of SRTB means the use of one S/W by several users. SRTB in 
multi-tenancy environment  makes a resource pool and provides one service based on it. All 
security researchers share this service as shown in Figure 3. 

The greatest advantage of multi-tenancy is economy of scale. If SRTB is used, researchers 
do  not  need  to  make  new  individual  system  for  security  research  and  can  minimize  IT 
investment. Also, as only one system is managed, the management cost can be reduced. When 
errors  are  found,  all  researchers  can  have  the  same  benefits  by  one  correction  and  use 
simultaneously  by  one  upgrade.  The  template  tools  of  SRTB  provide  a  template  for  the 
system  constructed  for  assigned  resources  (i.e.,  computing,  storage,  and  networking).  The 
monitoring  tools  of  SRTB provide  a  variety  of  tools  to  monitor  the  system  produced  in the 
template tools as shown in Figure 4.

4. Functions & Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 
 
4.1. Functions of SRTB 

The  functions  of  SRTB  include  resource  management,  VM  preliminary  and  tolerance, 
script,  emulator,  template,  deployment,  and  monitoring  functions.  Resource  management 
functions  of  SRTB  include  management  of  physical,  logical,  and  synthetic  resources  which 
are  assigned  to  a  researcher  and  a  SRTB  administrator.  Function  of  a  VM  preliminary  and 
tolerance  provides  additional  resources  to  the  assigned  resources  for  flexibility.  In  order  to 
solve the system operation problems, a tolerance function are offered with respect  to giving 
emergency  state  to  VM  operation.  Functions  of  script  and  emulator  provide  the  emulator 
function of NS and help researchers describe a scenario using a NS script. It sets a network by 
analyzing  a  NS  script  code  and  fitting  script  code  objects  to  the  NS  script  driven  and 
described in VM. The templates and deployments support the convenient operation and fasten 
deployment of testbed environment construction as shown in Figure 4. And monitoring tools 
offer monitoring, logging, auditing, analysis, and visualization functions. 
 
4.2. Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 

Figure 5 presents the research experiment life cycle of SRTB using various components as 
shown  in  Figure  4.  The  experiment  life  cycle  of  SRTB  is  composed  by  4  steps.  Firstly,  to 
conduct security research and test in SRTB, the utilization of resources should be assigned by 
the  SRTB  administrator.  Secondly,  the  assigned  resources  are  designed,  deployed  and 
composited by researcher or pre-descripted templates. Researcher constructs VM, OS, storage, 
and  network  using  the  provided  template  and  the  composed  templates.  It  also  constructs  a 
virtual  network  using  the  constructed  system.  In  addition,  researcher  constructs a  variety  of 
monitoring  tools  based  on  the  constructed  system  and  networking  for  monitoring  and 
inspection  of  the  assigned  resources.  The  security  researchers  make  a  security  research 
scenario by the NS or shell script using the constructed system, networking, and monitoring 
tools on SRTB. Thirdly, the experiment scenarios are operated, monitored, and analyzed. The 
security researchers operate the security research scenarios using the NS or shell script. When 
the  security  research  scenario  is  operated,  the  results  of  monitoring  and  inspection  by 
monitoring  tools  are  produced  in  many  different  forms.  The  results  are  analyzed  by  the 
statistical techniques and data mining methods. The visualization of results is also reported in 
GUI environment. Lastly, when the security research scenario and analysis are completed, the 
assigned resources are withdrawn to the SRTB administrator. And the produced results by the

Within  FP7,  the  European  Commission  has  facilitated  the  creation  of  European  expert 
groups  around the  theme  FIRE  (Future  Internet  Research  and  Experimentation)  [2-4].  FIRE 
has  two  related  dimensions:  on  one  hand,  promoting  experimentally-driven  long-term, 
visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future 
Internet;  on  the  other  hand,  building  a  large-scale  experimentation  facility  supporting  both 
medium-  and  long-term  research  on  networks  and  services  by  gradually  federating  existing 
and  new  testbeds  for  emerging  or  future  Internet  technologies.  By  addressing  future 
challenges  for  the  Internet  such  as  mobility,  scalability,  security  and  privacy,  this  new 
experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet 
development. 

The  NWGN  (NeW-Generation  Network)  [5,  6]  is  based  on  new  design  concepts  looking 
further  beyond  the  next-generation  network  (NGN)  and  the  Internet.  In  short,  it  aims  to 
fundamentally  solve  difficult  issues  and  limits  in  an  improved  and  extended  Internet,  by  a 
clean slate approach designing unconstrained by existing technologies as shown in Figure 2.

The  FIF  (Future  Internet  Forum)  Testbed  Working  Group  [7]  in  Korea  pursues  open 
discussion and practical exploration on construction, operation, and experimentation of Future 
Internet testbeds with industry, university, and research laboratory partners. The activities of 
the  FIF  Testbed  Working  Group  focus  on  envisioning  Future  Internet  testbeds,  practical 
construction,  operation,  and  experimentation  of  testbeds,  and  sharing  state-of-the-art 
technologies on Future Internet testbeds. 
 
3. Definition of SRTB 

SRTB  (Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing)  refers  to  a  test-bed  for 
cloud-based  security  research.  It  can  give  an  actual  security  test  by  building  up  an  actual 
network using network simulation of NS (Network Simulator) [8]. SRTB consists of resource 
management,  virtualization,  multi-tenancy,  template  tools,  and  monitoring  tools.  Cloud 
resources are controlled by the resource management. The cloud resources are also virtualized 
by  the  virtualization.  Multiple  security  researches  are  simultaneously  supported  by  multi-
tenancy.  The  template  tools  provide  a  variety  of  template  functions  with  relation  to  VM, 
computing,  and  networking.  The  monitoring  tools  are  monitoring  the  relative  target  to 
connection with the template tools.  
 

Figure 3. Multi-tenancy Function of SRTB 

 

In the aspects of resource management of SRTB, the cloud resources can be divided into 
physical, logical, and composite resources. In the accessing resources for security researchers, 
their  authentication  procedure  and  an  access  control  policy  for  the  assigned  resources  are 
given.  The  virtualization  of  SRTB  greatly  supports  computing,  storage,  and  network 
virtualization. Multi-tenancy of SRTB means the use of one S/W by several users. SRTB in 
multi-tenancy environment  makes a resource pool and provides one service based on it. All 
security researchers share this service as shown in Figure 3. 

The greatest advantage of multi-tenancy is economy of scale. If SRTB is used, researchers 
do  not  need  to  make  new  individual  system  for  security  research  and  can  minimize  IT 
investment. Also, as only one system is managed, the management cost can be reduced. When 
errors  are  found,  all  researchers  can  have  the  same  benefits  by  one  correction  and  use 
simultaneously  by  one  upgrade.  The  template  tools  of  SRTB  provide  a  template  for  the 
system  constructed  for  assigned  resources  (i.e.,  computing,  storage,  and  networking).  The 
monitoring  tools  of  SRTB provide  a  variety  of  tools  to  monitor  the  system  produced  in the 
template tools as shown in Figure 4.

4. Functions & Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 
 
4.1. Functions of SRTB 

The  functions  of  SRTB  include  resource  management,  VM  preliminary  and  tolerance, 
script,  emulator,  template,  deployment,  and  monitoring  functions.  Resource  management 
functions  of  SRTB  include  management  of  physical,  logical,  and  synthetic  resources  which 
are  assigned  to  a  researcher  and  a  SRTB  administrator.  Function  of  a  VM  preliminary  and 
tolerance  provides  additional  resources  to  the  assigned  resources  for  flexibility.  In  order  to 
solve the system operation problems, a tolerance function are offered with respect  to giving 
emergency  state  to  VM  operation.  Functions  of  script  and  emulator  provide  the  emulator 
function of NS and help researchers describe a scenario using a NS script. It sets a network by 
analyzing  a  NS  script  code  and  fitting  script  code  objects  to  the  NS  script  driven  and 
described in VM. The templates and deployments support the convenient operation and fasten 
deployment of testbed environment construction as shown in Figure 4. And monitoring tools 
offer monitoring, logging, auditing, analysis, and visualization functions. 
 
4.2. Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 

Figure 5 presents the research experiment life cycle of SRTB using various components as 
shown  in  Figure  4.  The  experiment  life  cycle  of  SRTB  is  composed  by  4  steps.  Firstly,  to 
conduct security research and test in SRTB, the utilization of resources should be assigned by 
the  SRTB  administrator.  Secondly,  the  assigned  resources  are  designed,  deployed  and 
composited by researcher or pre-descripted templates. Researcher constructs VM, OS, storage, 
and  network  using  the  provided  template  and  the  composed  templates.  It  also  constructs  a 
virtual  network  using  the  constructed  system.  In  addition,  researcher  constructs a  variety  of 
monitoring  tools  based  on  the  constructed  system  and  networking  for  monitoring  and 
inspection  of  the  assigned  resources.  The  security  researchers  make  a  security  research 
scenario by the NS or shell script using the constructed system, networking, and monitoring 
tools on SRTB. Thirdly, the experiment scenarios are operated, monitored, and analyzed. The 
security researchers operate the security research scenarios using the NS or shell script. When 
the  security  research  scenario  is  operated,  the  results  of  monitoring  and  inspection  by 
monitoring  tools  are  produced  in  many  different  forms.  The  results  are  analyzed  by  the 
statistical techniques and data mining methods. The visualization of results is also reported in 
GUI environment. Lastly, when the security research scenario and analysis are completed, the 
assigned resources are withdrawn to the SRTB administrator. And the produced results by the

security  research  scenario  are  stored  in  researcher's  private  storage  or  shared  storage  by 
researcher groups.

computing  application  development  by  virtualization  and  multi-tenancy  functions  of  SRTB. 
Specially,  CI  (Continuous  Integration)  tools  managed  the  developed  source  code  and 
development environment parameters. And developed source codes are verified and tested by 
the security verification tools.

1. Introduction 

Recently  there  has  been  increasing  researches  on  computing  environment  caused  by 
changes in computing paradigm of security aspects in relation to cloud computing. Big data 
issues  and  eco-system  of  cloud  computing  are  operated  on  a  variety  of  devices  which  are 
required for the security aspects corresponding to various cloud computing devices. However, 
there  are  multiple  difficulties  in  establishing  the  actual  computing  environment  for  security 
verification  and  performing  a  security  test  based  on  the  clouds  computing  environment  in 
terms of time and cost. In  order to resolve these problems,  we propose the pilot research in 
association  with  a  testbed  for  cloud  computing-based  security  research  using  virtualization 
and  multi-tenancy.  In  addition,  we  describe  2  case  study  scenarios  of  cyber-quarantine  and 
cyber-criminal  investigation  for  Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing 
(SRTB) for various computing application. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we  described  the  related  work  for  testbed  research  and  project  in  domestic  and  aboard.  In 
Section 3, the SRTB is defined. In section 4, explanation on the functions and experiment life 
cycle  of  SRTB  is  presented.  Section  5  describes  2  case  study  scenarios  of  SRTB  for 
application. Finally, the conclusion and future work is presented in Section 6.

Within  FP7,  the  European  Commission  has  facilitated  the  creation  of  European  expert 
groups  around the  theme  FIRE  (Future  Internet  Research  and  Experimentation)  [2-4].  FIRE 
has  two  related  dimensions:  on  one  hand,  promoting  experimentally-driven  long-term, 
visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future 
Internet;  on  the  other  hand,  building  a  large-scale  experimentation  facility  supporting  both 
medium-  and  long-term  research  on  networks  and  services  by  gradually  federating  existing 
and  new  testbeds  for  emerging  or  future  Internet  technologies.  By  addressing  future 
challenges  for  the  Internet  such  as  mobility,  scalability,  security  and  privacy,  this  new 
experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet 
development. 

The  NWGN  (NeW-Generation  Network)  [5,  6]  is  based  on  new  design  concepts  looking

3. Definition of SRTB 

SRTB  (Security  Research  TestBed  based  on  cloud  computing)  refers  to  a  test-bed  for 
cloud-based  security  research.  It  can  give  an  actual  security  test  by  building  up  an  actual 
network using network simulation of NS (Network Simulator) [8]. SRTB consists of resource 
management,  virtualization,  multi-tenancy,  template  tools,  and  monitoring  tools.  Cloud 
resources are controlled by the resource management. The cloud resources are also virtualized 
by  the  virtualization.  Multiple  security  researches  are  simultaneously  supported  by  multi-
tenancy.  The  template  tools  provide  a  variety  of  template  functions  with  relation  to  VM, 
computing,  and  networking.  The  monitoring  tools  are  monitoring  the  relative  target  to 
connection with the template tools.  
 

Figure 3. Multi-tenancy Function of SRTB 

 

In the aspects of resource management of SRTB, the cloud resources can be divided into 
physical, logical, and composite resources. In the accessing resources for security researchers, 
their  authentication  procedure  and  an  access  control  policy  for  the  assigned  resources  are 
given.  The  virtualization  of  SRTB  greatly  supports  computing,  storage,  and  network 
virtualization. Multi-tenancy of SRTB means the use of one S/W by several users. SRTB in 
multi-tenancy environment  makes a resource pool and provides one service based on it. All 
security researchers share this service as shown in Figure 3. 

The greatest advantage of multi-tenancy is economy of scale. If SRTB is used, researchers 
do  not  need  to  make  new  individual  system  for  security  research  and  can  minimize  IT 
investment. Also, as only one system is managed, the management cost can be reduced. When 
errors  are  found,  all  researchers  can  have  the  same  benefits  by  one  correction  and  use 
simultaneously  by  one  upgrade.  The  template  tools  of  SRTB  provide  a  template  for  the 
system  constructed  for  assigned  resources  (i.e.,  computing,  storage,  and  networking).  The 
monitoring  tools  of  SRTB provide  a  variety  of  tools  to  monitor  the  system  produced  in the 
template tools as shown in Figure 4.

4. Functions & Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 
 
4.1. Functions of SRTB 

The  functions  of  SRTB  include  resource  management,  VM  preliminary  and  tolerance, 
script,  emulator,  template,  deployment,  and  monitoring  functions.  Resource  management 
functions  of  SRTB  include  management  of  physical,  logical,  and  synthetic  resources  which 
are  assigned  to  a  researcher  and  a  SRTB  administrator.  Function  of  a  VM  preliminary  and 
tolerance  provides  additional  resources  to  the  assigned  resources  for  flexibility.  In  order  to 
solve the system operation problems, a tolerance function are offered with respect  to giving 
emergency  state  to  VM  operation.  Functions  of  script  and  emulator  provide  the  emulator 
function of NS and help researchers describe a scenario using a NS script. It sets a network by 
analyzing  a  NS  script  code  and  fitting  script  code  objects  to  the  NS  script  driven  and 
described in VM. The templates and deployments support the convenient operation and fasten 
deployment of testbed environment construction as shown in Figure 4. And monitoring tools 
offer monitoring, logging, auditing, analysis, and visualization functions. 
 
4.2. Experiment Life Cycle of SRTB 

Figure 5 presents the research experiment life cycle of SRTB using various components as 
shown  in  Figure  4.  The  experiment  life  cycle  of  SRTB  is  composed  by  4  steps.  Firstly,  to 
conduct security research and test in SRTB, the utilization of resources should be assigned by 
the  SRTB  administrator.  Secondly,  the  assigned  resources  are  designed,  deployed  and 
composited by researcher or pre-descripted templates. Researcher constructs VM, OS, storage, 
and  network  using  the  provided  template  and  the  composed  templates.  It  also  constructs  a 
virtual  network  using  the  constructed  system.  In  addition,  researcher  constructs a  variety  of 
monitoring  tools  based  on  the  constructed  system  and  networking  for  monitoring  and 
inspection  of  the  assigned  resources.  The  security  researchers  make  a  security  research 
scenario by the NS or shell script using the constructed system, networking, and monitoring 
tools on SRTB. Thirdly, the experiment scenarios are operated, monitored, and analyzed. The 
security researchers operate the security research scenarios using the NS or shell script. When 
the  security  research  scenario  is  operated,  the  results  of  monitoring  and  inspection  by 
monitoring  tools  are  produced  in  many  different  forms.  The  results  are  analyzed  by  the 
statistical techniques and data mining methods. The visualization of results is also reported in 
GUI environment. Lastly, when the security research scenario and analysis are completed, the 
assigned resources are withdrawn to the SRTB administrator. And the produced results by the

The  multi-tenancy  function  of  SRTB  provides  many  functions  concurrently  including 
digital  forensic  analysis  tools  (i.e.,  EnCase  [9],  FTK  [10],  etc.,)  for  monitoring  and 
implements computing and networking forensic. Results of forensic processing are analyzed, 
audited and reported, as shown in Figure 7. 
 
6. Conclusion 

This study is conducted pilot research to propose a security research testbed based on 
cloud  computing  and  described  2  case  study  scenarios  of  cyber-quarantine  and  cyber-
criminal  investigation  using  SRTB.  Further  study  is  required  to  develop  in  order  to  a 
prototype to improve testbed environment and functions proposed in the pilot research.
