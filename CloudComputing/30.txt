ABSTRACT 
 

Cloud computing is the newest term for the ongoing-dreamed vision of computing as 
a utility. The cloud provides convenient, on-demand network access to a centralized pool of 
configurable  computing  resources  that  can  be  rapidly  deployed  with  great  efficiency  and 
minimal  management  overhead.  The  industry  leaders  and  customers  have  wide-ranging 
expectations for cloud computing in which   security concerns remain a major aspect Dealing 
with  “single  cloud”  providers  is  becoming  less  popular  with  customers  due  to  potential 
problems  such  as  service  availability  failure  and  the  possibility  that  there  are  malicious 
insiders  in  the  single  cloud.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  move  towards  “multiclouds”, 
“intercloud”  or  “cloud-of-clouds”.  The  proposed  design  allows  users  to  audit  the  cloud 
storage  with  very  light  weight  communication  and  computation  cost.  Our  scheme  achieves 
the storage correctness insurance as well as data error localization: whenever data corruption 
has  been  detected  during  the  storage  correctness  verification,  our  scheme  can  almost 
guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of  data  errors,  i.e.,  the  identification  of  the 
misbehaving server(s).

This  paper  focuses  on  the  issues  related  to  the  data  security  aspect  of  cloud 
computing. As data and information will be shared with a third party, cloud computing users 
want  to  avoid  an  un-trusted  cloud  provider.  Protecting  private  and  important  information, 
such as credit card details or a patient’s medical records from attackers or malicious insiders 
is  of  critical  importance.  In  addition,  the  potential  for  migration  from  a  single  cloud  to  a 
multi-cloud  environment  is  examined  and  research  related  to  security  issues  in  single  and 
multi-clouds in cloud computing is surveyed. 
 
ADV. OF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
 
Data Integrity 

One of the most important issues related to cloud security risks is data integrity. The 
data stored in the cloud may suffer from damage during transition operations from or to the 
cloud storage provider. Cachinet al. give examples of the risk of attacks from both inside and 
outside the cloud provider, such as the recently attacked Red Hat Linux’s distribution servers. 
One of the solutions that they propose is to use a Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol 
within the cloud. Hendricks et al. State that this solution can avoid data corruption caused by 
some  components  in  the  cloud.  However,  Cachinet  al.  Claim  that  using  the  Byzantine  fault 
tolerant  replication  protocol  within  the  cloud  is  unsuitable  due  to  the  fact  that  the  servers 
belonging to cloud providers use the same system installations and are physically located in 
the same place. 
 
Service Availability 

Another major concern in cloud services is service availability. Amazon mentions in 
its licensing agreement  that  it  is  possible  that  the  service might be  unavailable  from  time to 
time.  The  user’s  web  service  may  terminate  for  any  reason  at  any  time  if  any  user’s  files 
break the cloud storage policy. In addition, if any damage occurs to any Amazon web service 
and  the  service  fails,  in  this  case  there  will  be  no  charge  to  the  Amazon  Company  for  this 
failure.  Companies  seeking  to  protect  services  from  such  failure  need  measures  such  as 
backups or use of multiple providers. 
 
3. SECURITY RISKS IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
 

The state of preventing a system from vulnerable attacks is considered as the system’s 
security. Security risks involved with the governmental use of cloud computing have various 
risk factors. Seven important identity factors for risk in a cloud computing model are: Access, 
Network load, Data Security, Data Location and Data Segregation.  
 
3.1 Access   

The  data  in  a  private  organization  allows  only  the  Authenticated  users  to  access  the 
data. The access privilege must be provided only to the concerned customers and auditors in 
order to minimize such risks. When there is an access from an internal to external source, the 
possibility of risk is more in case of sensitive data. Segregation of the data is very important 
in  cloud  computing  as  the  data  is  distributed  over  a  network  of  physical  devices.  Data 
Corruption arises if appropriate segregation is not maintained. Currently, there are no federal 
policies addressing how government information is accessed.

January- June (2014) 

3.2 Network Load  

Cloud  network  load  can  also  prove  to  be  detrimental  to  performance  of  the  cloud 
computing  system.  If  the  capacity  of  the  cloud  is  greater  than  80%,  then  the  computers  can 
become unresponsive due to high volumes .The computers and the servers crash due to high 
volume  motion  of  data  between  the  disk  and  the  computer  memory.  The  percentage  of 
capacity threshold also poses a risk to the cloud users. When the threshold exceeds 80%, the 
vendors protect their Services and pass the degradation on to customers. It has been indicated 
that  in  certain  cases  the  outage  of  the  system  to  the  users  are  still  not  accessed.    Flexibility 
and  scalability  should  be  considered  pivotal  when  designing  and  implementing  a  cloud 
infrastructure. Money and time also plays an important role in the design of the infrastructure. 
Customers  will always  have expectations  on  the durability and  the efficiency  of  the system.  
Going Forward the customers will also demand the need of Interoperability, ability to switch 
providers  and  migration  options.  Another  risk  factor  of  cloud  computing 
the 
implementation of the application programming interfaces (API). 
 
3.3 Data Security  

is 

Another  key  criterion  in  a  cloud  is  the  data  security.  Data  has  to  be  appropriately 
secured from the outside world. This is necessary to ensure that data is protected and is less 
prone  to  corruption.  With  cloud  computing  becoming  an  upcoming  trend,  a  number  of 
vulnerabilities  could  arise  when  the  data  is  being  indiscriminately  shared  among  the  varied 
systems  in  cloud  computing.  Trust  is  an  important  factor  which  is  missing  in  the  present 
models  as  the  service  providers  use  diversified  mechanisms  which  do  not  have  proper 
security  measures.  The  following  sub  section  describes  the  risks  factors  in  cloud 
environments. 
 
3.4 Data Location  

Data  Location  is  another  aspect  in  cloud  computing  where  service  providers  are  not 
concentrated  in  a  single  location  but  are  distributed  throughout  the  globe.  It  creates 
unawareness  among  the  customers  about  the  exact  location  of  the  cloud.  This  could  hinder 
investigations  within the  cloud and  is  difficult to  access  the  activity  of  the cloud,  where the 
data is not stored in a particular data centre but in a distributed format. The users may not be 
familiar with the underlying environments of the varied components in the cloud. 
 
3.5 Data Segregation  

Data  Segregation  is  not  easily  facilitated  in  all  cloud  Environments  as  all  the  data 
cannot be segregated according to the user needs. Some customers do not encrypt the data as 
there are chances for the encryption itself to destroy the data. In short, cloud computing is not 
an environment which works in a toolkit. The compromised servers are shut down Whenever 
a data is needed to be recovered. The available data is not correctly sent to the customer at all 
times  of  need.  When  recovering  the  data  there  could  be  instances  of  replication  of  data  in 
multiple  sites.  The  restoration  of  data  must  be  quick  and  complete  to  avoid  further  risks.In 
different  cloud  service  models,  the  security  responsibility  between  users  and  providers  is 
different. According to Amazon, their EC2 addresses security control in relation to physical, 
environmental,  and  virtualization  security,  whereas,  the  users  remain  responsible  for 
addressing security control of the IT system including the operating systems, applications and 
data.

ABSTRACT 
 

Cloud computing is the newest term for the ongoing-dreamed vision of computing as 
a utility. The cloud provides convenient, on-demand network access to a centralized pool of 
configurable  computing  resources  that  can  be  rapidly  deployed  with  great  efficiency  and 
minimal  management  overhead.  The  industry  leaders  and  customers  have  wide-ranging 
expectations for cloud computing in which   security concerns remain a major aspect Dealing 
with  “single  cloud”  providers  is  becoming  less  popular  with  customers  due  to  potential 
problems  such  as  service  availability  failure  and  the  possibility  that  there  are  malicious 
insiders  in  the  single  cloud.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  move  towards  “multiclouds”, 
“intercloud”  or  “cloud-of-clouds”.  The  proposed  design  allows  users  to  audit  the  cloud 
storage  with  very  light  weight  communication  and  computation  cost.  Our  scheme  achieves 
the storage correctness insurance as well as data error localization: whenever data corruption 
has  been  detected  during  the  storage  correctness  verification,  our  scheme  can  almost 
guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of  data  errors,  i.e.,  the  identification  of  the 
misbehaving server(s).

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Cloud  computing  security  (sometimes  referred  to  simply  as  "cloud  security")  is  a 
growing sub-domain of computer security, network security, and, more broadly, information 
security.  It  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies,  and  controls  deployed  to  protect 
data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. Cloud security is not 
to be confused with security software offerings that are "cloud-based" (security-as-a-service). 
In a cloud computing environment, the original computing infrastructure is used only when it 
is  needed.  For  example,  in  order  to  process  a  user  request,  a  service  provider  can  draw  the 
required  resources  on-demand,  perform  a  specific  job  and  then  resign  the  not  required

resources and often arrange them after the job is complete. Contrary to traditional computing 
paradigms,  in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the 
service provider. This leads to a natural concern about data safety and also its protection from 
internal as well as external threats. Usually, in a cloud computing paradigm, data storage and 
computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter.  There  can  be  various  security  related 
advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment.  However,  a  single  point  of  failure 
cannot  be  assumed  for  any  data  loss.  the  data  may  be  located  at  several  geographically 
distributed  nodes  in  the  cloud.  There  may  be  multiple  points  where  a  security  breach  can 
occur. Compared to a traditional in house computing, it might be difficult to track the security 
breach in a cloud computing environment.The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly 
in  many  organizations.  Small  and  medium  companies  use  cloud  computing  services  for 
various reasons, including because these services provide fast access to their applications and 
reduce  their  infrastructure costs. Cloud  providers should  address  privacy and  security  issues 
as a matter of high and urgent priority.Dealing with “single cloud” providers is becoming less 
popular with customers due to potential problems such as service availability failure and the 
possibility that there are malicious insiders in the single cloud. In recent years, there has been 
a move towards “multi-clouds”, “intercloud” or “cloud-of-clouds”. 

Cloud  Computing  provides  Internet-based  services, computing,  and storage  for  users 
in  all  markets  including  financial,  healthcare,  and  government  and  those  underlying 
computing infrastructure is used only when it is needed. In traditional computing paradigms, 
in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the  service 
provider.  This  leads  to  a  natural  concern  about  data  safety  and  also  its  protection  from 
internal  as  well  as  external  threats.  Despite  of  this,  advantages  such  as-On  demand 
infrastructure, pay as you go, reduced cost of maintenance, elastic scaling etc. are compelling 
reasons  for  enterprises  to  decide  on  cloud  computing  environments.  Usually,  in  a  cloud 
computing  paradigm,  data  storage  and  computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter. 
There  can  be  various  security  related  advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment. 
However, a single point of failure cannot be assumed for any data loss.

January- June (2014) 

This  paper  focuses  on  the  issues  related  to  the  data  security  aspect  of  cloud 
computing. As data and information will be shared with a third party, cloud computing users 
want  to  avoid  an  un-trusted  cloud  provider.  Protecting  private  and  important  information, 
such as credit card details or a patient’s medical records from attackers or malicious insiders 
is  of  critical  importance.  In  addition,  the  potential  for  migration  from  a  single  cloud  to  a 
multi-cloud  environment  is  examined  and  research  related  to  security  issues  in  single  and 
multi-clouds in cloud computing is surveyed. 
 
ADV. OF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
 
Data Integrity 

One of the most important issues related to cloud security risks is data integrity. The 
data stored in the cloud may suffer from damage during transition operations from or to the 
cloud storage provider. Cachinet al. give examples of the risk of attacks from both inside and 
outside the cloud provider, such as the recently attacked Red Hat Linux’s distribution servers. 
One of the solutions that they propose is to use a Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol 
within the cloud. Hendricks et al. State that this solution can avoid data corruption caused by 
some  components  in  the  cloud.  However,  Cachinet  al.  Claim  that  using  the  Byzantine  fault 
tolerant  replication  protocol  within  the  cloud  is  unsuitable  due  to  the  fact  that  the  servers 
belonging to cloud providers use the same system installations and are physically located in 
the same place. 
 
Service Availability 

Another major concern in cloud services is service availability. Amazon mentions in 
its licensing agreement  that  it  is  possible  that  the  service might be  unavailable  from  time to 
time.  The  user’s  web  service  may  terminate  for  any  reason  at  any  time  if  any  user’s  files 
break the cloud storage policy. In addition, if any damage occurs to any Amazon web service 
and  the  service  fails,  in  this  case  there  will  be  no  charge  to  the  Amazon  Company  for  this 
failure.  Companies  seeking  to  protect  services  from  such  failure  need  measures  such  as 
backups or use of multiple providers. 
 
3. SECURITY RISKS IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
 

The state of preventing a system from vulnerable attacks is considered as the system’s 
security. Security risks involved with the governmental use of cloud computing have various 
risk factors. Seven important identity factors for risk in a cloud computing model are: Access, 
Network load, Data Security, Data Location and Data Segregation.  
 
3.1 Access   

The  data  in  a  private  organization  allows  only  the  Authenticated  users  to  access  the 
data. The access privilege must be provided only to the concerned customers and auditors in 
order to minimize such risks. When there is an access from an internal to external source, the 
possibility of risk is more in case of sensitive data. Segregation of the data is very important 
in  cloud  computing  as  the  data  is  distributed  over  a  network  of  physical  devices.  Data 
Corruption arises if appropriate segregation is not maintained. Currently, there are no federal 
policies addressing how government information is accessed.

January- June (2014) 

3.2 Network Load  

Cloud  network  load  can  also  prove  to  be  detrimental  to  performance  of  the  cloud 
computing  system.  If  the  capacity  of  the  cloud  is  greater  than  80%,  then  the  computers  can 
become unresponsive due to high volumes .The computers and the servers crash due to high 
volume  motion  of  data  between  the  disk  and  the  computer  memory.  The  percentage  of 
capacity threshold also poses a risk to the cloud users. When the threshold exceeds 80%, the 
vendors protect their Services and pass the degradation on to customers. It has been indicated 
that  in  certain  cases  the  outage  of  the  system  to  the  users  are  still  not  accessed.    Flexibility 
and  scalability  should  be  considered  pivotal  when  designing  and  implementing  a  cloud 
infrastructure. Money and time also plays an important role in the design of the infrastructure. 
Customers  will always  have expectations  on  the durability and  the efficiency  of  the system.  
Going Forward the customers will also demand the need of Interoperability, ability to switch 
providers  and  migration  options.  Another  risk  factor  of  cloud  computing 
the 
implementation of the application programming interfaces (API). 
 
3.3 Data Security  

is 

Another  key  criterion  in  a  cloud  is  the  data  security.  Data  has  to  be  appropriately 
secured from the outside world. This is necessary to ensure that data is protected and is less 
prone  to  corruption.  With  cloud  computing  becoming  an  upcoming  trend,  a  number  of 
vulnerabilities  could  arise  when  the  data  is  being  indiscriminately  shared  among  the  varied 
systems  in  cloud  computing.  Trust  is  an  important  factor  which  is  missing  in  the  present 
models  as  the  service  providers  use  diversified  mechanisms  which  do  not  have  proper 
security  measures.  The  following  sub  section  describes  the  risks  factors  in  cloud 
environments. 
 
3.4 Data Location  

Data  Location  is  another  aspect  in  cloud  computing  where  service  providers  are  not 
concentrated  in  a  single  location  but  are  distributed  throughout  the  globe.  It  creates 
unawareness  among  the  customers  about  the  exact  location  of  the  cloud.  This  could  hinder 
investigations  within the  cloud and  is  difficult to  access  the  activity  of  the cloud,  where the 
data is not stored in a particular data centre but in a distributed format. The users may not be 
familiar with the underlying environments of the varied components in the cloud. 
 
3.5 Data Segregation  

Data  Segregation  is  not  easily  facilitated  in  all  cloud  Environments  as  all  the  data 
cannot be segregated according to the user needs. Some customers do not encrypt the data as 
there are chances for the encryption itself to destroy the data. In short, cloud computing is not 
an environment which works in a toolkit. The compromised servers are shut down Whenever 
a data is needed to be recovered. The available data is not correctly sent to the customer at all 
times  of  need.  When  recovering  the  data  there  could  be  instances  of  replication  of  data  in 
multiple  sites.  The  restoration  of  data  must  be  quick  and  complete  to  avoid  further  risks.In 
different  cloud  service  models,  the  security  responsibility  between  users  and  providers  is 
different. According to Amazon, their EC2 addresses security control in relation to physical, 
environmental,  and  virtualization  security,  whereas,  the  users  remain  responsible  for 
addressing security control of the IT system including the operating systems, applications and 
data.

4. ALGORITHM USED 
 
Secret Sharing Algorithm 

Data stored  in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to come up with a 
way to secure those files. We can encrypt them before storing them in the cloud, which sorts 
out the disclosure aspects. However, what if the data is lost due to some catastrophe befalling 
the cloud service provider? We could store it on more than one cloud service and encrypt it 
before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we use an insecure, easily 
guessable  password  to  protect  the  file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect  all  files?  I  have  often 
thought  that  secret  sharing  algorithms  could  be  employed  to  good  effect  in  these 
circumstances  instead.In  cryptography,  secret  sharing  refers  to  a  method  for  distributing  a 
secret amongst a  group of  participants, each  of which  is allocated a share  of  the  secret.  The 
secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together; individual shares are 
of no use on their own.Data stored in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to 
come  up  with  a  way  to  secure  those  files.  We  can  encrypt  them  before  storing  them  in  the 
cloud,  which sorts  out  the  disclosure  aspects.  However, what  if  the  data is  lost  due  to  some 
catastrophe  befalling  the  cloud  service  provider?  We  could  store  it  on  more  than  one  cloud 
service and encrypt it before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we 
use  an  insecure, easily  guessable  password to  protect  the file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect all 
files? I have often thought that secret sharing algorithms could be employed to good effect in 
these circumstances instead. that will share a secret between several parties, such that none of 
them can know the secret without the help of others. Either all or a subset of them will need 
to get together and put their parts together to obtain the original secret. A simplistic solution 
can be achieved by XOR ing the secret with a random number, then giving the result to one 
party  and  the  random  number  to  the  other.  Neither  one  can  find  out  what  the  secret  was 
without the other. To retrieve the secret they only need to XOR the two parts together again. 
This can be extended to any number of parties. A more sophisticated way would be to allow 
the  secret  to  be  retrieved  from  a  subset  of  the  parts  distributed.  In  the  previous  example,  if 
any of the parties loses their part, or refuses to disclose it, then nobody can reveal the secret. 
This isn't much good if one of our cloud service providers fails. On the other hand, if we can 
share  the  secret  between  three  people,  but  only  require  any  two  to  regenerate  the  original, 
then we have some redundancy. This is an example of a (k,n) threshold scheme with k=2 and 
n=3.How  do  we  achieve  this  though?  Well,  Adi  Shamir  proposed  a  simple  secure  secret 
sharing algorithm. It is based on drawing graphs. To uniquely define a straight line, you need 
two points on that line. Similarly, to define a parabola you need three points. A cubic requires 
four, etc. So, we can distribute points on a line to each party we want to share the secret with. 
The order of the line will determine how many of them need to get together to regenerate it. 
So, we could define a random straight line and distribute three points on it to three different 
parties. However, only two of them need to get together to regenerate the original secret.We 
set  up  a  (k,n)  threshold  scheme  by  setting  the  free  coefficient  to  be  the  secret  and  then 
choosing  random  numbers  for  each  of  the  other  coefficients.  The  polynomial  then  becomes 
the following: 
 

  
 

 

where  a0  is  our  secret.  Now  we  can  distribute  points  on  the  line  to  each  of  the  n 
parties simply by calculating y for a series of different values for x. We can use the Lagrange

capacity threshold also poses a risk to the cloud users. When the threshold exceeds 80%, the 
vendors protect their Services and pass the degradation on to customers. It has been indicated 
that  in  certain  cases  the  outage  of  the  system  to  the  users  are  still  not  accessed.    Flexibility 
and  scalability  should  be  considered  pivotal  when  designing  and  implementing  a  cloud 
infrastructure. Money and time also plays an important role in the design of the infrastructure. 
Customers  will always  have expectations  on  the durability and  the efficiency  of  the system.  
Going Forward the customers will also demand the need of Interoperability, ability to switch 
providers  and  migration  options.  Another  risk  factor  of  cloud  computing 
the 
implementation of the application programming interfaces (API). 
 
3.3 Data Security  

is 

Another  key  criterion  in  a  cloud  is  the  data  security.  Data  has  to  be  appropriately 
secured from the outside world. This is necessary to ensure that data is protected and is less 
prone  to  corruption.  With  cloud  computing  becoming  an  upcoming  trend,  a  number  of 
vulnerabilities  could  arise  when  the  data  is  being  indiscriminately  shared  among  the  varied 
systems  in  cloud  computing.  Trust  is  an  important  factor  which  is  missing  in  the  present 
models  as  the  service  providers  use  diversified  mechanisms  which  do  not  have  proper 
security  measures.  The  following  sub  section  describes  the  risks  factors  in  cloud 
environments. 
 
3.4 Data Location  

Data  Location  is  another  aspect  in  cloud  computing  where  service  providers  are  not 
concentrated  in  a  single  location  but  are  distributed  throughout  the  globe.  It  creates 
unawareness  among  the  customers  about  the  exact  location  of  the  cloud.  This  could  hinder 
investigations  within the  cloud and  is  difficult to  access  the  activity  of  the cloud,  where the 
data is not stored in a particular data centre but in a distributed format. The users may not be 
familiar with the underlying environments of the varied components in the cloud. 
 
3.5 Data Segregation  

Data  Segregation  is  not  easily  facilitated  in  all  cloud  Environments  as  all  the  data 
cannot be segregated according to the user needs. Some customers do not encrypt the data as 
there are chances for the encryption itself to destroy the data. In short, cloud computing is not 
an environment which works in a toolkit. The compromised servers are shut down Whenever 
a data is needed to be recovered. The available data is not correctly sent to the customer at all 
times  of  need.  When  recovering  the  data  there  could  be  instances  of  replication  of  data  in 
multiple  sites.  The  restoration  of  data  must  be  quick  and  complete  to  avoid  further  risks.In 
different  cloud  service  models,  the  security  responsibility  between  users  and  providers  is 
different. According to Amazon, their EC2 addresses security control in relation to physical, 
environmental,  and  virtualization  security,  whereas,  the  users  remain  responsible  for 
addressing security control of the IT system including the operating systems, applications and 
data.

4. ALGORITHM USED 
 
Secret Sharing Algorithm 

Data stored  in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to come up with a 
way to secure those files. We can encrypt them before storing them in the cloud, which sorts 
out the disclosure aspects. However, what if the data is lost due to some catastrophe befalling 
the cloud service provider? We could store it on more than one cloud service and encrypt it 
before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we use an insecure, easily 
guessable  password  to  protect  the  file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect  all  files?  I  have  often 
thought  that  secret  sharing  algorithms  could  be  employed  to  good  effect  in  these 
circumstances  instead.In  cryptography,  secret  sharing  refers  to  a  method  for  distributing  a 
secret amongst a  group of  participants, each  of which  is allocated a share  of  the  secret.  The 
secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together; individual shares are 
of no use on their own.Data stored in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to 
come  up  with  a  way  to  secure  those  files.  We  can  encrypt  them  before  storing  them  in  the 
cloud,  which sorts  out  the  disclosure  aspects.  However, what  if  the  data is  lost  due  to  some 
catastrophe  befalling  the  cloud  service  provider?  We  could  store  it  on  more  than  one  cloud 
service and encrypt it before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we 
use  an  insecure, easily  guessable  password to  protect  the file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect all 
files? I have often thought that secret sharing algorithms could be employed to good effect in 
these circumstances instead. that will share a secret between several parties, such that none of 
them can know the secret without the help of others. Either all or a subset of them will need 
to get together and put their parts together to obtain the original secret. A simplistic solution 
can be achieved by XOR ing the secret with a random number, then giving the result to one 
party  and  the  random  number  to  the  other.  Neither  one  can  find  out  what  the  secret  was 
without the other. To retrieve the secret they only need to XOR the two parts together again. 
This can be extended to any number of parties. A more sophisticated way would be to allow 
the  secret  to  be  retrieved  from  a  subset  of  the  parts  distributed.  In  the  previous  example,  if 
any of the parties loses their part, or refuses to disclose it, then nobody can reveal the secret. 
This isn't much good if one of our cloud service providers fails. On the other hand, if we can 
share  the  secret  between  three  people,  but  only  require  any  two  to  regenerate  the  original, 
then we have some redundancy. This is an example of a (k,n) threshold scheme with k=2 and 
n=3.How  do  we  achieve  this  though?  Well,  Adi  Shamir  proposed  a  simple  secure  secret 
sharing algorithm. It is based on drawing graphs. To uniquely define a straight line, you need 
two points on that line. Similarly, to define a parabola you need three points. A cubic requires 
four, etc. So, we can distribute points on a line to each party we want to share the secret with. 
The order of the line will determine how many of them need to get together to regenerate it. 
So, we could define a random straight line and distribute three points on it to three different 
parties. However, only two of them need to get together to regenerate the original secret.We 
set  up  a  (k,n)  threshold  scheme  by  setting  the  free  coefficient  to  be  the  secret  and  then 
choosing  random  numbers  for  each  of  the  other  coefficients.  The  polynomial  then  becomes 
the following: 
 

  
 

 

where  a0  is  our  secret.  Now  we  can  distribute  points  on  the  line  to  each  of  the  n 
parties simply by calculating y for a series of different values for x. We can use the Lagrange

ABSTRACT 
 

Cloud computing is the newest term for the ongoing-dreamed vision of computing as 
a utility. The cloud provides convenient, on-demand network access to a centralized pool of 
configurable  computing  resources  that  can  be  rapidly  deployed  with  great  efficiency  and 
minimal  management  overhead.  The  industry  leaders  and  customers  have  wide-ranging 
expectations for cloud computing in which   security concerns remain a major aspect Dealing 
with  “single  cloud”  providers  is  becoming  less  popular  with  customers  due  to  potential 
problems  such  as  service  availability  failure  and  the  possibility  that  there  are  malicious 
insiders  in  the  single  cloud.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  move  towards  “multiclouds”, 
“intercloud”  or  “cloud-of-clouds”.  The  proposed  design  allows  users  to  audit  the  cloud 
storage  with  very  light  weight  communication  and  computation  cost.  Our  scheme  achieves 
the storage correctness insurance as well as data error localization: whenever data corruption 
has  been  detected  during  the  storage  correctness  verification,  our  scheme  can  almost 
guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of  data  errors,  i.e.,  the  identification  of  the 
misbehaving server(s).

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Cloud  computing  security  (sometimes  referred  to  simply  as  "cloud  security")  is  a 
growing sub-domain of computer security, network security, and, more broadly, information 
security.  It  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies,  and  controls  deployed  to  protect 
data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. Cloud security is not 
to be confused with security software offerings that are "cloud-based" (security-as-a-service). 
In a cloud computing environment, the original computing infrastructure is used only when it 
is  needed.  For  example,  in  order  to  process  a  user  request,  a  service  provider  can  draw  the 
required  resources  on-demand,  perform  a  specific  job  and  then  resign  the  not  required

International  Journal  of  Information  Technology  (IJIT),  Volume  1,  Number  1, 
January- June (2014) 

resources and often arrange them after the job is complete. Contrary to traditional computing 
paradigms,  in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the 
service provider. This leads to a natural concern about data safety and also its protection from 
internal as well as external threats. Usually, in a cloud computing paradigm, data storage and 
computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter.  There  can  be  various  security  related 
advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment.  However,  a  single  point  of  failure 
cannot  be  assumed  for  any  data  loss.  the  data  may  be  located  at  several  geographically 
distributed  nodes  in  the  cloud.  There  may  be  multiple  points  where  a  security  breach  can 
occur. Compared to a traditional in house computing, it might be difficult to track the security 
breach in a cloud computing environment.The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly 
in  many  organizations.  Small  and  medium  companies  use  cloud  computing  services  for 
various reasons, including because these services provide fast access to their applications and 
reduce  their  infrastructure costs. Cloud  providers should  address  privacy and  security  issues 
as a matter of high and urgent priority.Dealing with “single cloud” providers is becoming less 
popular with customers due to potential problems such as service availability failure and the 
possibility that there are malicious insiders in the single cloud. In recent years, there has been 
a move towards “multi-clouds”, “intercloud” or “cloud-of-clouds”. 

Cloud  Computing  provides  Internet-based  services, computing,  and storage  for  users 
in  all  markets  including  financial,  healthcare,  and  government  and  those  underlying 
computing infrastructure is used only when it is needed. In traditional computing paradigms, 
in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the  service 
provider.  This  leads  to  a  natural  concern  about  data  safety  and  also  its  protection  from 
internal  as  well  as  external  threats.  Despite  of  this,  advantages  such  as-On  demand 
infrastructure, pay as you go, reduced cost of maintenance, elastic scaling etc. are compelling 
reasons  for  enterprises  to  decide  on  cloud  computing  environments.  Usually,  in  a  cloud 
computing  paradigm,  data  storage  and  computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter. 
There  can  be  various  security  related  advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment. 
However, a single point of failure cannot be assumed for any data loss. 
 
2.  PROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
 

 

 

Figure 1: System  Architecture

International  Journal  of  Information  Technology  (IJIT),  Volume  1,  Number  1, 
January- June (2014) 

This  paper  focuses  on  the  issues  related  to  the  data  security  aspect  of  cloud 
computing. As data and information will be shared with a third party, cloud computing users 
want  to  avoid  an  un-trusted  cloud  provider.  Protecting  private  and  important  information, 
such as credit card details or a patient’s medical records from attackers or malicious insiders 
is  of  critical  importance.  In  addition,  the  potential  for  migration  from  a  single  cloud  to  a 
multi-cloud  environment  is  examined  and  research  related  to  security  issues  in  single  and 
multi-clouds in cloud computing is surveyed. 
 
ADV. OF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
 
Data Integrity 

One of the most important issues related to cloud security risks is data integrity. The 
data stored in the cloud may suffer from damage during transition operations from or to the 
cloud storage provider. Cachinet al. give examples of the risk of attacks from both inside and 
outside the cloud provider, such as the recently attacked Red Hat Linux’s distribution servers. 
One of the solutions that they propose is to use a Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol 
within the cloud. Hendricks et al. State that this solution can avoid data corruption caused by 
some  components  in  the  cloud.  However,  Cachinet  al.  Claim  that  using  the  Byzantine  fault 
tolerant  replication  protocol  within  the  cloud  is  unsuitable  due  to  the  fact  that  the  servers 
belonging to cloud providers use the same system installations and are physically located in 
the same place. 
 
Service Availability 

Another major concern in cloud services is service availability. Amazon mentions in 
its licensing agreement  that  it  is  possible  that  the  service might be  unavailable  from  time to 
time.  The  user’s  web  service  may  terminate  for  any  reason  at  any  time  if  any  user’s  files 
break the cloud storage policy. In addition, if any damage occurs to any Amazon web service 
and  the  service  fails,  in  this  case  there  will  be  no  charge  to  the  Amazon  Company  for  this 
failure.  Companies  seeking  to  protect  services  from  such  failure  need  measures  such  as 
backups or use of multiple providers. 
 
3. SECURITY RISKS IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
 

The state of preventing a system from vulnerable attacks is considered as the system’s 
security. Security risks involved with the governmental use of cloud computing have various 
risk factors. Seven important identity factors for risk in a cloud computing model are: Access, 
Network load, Data Security, Data Location and Data Segregation.  
 
3.1 Access   

The  data  in  a  private  organization  allows  only  the  Authenticated  users  to  access  the 
data. The access privilege must be provided only to the concerned customers and auditors in 
order to minimize such risks. When there is an access from an internal to external source, the 
possibility of risk is more in case of sensitive data. Segregation of the data is very important 
in  cloud  computing  as  the  data  is  distributed  over  a  network  of  physical  devices.  Data 
Corruption arises if appropriate segregation is not maintained. Currently, there are no federal 
policies addressing how government information is accessed.

January- June (2014) 

3.2 Network Load  

Cloud  network  load  can  also  prove  to  be  detrimental  to  performance  of  the  cloud 
computing  system.  If  the  capacity  of  the  cloud  is  greater  than  80%,  then  the  computers  can 
become unresponsive due to high volumes .The computers and the servers crash due to high 
volume  motion  of  data  between  the  disk  and  the  computer  memory.  The  percentage  of 
capacity threshold also poses a risk to the cloud users. When the threshold exceeds 80%, the 
vendors protect their Services and pass the degradation on to customers. It has been indicated 
that  in  certain  cases  the  outage  of  the  system  to  the  users  are  still  not  accessed.    Flexibility 
and  scalability  should  be  considered  pivotal  when  designing  and  implementing  a  cloud 
infrastructure. Money and time also plays an important role in the design of the infrastructure. 
Customers  will always  have expectations  on  the durability and  the efficiency  of  the system.  
Going Forward the customers will also demand the need of Interoperability, ability to switch 
providers  and  migration  options.  Another  risk  factor  of  cloud  computing 
the 
implementation of the application programming interfaces (API). 
 
3.3 Data Security  

is 

Another  key  criterion  in  a  cloud  is  the  data  security.  Data  has  to  be  appropriately 
secured from the outside world. This is necessary to ensure that data is protected and is less 
prone  to  corruption.  With  cloud  computing  becoming  an  upcoming  trend,  a  number  of 
vulnerabilities  could  arise  when  the  data  is  being  indiscriminately  shared  among  the  varied 
systems  in  cloud  computing.  Trust  is  an  important  factor  which  is  missing  in  the  present 
models  as  the  service  providers  use  diversified  mechanisms  which  do  not  have  proper 
security  measures.  The  following  sub  section  describes  the  risks  factors  in  cloud 
environments. 
 
3.4 Data Location  

Data  Location  is  another  aspect  in  cloud  computing  where  service  providers  are  not 
concentrated  in  a  single  location  but  are  distributed  throughout  the  globe.  It  creates 
unawareness  among  the  customers  about  the  exact  location  of  the  cloud.  This  could  hinder 
investigations  within the  cloud and  is  difficult to  access  the  activity  of  the cloud,  where the 
data is not stored in a particular data centre but in a distributed format. The users may not be 
familiar with the underlying environments of the varied components in the cloud. 
 
3.5 Data Segregation  

Data  Segregation  is  not  easily  facilitated  in  all  cloud  Environments  as  all  the  data 
cannot be segregated according to the user needs. Some customers do not encrypt the data as 
there are chances for the encryption itself to destroy the data. In short, cloud computing is not 
an environment which works in a toolkit. The compromised servers are shut down Whenever 
a data is needed to be recovered. The available data is not correctly sent to the customer at all 
times  of  need.  When  recovering  the  data  there  could  be  instances  of  replication  of  data  in 
multiple  sites.  The  restoration  of  data  must  be  quick  and  complete  to  avoid  further  risks.In 
different  cloud  service  models,  the  security  responsibility  between  users  and  providers  is 
different. According to Amazon, their EC2 addresses security control in relation to physical, 
environmental,  and  virtualization  security,  whereas,  the  users  remain  responsible  for 
addressing security control of the IT system including the operating systems, applications and 
data.

4. ALGORITHM USED 
 
Secret Sharing Algorithm 

Data stored  in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to come up with a 
way to secure those files. We can encrypt them before storing them in the cloud, which sorts 
out the disclosure aspects. However, what if the data is lost due to some catastrophe befalling 
the cloud service provider? We could store it on more than one cloud service and encrypt it 
before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we use an insecure, easily 
guessable  password  to  protect  the  file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect  all  files?  I  have  often 
thought  that  secret  sharing  algorithms  could  be  employed  to  good  effect  in  these 
circumstances  instead.In  cryptography,  secret  sharing  refers  to  a  method  for  distributing  a 
secret amongst a  group of  participants, each  of which  is allocated a share  of  the  secret.  The 
secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together; individual shares are 
of no use on their own.Data stored in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to 
come  up  with  a  way  to  secure  those  files.  We  can  encrypt  them  before  storing  them  in  the 
cloud,  which sorts  out  the  disclosure  aspects.  However, what  if  the  data is  lost  due  to  some 
catastrophe  befalling  the  cloud  service  provider?  We  could  store  it  on  more  than  one  cloud 
service and encrypt it before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we 
use  an  insecure, easily  guessable  password to  protect  the file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect all 
files? I have often thought that secret sharing algorithms could be employed to good effect in 
these circumstances instead. that will share a secret between several parties, such that none of 
them can know the secret without the help of others. Either all or a subset of them will need 
to get together and put their parts together to obtain the original secret. A simplistic solution 
can be achieved by XOR ing the secret with a random number, then giving the result to one 
party  and  the  random  number  to  the  other.  Neither  one  can  find  out  what  the  secret  was 
without the other. To retrieve the secret they only need to XOR the two parts together again. 
This can be extended to any number of parties. A more sophisticated way would be to allow 
the  secret  to  be  retrieved  from  a  subset  of  the  parts  distributed.  In  the  previous  example,  if 
any of the parties loses their part, or refuses to disclose it, then nobody can reveal the secret. 
This isn't much good if one of our cloud service providers fails. On the other hand, if we can 
share  the  secret  between  three  people,  but  only  require  any  two  to  regenerate  the  original, 
then we have some redundancy. This is an example of a (k,n) threshold scheme with k=2 and 
n=3.How  do  we  achieve  this  though?  Well,  Adi  Shamir  proposed  a  simple  secure  secret 
sharing algorithm. It is based on drawing graphs. To uniquely define a straight line, you need 
two points on that line. Similarly, to define a parabola you need three points. A cubic requires 
four, etc. So, we can distribute points on a line to each party we want to share the secret with. 
The order of the line will determine how many of them need to get together to regenerate it. 
So, we could define a random straight line and distribute three points on it to three different 
parties. However, only two of them need to get together to regenerate the original secret.We 
set  up  a  (k,n)  threshold  scheme  by  setting  the  free  coefficient  to  be  the  secret  and  then 
choosing  random  numbers  for  each  of  the  other  coefficients.  The  polynomial  then  becomes 
the following: 
 

  
 

 

where  a0  is  our  secret.  Now  we  can  distribute  points  on  the  line  to  each  of  the  n 
parties simply by calculating y for a series of different values for x. We can use the Lagrange

ABSTRACT 
 

Cloud computing is the newest term for the ongoing-dreamed vision of computing as 
a utility. The cloud provides convenient, on-demand network access to a centralized pool of 
configurable  computing  resources  that  can  be  rapidly  deployed  with  great  efficiency  and 
minimal  management  overhead.  The  industry  leaders  and  customers  have  wide-ranging 
expectations for cloud computing in which   security concerns remain a major aspect Dealing 
with  “single  cloud”  providers  is  becoming  less  popular  with  customers  due  to  potential 
problems  such  as  service  availability  failure  and  the  possibility  that  there  are  malicious 
insiders  in  the  single  cloud.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  move  towards  “multiclouds”, 
“intercloud”  or  “cloud-of-clouds”.  The  proposed  design  allows  users  to  audit  the  cloud 
storage  with  very  light  weight  communication  and  computation  cost.  Our  scheme  achieves 
the storage correctness insurance as well as data error localization: whenever data corruption 
has  been  detected  during  the  storage  correctness  verification,  our  scheme  can  almost 
guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of  data  errors,  i.e.,  the  identification  of  the 
misbehaving server(s).

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Cloud  computing  security  (sometimes  referred  to  simply  as  "cloud  security")  is  a 
growing sub-domain of computer security, network security, and, more broadly, information 
security.  It  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies,  and  controls  deployed  to  protect 
data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. Cloud security is not 
to be confused with security software offerings that are "cloud-based" (security-as-a-service). 
In a cloud computing environment, the original computing infrastructure is used only when it 
is  needed.  For  example,  in  order  to  process  a  user  request,  a  service  provider  can  draw  the 
required  resources  on-demand,  perform  a  specific  job  and  then  resign  the  not  required

resources and often arrange them after the job is complete. Contrary to traditional computing 
paradigms,  in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the 
service provider. This leads to a natural concern about data safety and also its protection from 
internal as well as external threats. Usually, in a cloud computing paradigm, data storage and 
computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter.  There  can  be  various  security  related 
advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment.  However,  a  single  point  of  failure 
cannot  be  assumed  for  any  data  loss.  the  data  may  be  located  at  several  geographically 
distributed  nodes  in  the  cloud.  There  may  be  multiple  points  where  a  security  breach  can 
occur. Compared to a traditional in house computing, it might be difficult to track the security 
breach in a cloud computing environment.The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly 
in  many  organizations.  Small  and  medium  companies  use  cloud  computing  services  for 
various reasons, including because these services provide fast access to their applications and 
reduce  their  infrastructure costs. Cloud  providers should  address  privacy and  security  issues 
as a matter of high and urgent priority.Dealing with “single cloud” providers is becoming less 
popular with customers due to potential problems such as service availability failure and the 
possibility that there are malicious insiders in the single cloud. In recent years, there has been 
a move towards “multi-clouds”, “intercloud” or “cloud-of-clouds”. 

Cloud  Computing  provides  Internet-based  services, computing,  and storage  for  users 
in  all  markets  including  financial,  healthcare,  and  government  and  those  underlying 
computing infrastructure is used only when it is needed. In traditional computing paradigms, 
in  a  cloud  computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  is  controlled  by  the  service 
provider.  This  leads  to  a  natural  concern  about  data  safety  and  also  its  protection  from 
internal  as  well  as  external  threats.  Despite  of  this,  advantages  such  as-On  demand 
infrastructure, pay as you go, reduced cost of maintenance, elastic scaling etc. are compelling 
reasons  for  enterprises  to  decide  on  cloud  computing  environments.  Usually,  in  a  cloud 
computing  paradigm,  data  storage  and  computation  are  performed  in  a  single  datacenter. 
There  can  be  various  security  related  advantages  in  using  a  cloud  computing  environment. 
However, a single point of failure cannot be assumed for any data loss.

January- June (2014) 

This  paper  focuses  on  the  issues  related  to  the  data  security  aspect  of  cloud 
computing. As data and information will be shared with a third party, cloud computing users 
want  to  avoid  an  un-trusted  cloud  provider.  Protecting  private  and  important  information, 
such as credit card details or a patient’s medical records from attackers or malicious insiders 
is  of  critical  importance.  In  addition,  the  potential  for  migration  from  a  single  cloud  to  a 
multi-cloud  environment  is  examined  and  research  related  to  security  issues  in  single  and 
multi-clouds in cloud computing is surveyed. 
 
ADV. OF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
 
Data Integrity 

One of the most important issues related to cloud security risks is data integrity. The 
data stored in the cloud may suffer from damage during transition operations from or to the 
cloud storage provider. Cachinet al. give examples of the risk of attacks from both inside and 
outside the cloud provider, such as the recently attacked Red Hat Linux’s distribution servers. 
One of the solutions that they propose is to use a Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol 
within the cloud. Hendricks et al. State that this solution can avoid data corruption caused by 
some  components  in  the  cloud.  However,  Cachinet  al.  Claim  that  using  the  Byzantine  fault 
tolerant  replication  protocol  within  the  cloud  is  unsuitable  due  to  the  fact  that  the  servers 
belonging to cloud providers use the same system installations and are physically located in 
the same place. 
 
Service Availability 

Another major concern in cloud services is service availability. Amazon mentions in 
its licensing agreement  that  it  is  possible  that  the  service might be  unavailable  from  time to 
time.  The  user’s  web  service  may  terminate  for  any  reason  at  any  time  if  any  user’s  files 
break the cloud storage policy. In addition, if any damage occurs to any Amazon web service 
and  the  service  fails,  in  this  case  there  will  be  no  charge  to  the  Amazon  Company  for  this 
failure.  Companies  seeking  to  protect  services  from  such  failure  need  measures  such  as 
backups or use of multiple providers. 
 
3. SECURITY RISKS IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
 

The state of preventing a system from vulnerable attacks is considered as the system’s 
security. Security risks involved with the governmental use of cloud computing have various 
risk factors. Seven important identity factors for risk in a cloud computing model are: Access, 
Network load, Data Security, Data Location and Data Segregation.  
 
3.1 Access   

The  data  in  a  private  organization  allows  only  the  Authenticated  users  to  access  the 
data. The access privilege must be provided only to the concerned customers and auditors in 
order to minimize such risks. When there is an access from an internal to external source, the 
possibility of risk is more in case of sensitive data. Segregation of the data is very important 
in  cloud  computing  as  the  data  is  distributed  over  a  network  of  physical  devices.  Data 
Corruption arises if appropriate segregation is not maintained. Currently, there are no federal 
policies addressing how government information is accessed.

January- June (2014) 

3.2 Network Load  

Cloud  network  load  can  also  prove  to  be  detrimental  to  performance  of  the  cloud 
computing  system.  If  the  capacity  of  the  cloud  is  greater  than  80%,  then  the  computers  can 
become unresponsive due to high volumes .The computers and the servers crash due to high 
volume  motion  of  data  between  the  disk  and  the  computer  memory.  The  percentage  of 
capacity threshold also poses a risk to the cloud users. When the threshold exceeds 80%, the 
vendors protect their Services and pass the degradation on to customers. It has been indicated 
that  in  certain  cases  the  outage  of  the  system  to  the  users  are  still  not  accessed.    Flexibility 
and  scalability  should  be  considered  pivotal  when  designing  and  implementing  a  cloud 
infrastructure. Money and time also plays an important role in the design of the infrastructure. 
Customers  will always  have expectations  on  the durability and  the efficiency  of  the system.  
Going Forward the customers will also demand the need of Interoperability, ability to switch 
providers  and  migration  options.  Another  risk  factor  of  cloud  computing 
the 
implementation of the application programming interfaces (API). 
 
3.3 Data Security  

is 

Another  key  criterion  in  a  cloud  is  the  data  security.  Data  has  to  be  appropriately 
secured from the outside world. This is necessary to ensure that data is protected and is less 
prone  to  corruption.  With  cloud  computing  becoming  an  upcoming  trend,  a  number  of 
vulnerabilities  could  arise  when  the  data  is  being  indiscriminately  shared  among  the  varied 
systems  in  cloud  computing.  Trust  is  an  important  factor  which  is  missing  in  the  present 
models  as  the  service  providers  use  diversified  mechanisms  which  do  not  have  proper 
security  measures.  The  following  sub  section  describes  the  risks  factors  in  cloud 
environments. 
 
3.4 Data Location  

Data  Location  is  another  aspect  in  cloud  computing  where  service  providers  are  not 
concentrated  in  a  single  location  but  are  distributed  throughout  the  globe.  It  creates 
unawareness  among  the  customers  about  the  exact  location  of  the  cloud.  This  could  hinder 
investigations  within the  cloud and  is  difficult to  access  the  activity  of  the cloud,  where the 
data is not stored in a particular data centre but in a distributed format. The users may not be 
familiar with the underlying environments of the varied components in the cloud. 
 
3.5 Data Segregation  

Data  Segregation  is  not  easily  facilitated  in  all  cloud  Environments  as  all  the  data 
cannot be segregated according to the user needs. Some customers do not encrypt the data as 
there are chances for the encryption itself to destroy the data. In short, cloud computing is not 
an environment which works in a toolkit. The compromised servers are shut down Whenever 
a data is needed to be recovered. The available data is not correctly sent to the customer at all 
times  of  need.  When  recovering  the  data  there  could  be  instances  of  replication  of  data  in 
multiple  sites.  The  restoration  of  data  must  be  quick  and  complete  to  avoid  further  risks.In 
different  cloud  service  models,  the  security  responsibility  between  users  and  providers  is 
different. According to Amazon, their EC2 addresses security control in relation to physical, 
environmental,  and  virtualization  security,  whereas,  the  users  remain  responsible  for 
addressing security control of the IT system including the operating systems, applications and 
data.

4. ALGORITHM USED 
 
Secret Sharing Algorithm 

Data stored  in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to come up with a 
way to secure those files. We can encrypt them before storing them in the cloud, which sorts 
out the disclosure aspects. However, what if the data is lost due to some catastrophe befalling 
the cloud service provider? We could store it on more than one cloud service and encrypt it 
before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we use an insecure, easily 
guessable  password  to  protect  the  file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect  all  files?  I  have  often 
thought  that  secret  sharing  algorithms  could  be  employed  to  good  effect  in  these 
circumstances  instead.In  cryptography,  secret  sharing  refers  to  a  method  for  distributing  a 
secret amongst a  group of  participants, each  of which  is allocated a share  of  the  secret.  The 
secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together; individual shares are 
of no use on their own.Data stored in the cloud can be compromised or lost. So, we have to 
come  up  with  a  way  to  secure  those  files.  We  can  encrypt  them  before  storing  them  in  the 
cloud,  which sorts  out  the  disclosure  aspects.  However, what  if  the  data is  lost  due  to  some 
catastrophe  befalling  the  cloud  service  provider?  We  could  store  it  on  more  than  one  cloud 
service and encrypt it before we send it off. Each of them will have the same file. What if we 
use  an  insecure, easily  guessable  password to  protect  the file,  or  the  same  one  to  protect all 
files? I have often thought that secret sharing algorithms could be employed to good effect in 
these circumstances instead. that will share a secret between several parties, such that none of 
them can know the secret without the help of others. Either all or a subset of them will need 
to get together and put their parts together to obtain the original secret. A simplistic solution 
can be achieved by XOR ing the secret with a random number, then giving the result to one 
party  and  the  random  number  to  the  other.  Neither  one  can  find  out  what  the  secret  was 
without the other. To retrieve the secret they only need to XOR the two parts together again. 
This can be extended to any number of parties. A more sophisticated way would be to allow 
the  secret  to  be  retrieved  from  a  subset  of  the  parts  distributed.  In  the  previous  example,  if 
any of the parties loses their part, or refuses to disclose it, then nobody can reveal the secret. 
This isn't much good if one of our cloud service providers fails. On the other hand, if we can 
share  the  secret  between  three  people,  but  only  require  any  two  to  regenerate  the  original, 
then we have some redundancy. This is an example of a (k,n) threshold scheme with k=2 and 
n=3.How  do  we  achieve  this  though?  Well,  Adi  Shamir  proposed  a  simple  secure  secret 
sharing algorithm. It is based on drawing graphs. To uniquely define a straight line, you need 
two points on that line. Similarly, to define a parabola you need three points. A cubic requires 
four, etc. So, we can distribute points on a line to each party we want to share the secret with. 
The order of the line will determine how many of them need to get together to regenerate it. 
So, we could define a random straight line and distribute three points on it to three different 
parties. However, only two of them need to get together to regenerate the original secret.We 
set  up  a  (k,n)  threshold  scheme  by  setting  the  free  coefficient  to  be  the  secret  and  then 
choosing  random  numbers  for  each  of  the  other  coefficients.  The  polynomial  then  becomes 
the following: 
 

  
 

 

where  a0  is  our  secret.  Now  we  can  distribute  points  on  the  line  to  each  of  the  n 
parties simply by calculating y for a series of different values for x. We can use the Lagrange
