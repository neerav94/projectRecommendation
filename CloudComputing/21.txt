Abstract—As we know that now a days the use of computing services is rapidly increasing over internet, so there is a 
need to buy mainframe system for every enterprise to full fill the requirements of end users and this can be overcome 
by  use  of  cloud  computing  services  in  a  inexpensive  manner.  Cloud  computing  paradigm  offers  a  wide  range  of 
computing services for enterprises in terms of elasticity, service dynamism and highly scalable technology. This paper 
focus  on  the  comparison  of  different  parameters  such  as  (platforms,  language,  integrated  database  etc.),  of  various 
cloud service providers. So it makes very easy for any enterprise to choose the best vendor  of cloud service provider 
according to their requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION  

In  today‟s  scenario  everyone  access  internet  through  the 
most  common  websites  like  Google,  Yahoo.  So  there  is  a 
need  of  some  kind  of  place  over  internet  through  which 
anyone  can  use  the  resources  dynamically  to  develop  and 
deploy applications. This need leads to the invention of cloud 
computing technology, i.e. next higher level in the evolution 
of  Internet.  It  is  a  different  style  of  computing  where 
dynamically  scalable  and  virtualized  resources  are  provided 
as  a  service  over  the  internet  [1].  The  cloud  is  a  collection 
data  center  hardware  and  software,  which  is  responsible  for 
providing services to the clients. In Cloud computing through 
clouds  various  services  is  offered  such  as  computing 
infrastructure, computing power, business processes, personal 
collaboration,  and  applications.  Clouds  are  categorized  into 
three types.  

1.  Public Cloud: - In this the resources are dynamically 
provisioned to the general public on a fine-grained, 
self-service basis over the Internet.  

2.  Private  Cloud:  -  It  is  infrastructure  managed  by 
for  a  single 

third-party  and  operated  solely 
organization.  

3.  Hybrid cloud:- These are combination of Public and 
Private  clouds,    and  offers  the  benefits  to  multiple  
users and clients. 

Cloud Computing moves around three scenarios. In first 
scenario      the  cloud  service  provider  offers  hardware, 
software,  integration,  enable  technology,  infrastructure  and 
application to its clients on demand basis. In Second scenario 
the  Partners  of  this  service  provider  create  different  cloud 
services that are directly accessible to clients and customers. 
In the Last scenario, the Business owner can use and evaluate 
various  types  of  cloud  services  offered  by  the  previous 
scenario. 

This  paper  aims  to  provide  a  better  understanding  of 
various  cloud  service  provider  by  comparing  different 
parameters, so that any business organization or individual is 

capable of choosing the best one according to their financial, 
technical, infrastructure, hardware/software need.

information,  Compatibility  operating 
strategies,  Pricing 
Systems  and languages,  supporting  services  and  many  other 
have  to  be  considered  in  order  to  choose  particular  service 
provider [2]. 
Software as a Service (SaaS)  

  This  is  where  cloud  service  providers  enable  their 
clients  to  get  access  of  infrastructure,  software‟s  etc.  From 
productivity  applications  and  CRM  app„s  suites  to  software 
programs which manage cloud applications and deployments 
and even enable the creation of hybrid clouds, software as a 
service  is  exceptionally  broad  and  runs  the  scope.  Here  we 
consider  cloud  software  and  application  providers  that  are 
performing  in  different  way,  something  new  or  something 
predominantly well [3].   

III. CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE 

There  are    many  different  cloud  computing  services 
present  ,but  they  all  are  characterize  according  to  type  of 
services  offered  .Now  we  examine  the    common  and 
specifice  characteristics  of  Iaas,  Paas,  and  SaaS  cloud 
services.  It  is  likely  that  the  list  can  be  expanded  further, 
however,  the  selected  characteristics  allow  more  clear 
distinctions at each level. 
Common characteristics 

The  shared  characteristics  are  the  license  type,  the 
intended user group, the security offered, formal agreements 
between  the  provider  and  the  customer.  In  the  following 
sections, each of these features will be discussed. 
 License type  

lack 

influence 

the  power  and 

A lot of cloud monitoring software is open-source based, 
as  well  as  smaller  cloud  computing  services,  since  small 
players  often 
to  push 
proprietary  software  on  the  market  [5].  License  types  also 
play  a  role  when  offering  infrastructure-  and  platform-level 
services. IaaS providers do not suffer from software licensing 
issues when renting out their virtual servers without operating 
systems 
including  operating 
systems  and  software  packages,  this  can  cause  potential 
problems as to how the customer should be billed when using 
the service for a limited time period. Often additional fees for 
the software use need to be paid 
 Intended user group 

installed.  However,  when 

Cloud computing services offered are varied according to 
the  users  (private,  public,  corporate).  Mainly  IaaS  and  PaaS 
offerings are intended for companies, whereas SaaS offerings 
exist for corporations, private individuals or both, such as the 
Google Apps [6]. However, this does not imply that services 
aimed  at  companies  cannot  be  purchased  by  individuals.  A 
further  distinction  can  be  made  between  mobile  and  fixed 
users.  Mobile  users  access  their  cloud  computing  services 
from  anywhere  such  as  office,  home  and  from  laptop  or 
desktop.  Fixed  users  are  static  and  always  use  the  same 
device  to  connect  to  the  service.  Once  cloud  computing 
services  intended  to  support  smart  phones  and  other  lower 
source  devices  are  available  an  additional  group,  based  on 
this hardware type, can be considered. 
Security and privacy  

Security and privacy are major aspects, because we know 
very usefull and important data resides on cloud‟s data server. 
Any  kind  of    data leakage and losses  cause  overall profit  of 

company  [7].  There  has  certain  rules  are  implemented  to 
ensure data protection from any loss. 
Formal Agreements 

Service level arguments (formal arguments) define which 

level of service, quality of  service  is given to client  
 [8].  The SLAs include technical specifications of measures, 
such as uptime or turn around time. Most SLAs also describe 
on failure what compensation provided to client. Due to the 
lack  of  standards  most  cloud  service  providers  use  SLA 
agreements  to  convince  potential  customers  to  use  clouds 
“even for mission-critical industrial services. 
IaaS -Specific Characteristics 

The  main  IaaS  specific  characteristics  are  the  available 
operating  system,  software  frameworks  and  applications. 
Mostly IaaS providers support  Open-Solaris , Linux systems, 
and  Windows  .Widely  supported  applications  include  the 
Apache  HTTP  Server  and  the  MySQL  database  software. 
Another  characteristic  that  is  important  for  developers  is 
whether  and  what  kind  of  development  tools  the  provider 
supplies. This could include an API or special command line 
tools [9]. Services comprising virtual instances can be further 
differentiated based on the virtualization technology used. 
PaaS-specific characteristics 

An  important  platform-level  characteristic  is  related  to 
which  programming 
languages  and  environments  are 
supported.  Google‟s  App  Engine,  for  example,  currently 
only supports Python and Java environments. The supported 
operating  systems  and  applications  can  also  be  a  relevant 
feature.[10] 
SaaS-specific characteristics 

Software cloud services vary a lot. A characteristic to be 
considered is the customer/application domain of the offered 
service.  This  domain  could  be  customer  relations  or  other 
business  management  areas,  office  applications,  social 
networking, and data exchange.

feature.[10] 
SaaS-specific characteristics 

Software cloud services vary a lot. A characteristic to be 
considered is the customer/application domain of the offered 
service.  This  domain  could  be  customer  relations  or  other 
business  management  areas,  office  applications,  social

V. CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPARISON 

Below  table describe  the  comparative  analysis  of  four  cloud 
service providers with respective key  features.[12] 

CLOUD COMPUTING CONCERNS 

A.  Security 

There  are  significant  security  concerns  that  need  to  be 
addressed when considering moving critical applications and 
sensitive data to public and shared cloud environments. 

a)  Authentication:  An  authentication  for  a  cloud 
computing environment enables cloud customers to 
retain  control  over  their  enterprise  information 
when  their  applications  are  deployed  in  the  cloud. 
User  authentication  is  a  function  that  service 
providers  offer  to  ensure  that  users  accessing 
resources  (e.g.,  applications,  web  content,  etc.)  are 
authorized to do so. To ensure that a user is not an 
imposter,  service  providers  (e.g.,  web  servers) 

generally ask for a user's username and password to 
prove 
to 
resources 

identity  before  authorizing  access 

b)  Encryption:  The  main  method  used  for  ensuring 
data security in the cloud is by encryption. It is used 
to ensure sensitive  or confidential data is kept safe 
and secure when transferred to external-based cloud 
service  providers.  It  provide  confidentiality  by 
hiding all useful information about the plaintext.

security  features  like  Intrusion  Prevention,  web 
content filtering, data loss prevention and we can an 
create  security  policies 
that  allow 
traffic  for 
particular services, ports, and addresses. 

B.  Compliance of The Cloud 

Cloud  compliance  concern  arises  as  soon  as  you 
make  use  of  cloud  storage  or  backup  services.  By 
moving  data  from  internal  storage  to  external  it  is 
necessary to examine closely how that data will be kept 
so  that  it  remain  compliant  with  laws  and  industry 
regulations. So, when  it comes to cloud compliance the 
concerns are what data should be move to the cloud and 
what  should  be  kept  in-house,  what  terms  should  be 
written into SLAs to maintain compliance? 

impact  on 

a)  Data Location: - The location of a data center 
can  have  a  significant 
the 
performance  of  applications  delivered  out  of  a 
cloud computing environment. After all, a poor 
choice in physical location can incur additional 
risk for enterprises trusting their applications to 
a  cloud  computing  provider.  If  a  cloud 
computing  provider's  primary  data  center  is  in 
the  country  where  which  is  in  risky  location, 
the  performance  of  that  application  will  be 
adversely affected by various problems.[3] 

b)  Service Level Agreements (SLAs):- it tend to be 
treated  as  boilerplate  documents  which  spell 
out  what  is  expected  from  your  cloud  service 
provider in terms of uptime or availability and 
support[5]. 

C.  Compatibility 
It is another issue that restrains large organizations 
from  embracing  cloud  technology.  When  existing  IT 
infrastructure  may  not  be  compatible  with  cloud 
technology  or  too  complex  to  restructure. The  problem 
arises when the company would have to replace much of 
its  existing  IT  infrastructures  in  order  to  make  the 
system compatible on the cloud [2]. 

a)  Application  Compatibility:-  it  is  especially 
important  when  you  are  considering  moving 
existing  code  to  a  cloud  platform as  a  service.  
You  should  assess  how  the  restrictions  will

Abstract—As we know that now a days the use of computing services is rapidly increasing over internet, so there is a 
need to buy mainframe system for every enterprise to full fill the requirements of end users and this can be overcome 
by  use  of  cloud  computing  services  in  a  inexpensive  manner.  Cloud  computing  paradigm  offers  a  wide  range  of 
computing services for enterprises in terms of elasticity, service dynamism and highly scalable technology. This paper 
focus  on  the  comparison  of  different  parameters  such  as  (platforms,  language,  integrated  database  etc.),  of  various 
cloud service providers. So it makes very easy for any enterprise to choose the best vendor  of cloud service provider 
according to their requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION  

In  today‟s  scenario  everyone  access  internet  through  the 
most  common  websites  like  Google,  Yahoo.  So  there  is  a 
need  of  some  kind  of  place  over  internet  through  which 
anyone  can  use  the  resources  dynamically  to  develop  and 
deploy applications. This need leads to the invention of cloud 
computing technology, i.e. next higher level in the evolution 
of  Internet.  It  is  a  different  style  of  computing  where 
dynamically  scalable  and  virtualized  resources  are  provided 
as  a  service  over  the  internet  [1].  The  cloud  is  a  collection 
data  center  hardware  and  software,  which  is  responsible  for 
providing services to the clients. In Cloud computing through 
clouds  various  services  is  offered  such  as  computing 
infrastructure, computing power, business processes, personal 
collaboration,  and  applications.  Clouds  are  categorized  into 
three types.  

1.  Public Cloud: - In this the resources are dynamically 
provisioned to the general public on a fine-grained, 
self-service basis over the Internet.  

2.  Private  Cloud:  -  It  is  infrastructure  managed  by 
for  a  single 

third-party  and  operated  solely 
organization.  

3.  Hybrid cloud:- These are combination of Public and 
Private  clouds,    and  offers  the  benefits  to  multiple  
users and clients. 

Cloud Computing moves around three scenarios. In first 
scenario      the  cloud  service  provider  offers  hardware, 
software,  integration,  enable  technology,  infrastructure  and 
application to its clients on demand basis. In Second scenario 
the  Partners  of  this  service  provider  create  different  cloud 
services that are directly accessible to clients and customers. 
In the Last scenario, the Business owner can use and evaluate 
various  types  of  cloud  services  offered  by  the  previous 
scenario. 

This  paper  aims  to  provide  a  better  understanding  of 
various  cloud  service  provider  by  comparing  different 
parameters, so that any business organization or individual is 

capable of choosing the best one according to their financial, 
technical, infrastructure, hardware/software need. 

the 

The rest  of  the  paper  is  organized as  follows.  Section  2 
describes 
types  of  cloud  services.  In  Section  3 
characteristics  of  cloud  computing  services  are  discussed. 
Section  4  explain  the  factor  of  evaluation  for  cloud 
computing services

Platform as a Service(PaaS) 

Platform as a  service:- In the  cloud  PaaS is   a  collection  
of  software  and  development  tools  hosted  on  the  provider's 
infrastructure. Developers build and deploy their applications 
on the  provider's platform.The  customer may  use  API‟s and 
software  installed  on  a  PaaS  provider.  The  aim  is  to  design 
and deploy the application in a quick and efficient manner. 

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 

It  is a  preliminary  point  for  anyone  looking  to receive  a 
IaaS cloud services. The IaaS market, has proven to be one of 
the  most  exciting  ones  in  the  cloud  space,  and  there  have 
been  several  important  factors,  such  as  changes  in  pricing

information,  Compatibility  operating 
strategies,  Pricing 
Systems  and languages,  supporting  services  and  many  other 
have  to  be  considered  in  order  to  choose  particular  service 
provider [2]. 
Software as a Service (SaaS)  

  This  is  where  cloud  service  providers  enable  their 
clients  to  get  access  of  infrastructure,  software‟s  etc.  From 
productivity  applications  and  CRM  app„s  suites  to  software 
programs which manage cloud applications and deployments 
and even enable the creation of hybrid clouds, software as a 
service  is  exceptionally  broad  and  runs  the  scope.  Here  we 
consider  cloud  software  and  application  providers  that  are 
performing  in  different  way,  something  new  or  something 
predominantly well [3].   

III. CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE 

There  are    many  different  cloud  computing  services 
present  ,but  they  all  are  characterize  according  to  type  of 
services  offered  .Now  we  examine  the    common  and 
specifice  characteristics  of  Iaas,  Paas,  and  SaaS  cloud 
services.  It  is  likely  that  the  list  can  be  expanded  further, 
however,  the  selected  characteristics  allow  more  clear 
distinctions at each level. 
Common characteristics 

The  shared  characteristics  are  the  license  type,  the 
intended user group, the security offered, formal agreements 
between  the  provider  and  the  customer.  In  the  following 
sections, each of these features will be discussed. 
 License type  

lack 

influence 

the  power  and 

A lot of cloud monitoring software is open-source based, 
as  well  as  smaller  cloud  computing  services,  since  small 
players  often 
to  push 
proprietary  software  on  the  market  [5].  License  types  also 
play  a  role  when  offering  infrastructure-  and  platform-level 
services. IaaS providers do not suffer from software licensing 
issues when renting out their virtual servers without operating 
systems 
including  operating 
systems  and  software  packages,  this  can  cause  potential 
problems as to how the customer should be billed when using 
the service for a limited time period. Often additional fees for 
the software use need to be paid 
 Intended user group 

installed.  However,  when 

Cloud computing services offered are varied according to 
the  users  (private,  public,  corporate).  Mainly  IaaS  and  PaaS 
offerings are intended for companies, whereas SaaS offerings 
exist for corporations, private individuals or both, such as the 
Google Apps [6]. However, this does not imply that services 
aimed  at  companies  cannot  be  purchased  by  individuals.  A 
further  distinction  can  be  made  between  mobile  and  fixed 
users.  Mobile  users  access  their  cloud  computing  services 
from  anywhere  such  as  office,  home  and  from  laptop  or 
desktop.  Fixed  users  are  static  and  always  use  the  same 
device  to  connect  to  the  service.  Once  cloud  computing 
services  intended  to  support  smart  phones  and  other  lower 
source  devices  are  available  an  additional  group,  based  on 
this hardware type, can be considered. 
Security and privacy  

Security and privacy are major aspects, because we know 
very usefull and important data resides on cloud‟s data server. 
Any  kind  of    data leakage and losses  cause  overall profit  of 

company  [7].  There  has  certain  rules  are  implemented  to 
ensure data protection from any loss. 
Formal Agreements 

Service level arguments (formal arguments) define which 

level of service, quality of  service  is given to client  
 [8].  The SLAs include technical specifications of measures, 
such as uptime or turn around time. Most SLAs also describe 
on failure what compensation provided to client. Due to the 
lack  of  standards  most  cloud  service  providers  use  SLA 
agreements  to  convince  potential  customers  to  use  clouds 
“even for mission-critical industrial services. 
IaaS -Specific Characteristics 

The  main  IaaS  specific  characteristics  are  the  available 
operating  system,  software  frameworks  and  applications. 
Mostly IaaS providers support  Open-Solaris , Linux systems, 
and  Windows  .Widely  supported  applications  include  the 
Apache  HTTP  Server  and  the  MySQL  database  software. 
Another  characteristic  that  is  important  for  developers  is 
whether  and  what  kind  of  development  tools  the  provider 
supplies. This could include an API or special command line 
tools [9]. Services comprising virtual instances can be further 
differentiated based on the virtualization technology used. 
PaaS-specific characteristics 

An  important  platform-level  characteristic  is  related  to 
which  programming 
languages  and  environments  are 
supported.  Google‟s  App  Engine,  for  example,  currently 
only supports Python and Java environments. The supported 
operating  systems  and  applications  can  also  be  a  relevant 
feature.[10] 
SaaS-specific characteristics 

Software cloud services vary a lot. A characteristic to be 
considered is the customer/application domain of the offered 
service.  This  domain  could  be  customer  relations  or  other 
business  management  areas,  office  applications,  social 
networking, and data exchange.

V. CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPARISON 

Below  table describe  the  comparative  analysis  of  four  cloud 
service providers with respective key  features.[12] 

CLOUD COMPUTING CONCERNS 

A.  Security 

There  are  significant  security  concerns  that  need  to  be 
addressed when considering moving critical applications and 
sensitive data to public and shared cloud environments. 

a)  Authentication:  An  authentication  for  a  cloud 
computing environment enables cloud customers to 
retain  control  over  their  enterprise  information 
when  their  applications  are  deployed  in  the  cloud. 
User  authentication  is  a  function  that  service 
providers  offer  to  ensure  that  users  accessing 
resources  (e.g.,  applications,  web  content,  etc.)  are 
authorized to do so. To ensure that a user is not an 
imposter,  service  providers  (e.g.,  web  servers) 

generally ask for a user's username and password to 
prove 
to 
resources 

identity  before  authorizing  access 

b)  Encryption:  The  main  method  used  for  ensuring 
data security in the cloud is by encryption. It is used 
to ensure sensitive  or confidential data is kept safe 
and secure when transferred to external-based cloud 
service  providers.  It  provide  confidentiality  by 
hiding all useful information about the plaintext.

security  features  like  Intrusion  Prevention,  web 
content filtering, data loss prevention and we can an 
create  security  policies 
that  allow 
traffic  for 
particular services, ports, and addresses. 

B.  Compliance of The Cloud 

Cloud  compliance  concern  arises  as  soon  as  you 
make  use  of  cloud  storage  or  backup  services.  By 
moving  data  from  internal  storage  to  external  it  is 
necessary to examine closely how that data will be kept 
so  that  it  remain  compliant  with  laws  and  industry 
regulations. So, when  it comes to cloud compliance the 
concerns are what data should be move to the cloud and 
what  should  be  kept  in-house,  what  terms  should  be 
written into SLAs to maintain compliance? 

impact  on 

a)  Data Location: - The location of a data center 
can  have  a  significant 
the 
performance  of  applications  delivered  out  of  a 
cloud computing environment. After all, a poor 
choice in physical location can incur additional 
risk for enterprises trusting their applications to 
a  cloud  computing  provider.  If  a  cloud 
computing  provider's  primary  data  center  is  in 
the  country  where  which  is  in  risky  location, 
the  performance  of  that  application  will  be 
adversely affected by various problems.[3] 

b)  Service Level Agreements (SLAs):- it tend to be 
treated  as  boilerplate  documents  which  spell 
out  what  is  expected  from  your  cloud  service 
provider in terms of uptime or availability and 
support[5]. 

C.  Compatibility 
It is another issue that restrains large organizations 
from  embracing  cloud  technology.  When  existing  IT 
infrastructure  may  not  be  compatible  with  cloud 
technology  or  too  complex  to  restructure. The  problem 
arises when the company would have to replace much of 
its  existing  IT  infrastructures  in  order  to  make  the 
system compatible on the cloud [2]. 

a)  Application  Compatibility:-  it  is  especially 
important  when  you  are  considering  moving 
existing  code  to  a  cloud  platform as  a  service.  
You  should  assess  how  the  restrictions  will

impact  your  code  and  estimate  the  cost  and 
time  required  to  modify  the  application.    For 
example,  if  your  application  currently  uses 
sockets  to  communicate  between  concurrent 
processes  you  might  be  able  to  use  messaging 
queues  instead.    This  kind  of  change  might 
actually 
reliability  of  your 
application  since  messaging  queues  guarantee 
items 
the  queue  are  eventually  made 
available  to  other  processes  which  may  not  be 
the case  when applications using basic socket-
based protocols crash.[1] 

improve 

the 

in 

b)  Language Support:- In cases where you are developing 
languages  and 

new  applications,  consider  what 

 

frameworks  are  supported.    Cloud  Bees  is  a  PaaS  for 
Java  developers,  PHP  Fog,  as  the  name  implies,  is 
geared  toward  PHP  shots,  while  DotCloud  allows 
customers  to  mix  and  match  databases,  message 
queues,  caches  and  programming  languages  of  their 
choice.    Amazon  Beanstalk  takes  a  slightly  different 
approach 
to  automate 
provisioning,  auto  scaling,  and 
load  balancing. 
Developers control the combination of features, such as 
machine  type  and  storage  type.  If  at  any  time 
developers want to dive down into the virtual machine 
details  they  have  the  same  options  as  those  who 
directly run VMs on Amazon EC2 hardware.[1]

Abstract—As we know that now a days the use of computing services is rapidly increasing over internet, so there is a 
need to buy mainframe system for every enterprise to full fill the requirements of end users and this can be overcome 
by  use  of  cloud  computing  services  in  a  inexpensive  manner.  Cloud  computing  paradigm  offers  a  wide  range  of 
computing services for enterprises in terms of elasticity, service dynamism and highly scalable technology. This paper 
focus  on  the  comparison  of  different  parameters  such  as  (platforms,  language,  integrated  database  etc.),  of  various 
cloud service providers. So it makes very easy for any enterprise to choose the best vendor  of cloud service provider 
according to their requirements.  

Keywords— cloud computing; comparison, SLA  

I. INTRODUCTION  

In  today‟s  scenario  everyone  access  internet  through  the 
most  common  websites  like  Google,  Yahoo.  So  there  is  a 
need  of  some  kind  of  place  over  internet  through  which 
anyone  can  use  the  resources  dynamically  to  develop  and 
deploy applications. This need leads to the invention of cloud 
computing technology, i.e. next higher level in the evolution 
of  Internet.  It  is  a  different  style  of  computing  where 
dynamically  scalable  and  virtualized  resources  are  provided 
as  a  service  over  the  internet  [1].  The  cloud  is  a  collection 
data  center  hardware  and  software,  which  is  responsible  for 
providing services to the clients. In Cloud computing through 
clouds  various  services  is  offered  such  as  computing 
infrastructure, computing power, business processes, personal 
collaboration,  and  applications.  Clouds  are  categorized  into 
three types.  

1.  Public Cloud: - In this the resources are dynamically 
provisioned to the general public on a fine-grained, 
self-service basis over the Internet.  

2.  Private  Cloud:  -  It  is  infrastructure  managed  by 
for  a  single 

third-party  and  operated  solely 
organization.  

3.  Hybrid cloud:- These are combination of Public and 
Private  clouds,    and  offers  the  benefits  to  multiple  
users and clients. 

Cloud Computing moves around three scenarios. In first 
scenario      the  cloud  service  provider  offers  hardware, 
software,  integration,  enable  technology,  infrastructure  and 
application to its clients on demand basis. In Second scenario 
the  Partners  of  this  service  provider  create  different  cloud 
services that are directly accessible to clients and customers. 
In the Last scenario, the Business owner can use and evaluate 
various  types  of  cloud  services  offered  by  the  previous 
scenario. 

This  paper  aims  to  provide  a  better  understanding  of 
various  cloud  service  provider  by  comparing  different 
parameters, so that any business organization or individual is 

capable of choosing the best one according to their financial, 
technical, infrastructure, hardware/software need. 

the 

The rest  of  the  paper  is  organized as  follows.  Section  2 
describes 
types  of  cloud  services.  In  Section  3 
characteristics  of  cloud  computing  services  are  discussed. 
Section  4  explain  the  factor  of  evaluation  for  cloud 
computing services 

II. TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES 

These services are broadly divided into three categories 

as shown in below figure.

Platform as a Service(PaaS) 

Platform as a  service:- In the  cloud  PaaS is   a  collection  
of  software  and  development  tools  hosted  on  the  provider's 
infrastructure. Developers build and deploy their applications 
on the  provider's platform.The  customer may  use  API‟s and 
software  installed  on  a  PaaS  provider.  The  aim  is  to  design 
and deploy the application in a quick and efficient manner. 

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 

It  is a  preliminary  point  for  anyone  looking  to receive  a 
IaaS cloud services. The IaaS market, has proven to be one of 
the  most  exciting  ones  in  the  cloud  space,  and  there  have 
been  several  important  factors,  such  as  changes  in  pricing

information,  Compatibility  operating 
strategies,  Pricing 
Systems  and languages,  supporting  services  and  many  other 
have  to  be  considered  in  order  to  choose  particular  service 
provider [2]. 
Software as a Service (SaaS)  

  This  is  where  cloud  service  providers  enable  their 
clients  to  get  access  of  infrastructure,  software‟s  etc.  From 
productivity  applications  and  CRM  app„s  suites  to  software 
programs which manage cloud applications and deployments 
and even enable the creation of hybrid clouds, software as a 
service  is  exceptionally  broad  and  runs  the  scope.  Here  we 
consider  cloud  software  and  application  providers  that  are 
performing  in  different  way,  something  new  or  something 
predominantly well [3].   

III. CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE 

There  are    many  different  cloud  computing  services 
present  ,but  they  all  are  characterize  according  to  type  of 
services  offered  .Now  we  examine  the    common  and 
specifice  characteristics  of  Iaas,  Paas,  and  SaaS  cloud 
services.  It  is  likely  that  the  list  can  be  expanded  further, 
however,  the  selected  characteristics  allow  more  clear 
distinctions at each level. 
Common characteristics 

The  shared  characteristics  are  the  license  type,  the 
intended user group, the security offered, formal agreements 
between  the  provider  and  the  customer.  In  the  following 
sections, each of these features will be discussed. 
 License type  

lack 

influence 

the  power  and 

A lot of cloud monitoring software is open-source based, 
as  well  as  smaller  cloud  computing  services,  since  small 
players  often 
to  push 
proprietary  software  on  the  market  [5].  License  types  also 
play  a  role  when  offering  infrastructure-  and  platform-level 
services. IaaS providers do not suffer from software licensing 
issues when renting out their virtual servers without operating 
systems 
including  operating 
systems  and  software  packages,  this  can  cause  potential 
problems as to how the customer should be billed when using 
the service for a limited time period. Often additional fees for 
the software use need to be paid 
 Intended user group 

installed.  However,  when 

Cloud computing services offered are varied according to 
the  users  (private,  public,  corporate).  Mainly  IaaS  and  PaaS 
offerings are intended for companies, whereas SaaS offerings 
exist for corporations, private individuals or both, such as the 
Google Apps [6]. However, this does not imply that services 
aimed  at  companies  cannot  be  purchased  by  individuals.  A 
further  distinction  can  be  made  between  mobile  and  fixed 
users.  Mobile  users  access  their  cloud  computing  services 
from  anywhere  such  as  office,  home  and  from  laptop  or 
desktop.  Fixed  users  are  static  and  always  use  the  same 
device  to  connect  to  the  service.  Once  cloud  computing 
services  intended  to  support  smart  phones  and  other  lower 
source  devices  are  available  an  additional  group,  based  on 
this hardware type, can be considered. 
Security and privacy  

Security and privacy are major aspects, because we know 
very usefull and important data resides on cloud‟s data server. 
Any  kind  of    data leakage and losses  cause  overall profit  of 

company  [7].  There  has  certain  rules  are  implemented  to 
ensure data protection from any loss. 
Formal Agreements 

Service level arguments (formal arguments) define which 

level of service, quality of  service  is given to client  
 [8].  The SLAs include technical specifications of measures, 
such as uptime or turn around time. Most SLAs also describe 
on failure what compensation provided to client. Due to the 
lack  of  standards  most  cloud  service  providers  use  SLA 
agreements  to  convince  potential  customers  to  use  clouds 
“even for mission-critical industrial services. 
IaaS -Specific Characteristics 

The  main  IaaS  specific  characteristics  are  the  available 
operating  system,  software  frameworks  and  applications. 
Mostly IaaS providers support  Open-Solaris , Linux systems, 
and  Windows  .Widely  supported  applications  include  the 
Apache  HTTP  Server  and  the  MySQL  database  software. 
Another  characteristic  that  is  important  for  developers  is 
whether  and  what  kind  of  development  tools  the  provider 
supplies. This could include an API or special command line 
tools [9]. Services comprising virtual instances can be further 
differentiated based on the virtualization technology used. 
PaaS-specific characteristics 

An  important  platform-level  characteristic  is  related  to 
which  programming 
languages  and  environments  are 
supported.  Google‟s  App  Engine,  for  example,  currently 
only supports Python and Java environments. The supported 
operating  systems  and  applications  can  also  be  a  relevant 
feature.[10] 
SaaS-specific characteristics 

Software cloud services vary a lot. A characteristic to be 
considered is the customer/application domain of the offered 
service.  This  domain  could  be  customer  relations  or  other 
business  management  areas,  office  applications,  social 
networking, and data exchange. 

IV. EVALUATION FACTOR OF CLOUD SERVICES

V. CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPARISON 

Below  table describe  the  comparative  analysis  of  four  cloud 
service providers with respective key  features.[12] 

CLOUD COMPUTING CONCERNS 

A.  Security 

There  are  significant  security  concerns  that  need  to  be 
addressed when considering moving critical applications and 
sensitive data to public and shared cloud environments. 

a)  Authentication:  An  authentication  for  a  cloud 
computing environment enables cloud customers to 
retain  control  over  their  enterprise  information 
when  their  applications  are  deployed  in  the  cloud. 
User  authentication  is  a  function  that  service 
providers  offer  to  ensure  that  users  accessing 
resources  (e.g.,  applications,  web  content,  etc.)  are 
authorized to do so. To ensure that a user is not an 
imposter,  service  providers  (e.g.,  web  servers) 

generally ask for a user's username and password to 
prove 
to 
resources 

identity  before  authorizing  access 

b)  Encryption:  The  main  method  used  for  ensuring 
data security in the cloud is by encryption. It is used 
to ensure sensitive  or confidential data is kept safe 
and secure when transferred to external-based cloud 
service  providers.  It  provide  confidentiality  by 
hiding all useful information about the plaintext.

prohibits  access  to  inappropriate  web  content, 
restricts  downloads  of  infected  files,  and  enables 
secure  use  of  your  network  through  a  secure 
managed  gateway. 
firewalls  Adds  additional 
security  features  like  Intrusion  Prevention,  web 
content filtering, data loss prevention and we can an 
create  security  policies 
that  allow 
traffic  for 
particular services, ports, and addresses. 

B.  Compliance of The Cloud 

Cloud  compliance  concern  arises  as  soon  as  you 
make  use  of  cloud  storage  or  backup  services.  By 
moving  data  from  internal  storage  to  external  it  is 
necessary to examine closely how that data will be kept 
so  that  it  remain  compliant  with  laws  and  industry 
regulations. So, when  it comes to cloud compliance the 
concerns are what data should be move to the cloud and 
what  should  be  kept  in-house,  what  terms  should  be 
written into SLAs to maintain compliance? 

impact  on 

a)  Data Location: - The location of a data center 
can  have  a  significant 
the 
performance  of  applications  delivered  out  of  a 
cloud computing environment. After all, a poor 
choice in physical location can incur additional 
risk for enterprises trusting their applications to 
a  cloud  computing  provider.  If  a  cloud 
computing  provider's  primary  data  center  is  in 
the  country  where  which  is  in  risky  location, 
the  performance  of  that  application  will  be 
adversely affected by various problems.[3] 

b)  Service Level Agreements (SLAs):- it tend to be 
treated  as  boilerplate  documents  which  spell 
out  what  is  expected  from  your  cloud  service 
provider in terms of uptime or availability and 
support[5]. 

C.  Compatibility 
It is another issue that restrains large organizations 
from  embracing  cloud  technology.  When  existing  IT 
infrastructure  may  not  be  compatible  with  cloud 
technology  or  too  complex  to  restructure. The  problem 
arises when the company would have to replace much of 
its  existing  IT  infrastructures  in  order  to  make  the 
system compatible on the cloud [2]. 

a)  Application  Compatibility:-  it  is  especially 
important  when  you  are  considering  moving 
existing  code  to  a  cloud  platform as  a  service.  
You  should  assess  how  the  restrictions  will

impact  your  code  and  estimate  the  cost  and 
time  required  to  modify  the  application.    For 
example,  if  your  application  currently  uses 
sockets  to  communicate  between  concurrent 
processes  you  might  be  able  to  use  messaging 
queues  instead.    This  kind  of  change  might 
actually 
reliability  of  your 
application  since  messaging  queues  guarantee 
items 
the  queue  are  eventually  made 
available  to  other  processes  which  may  not  be 
the case  when applications using basic socket-
based protocols crash.[1] 

improve 

the 

in 

b)  Language Support:- In cases where you are developing 
languages  and 

new  applications,  consider  what 

 

frameworks  are  supported.    Cloud  Bees  is  a  PaaS  for 
Java  developers,  PHP  Fog,  as  the  name  implies,  is 
geared  toward  PHP  shots,  while  DotCloud  allows 
customers  to  mix  and  match  databases,  message 
queues,  caches  and  programming  languages  of  their 
choice.    Amazon  Beanstalk  takes  a  slightly  different 
approach 
to  automate 
provisioning,  auto  scaling,  and 
load  balancing. 
Developers control the combination of features, such as 
machine  type  and  storage  type.  If  at  any  time 
developers want to dive down into the virtual machine 
details  they  have  the  same  options  as  those  who 
directly run VMs on Amazon EC2 hardware.[1]
