I INTRODUCTION 

 
Cloud Computing [1] is evolving as a paradigm for hosting Internet-scale applications in huge computing infrastructures. In 
particular, IT services are migrating from enterprise-scale computing infrastructures to cloud computing infrastructures that is 
pay-for-service huge data-centers with thousands of machines. Cloud computing refers to those services and applications that 
will be delivered in the internet cloud, and the main fact is that, in many cases, the devices that are used to access such services 
and applications which do not require any special applications.  
 

II CHARACTERISTICS 

 
Cloud computing [2] contains the following characteristics:- 
 
•  Shared  Infrastructure  —  Cloud  computing  uses  a  virtualized  software  model  that  enables  sharing  of  physical  devices, 
services, networking and storage capabilities.  
 
• Network Access — Cloud computing can be accessed over the internet from a broad scale of devices such as laptops, PCs and 
mobile devices, using some standards APIs.  
 
• Managed Metering — Cloud computing uses metering for managing and optimizing the services and to provide billing and 
reporting information. Consumers  are  also  billed for thus services in fulfillment of how  much they have actually used  such 
services during the billing period.

I INTRODUCTION 

 
Cloud Computing [1] is evolving as a paradigm for hosting Internet-scale applications in huge computing infrastructures. In 
particular, IT services are migrating from enterprise-scale computing infrastructures to cloud computing infrastructures that is 
pay-for-service huge data-centers with thousands of machines. Cloud computing refers to those services and applications that 
will be delivered in the internet cloud, and the main fact is that, in many cases, the devices that are used to access such services 
and applications which do not require any special applications.  
 

II CHARACTERISTICS 

 
Cloud computing [2] contains the following characteristics:- 
 
•  Shared  Infrastructure  —  Cloud  computing  uses  a  virtualized  software  model  that  enables  sharing  of  physical  devices, 
services, networking and storage capabilities.  
 
• Network Access — Cloud computing can be accessed over the internet from a broad scale of devices such as laptops, PCs and 
mobile devices, using some standards APIs.  
 
• Managed Metering — Cloud computing uses metering for managing and optimizing the services and to provide billing and 
reporting information. Consumers  are  also  billed for thus services in fulfillment of how  much they have actually used  such 
services during the billing period.

• Dynamic Provisioning  —  It  allows  for the  provision  of services that is  based  on recent demand requirements.  It is done 
automatically while using software automation that enables the expansion and contraction of service capability, as it is required. 
This dynamic scaling is required to be done while maintaining high levels of security and reliability. 
 
Cloud computing also allows you to share and scalable deployment of services, as it when required, from any position, and for 
this customer can be billed also that is based on usage which is actually done by the consumer. 
 

III SERVICE MODELS 

 
Once  a  cloud  is  established  [3],  Services  of  cloud computing  are  deployed  on  the  basis  of  business  models  that  can  differ 
depending on requirements. The service models being deployed are commonly known as(figure 1): 
 
1). Software as a Service (SaaS) — Application runs on the Cloud, doing away with client-side installations; instead access is 
via various thin client interfaces such as a web browser from a variety of devices  
 
2). Platform as a Service (PaaS) — Enables the development and deployment of applications without the cost and complexity 
of purchasing and managing the underlying hardware and software stack  
 
3). Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) — The Cloud infrastructure is used to deliver a virtualization platform. Examples  of 
IaaS are Amazon EC2 and S3, Windows Live Skydrive etc. 
 

Figure 1: Service Model Types 

 

IV DEPLOYMENT MODELS 

 
Deploying cloud computing[4] models can differ depending on the requirements. So, the deploying models are as follows: 
 
• Private Cloud — The cloud infrastructure is designed, deployed, maintained and operated for a specific organization. It has 
full control on hardware and software environment  
 
• Community Cloud — The cloud infrastructure is used and managed by participating organizations with similar interests and 
requirements. E.g. are Healthcare, Education etc. 
 
•  Public  Cloud  —  The  cloud  model  is  used  by  the  service provider  and  is  available  on  a  commercial  basis  to  the  public. 
Computing infrastructure is designed, hosted, maintained and operated by a cloud service provider that is available on a shared 
basis to number of subscribers over the Internet. 
 
•  Hybrid  Cloud  —  The  cloud  infrastructure  contains  number  of  clouds  of  any  type,  but  has  an  ability  to  extend  the 
infrastructure to the Public Cloud when it is required.

V Communications in the Cloud 

 
Making services [5] by service developers are available in the cloud that depends on the type of service that are being used to 
access it. The process is very simple as user clicks on the desired web page, or may also involve an application of API i.e. 
accessing the different services of the cloud. Telcos are starting point to use clouds to release their own services. 
 
Using the Communications Services 
In  the  cloud  system,  communications  services  can  extend  their  capabilities  and  provide  new  interactivity  capabilities  to  the 
current  services.  Cloud-based  services  enable  business  enterprises  to  embed  communications  capabilities  into  business 
applications such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. For “on 
the move” business people can accessed through a smartphone, is supporting to increased productivity while away from  the 
office.  
 
In terms of social networking, cloud computing provides click-to-call capabilities from social networking sites, and also access 
to video communications and Instant Messaging systems that can connect the peoples within the social circle. 
 
Accessing through Web APIs 
Accessing communications [6] capabilities is achieved through APIs in a cloud that is Web 2.0 APIs which allows application 
development to get advantage of the communication infrastructure within it outside the cloud (see Figure 3). 

Figure 3: Web 2.0 Interfaces to the Cloud 

 

These APIs provides a wide range of communications capabilities for cloud-based services that are limited by the media and 
signaling capabilities within the cloud. Today’s services of the media are allowed for communications and management of voice 
and video over a complex range of codecs. APIs also enable communication of other services that provides latest opportunities 
and helping to drive Average Revenue per User (ARPU) and attachment rates, especially for Telcos.

VI WEB APPLICATION AND CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
The  services  of  cloud  are  accessible  [7]  all  over  the  world  is  used  as  a  single  point  of  access  for  all  computing  needs  of 
consumers.  Some  recent  advances  in  processors,  disk  storage,  broadband  internet  access,  virtualization  technology  and 
inexpensive,  fast  servers  all  have  combined  to  make  cloud  computing  as  a  compelling  paradigm.  Cloud  computing  allows 
companies and users to pay and use the software and  storage that they  need. This type of software deployment is referred to as 
Software as a Service (SaaS).  
 
The components excluding human resources are 
  

infrastructure resources  

i) 
ii)  software resources, 
iii)  business processes 
iv)  application resources and 

 
The components in the cloud computing paradigm are dealed as services and  are in the “cloud. Infrastructure resources are 
treated as storage, computing power etc. can take the advantage of already existing technologies like grid computing[8]. In the 
software resources include application servers, IDE, database servers etc.. The business process resources can also be defined as 
a set of common business utilities which are given as services to the clients. Example are ERP software like SAP and Oracle 
providing some standard business workflows in the cloud. Some of the major companies that provides cloud services in cloud 
computing are Google, IBM,  Amazon, Microsoft, SalesForce etc. Current cloud computing services are spam filtering, storage 
services,  performing  applications  in  high  level  programming  languages  such  as  Java  or  the  use  of  some  kind  of  database. 
Google has released Google App Engine in 2008, which is a cloud-based  platform that is used for running applications for both  
individuals as well as businesses. Microsoft has also released Windows Azure which is known as a cloud-based system for the 
Community technology Preview. 
 

 

VII ISSUES & ADVANTAGES RELATED TO CLOUD COMPUTING FOR WEB APPLICATION 

 
Price:  It  is  ease  to  start-up  enterprise  companies  that  do  not  have  to  invest  huge  amount  of  money  into  setting  up  the 
infrastructure such  as  data  servers,  database  administrators,  application  servers,  people  resources  for  managing  such  critical 
systems including backup and recovery, etc.  
 
Simplicity: Cloud computing applications are easy to use and can also set up all the services without having to worry about 
resource management. 
 
Reliability: Data and Network access  are  guaranteed to be reliably  maintained over the service  provides that are experts in 
maintaining the infrastructure and such reliability is backed by some kind of  “money  back guarantees”  or penalties for the 
providers in the event if they have a down time. 
 
Flexibility: Consumers may have the flexibility to “outsource” parts of the infrastructure and can still maintained to some of the 
extent proprietary data at their own site. 
 
Collaboration: All the applications on the cloud become a natural fit for consumers to collaborate effectively on a common 
project or application. There are number of issues that are related to cloud computing and some of them are presented here. 
 
Privacy and Security 
Services of cloud computing allows users to add services, capacities and software patches, some organizations will be hesitant 
to put their data on a public-access cloud.  
 
According to security and privacy point of view, the more restricted to access to the data that is easier  to protect it. In order to 
ensure that the fast access to data stored and to prevent the loss of data in case of failure of one data center, the users data may 
be mirrored on two or more sites, making it even more vulnerable. On the other side, grouping such a massive amount of data in 
one  physical location  makes it prone to damage.  To  prevent large-scale  failures, the data should be stored  on sites that are 
geographically far apart.

Cloud Computing [1] is evolving as a paradigm for hosting Internet-scale applications in huge computing infrastructures. In 
particular, IT services are migrating from enterprise-scale computing infrastructures to cloud computing infrastructures that is 
pay-for-service huge data-centers with thousands of machines. Cloud computing refers to those services and applications that 
will be delivered in the internet cloud, and the main fact is that, in many cases, the devices that are used to access such services 
and applications which do not require any special applications.  
 

II CHARACTERISTICS 

 
Cloud computing [2] contains the following characteristics:- 
 
•  Shared  Infrastructure  —  Cloud  computing  uses  a  virtualized  software  model  that  enables  sharing  of  physical  devices, 
services, networking and storage capabilities.  
 
• Network Access — Cloud computing can be accessed over the internet from a broad scale of devices such as laptops, PCs and 
mobile devices, using some standards APIs.  
 
• Managed Metering — Cloud computing uses metering for managing and optimizing the services and to provide billing and 
reporting information. Consumers  are  also  billed for thus services in fulfillment of how  much they have actually used  such 
services during the billing period.

• Dynamic Provisioning  —  It  allows  for the  provision  of services that is  based  on recent demand requirements.  It is done 
automatically while using software automation that enables the expansion and contraction of service capability, as it is required. 
This dynamic scaling is required to be done while maintaining high levels of security and reliability. 
 
Cloud computing also allows you to share and scalable deployment of services, as it when required, from any position, and for 
this customer can be billed also that is based on usage which is actually done by the consumer. 
 

III SERVICE MODELS 

 
Once  a  cloud  is  established  [3],  Services  of  cloud computing  are  deployed  on  the  basis  of  business  models  that  can  differ 
depending on requirements. The service models being deployed are commonly known as(figure 1): 
 
1). Software as a Service (SaaS) — Application runs on the Cloud, doing away with client-side installations; instead access is 
via various thin client interfaces such as a web browser from a variety of devices  
 
2). Platform as a Service (PaaS) — Enables the development and deployment of applications without the cost and complexity 
of purchasing and managing the underlying hardware and software stack  
 
3). Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) — The Cloud infrastructure is used to deliver a virtualization platform. Examples  of 
IaaS are Amazon EC2 and S3, Windows Live Skydrive etc.

IV DEPLOYMENT MODELS 

 
Deploying cloud computing[4] models can differ depending on the requirements. So, the deploying models are as follows: 
 
• Private Cloud — The cloud infrastructure is designed, deployed, maintained and operated for a specific organization. It has 
full control on hardware and software environment  
 
• Community Cloud — The cloud infrastructure is used and managed by participating organizations with similar interests and 
requirements. E.g. are Healthcare, Education etc. 
 
•  Public  Cloud  —  The  cloud  model  is  used  by  the  service provider  and  is  available  on  a  commercial  basis  to  the  public. 
Computing infrastructure is designed, hosted, maintained and operated by a cloud service provider that is available on a shared 
basis to number of subscribers over the Internet. 
 
•  Hybrid  Cloud  —  The  cloud  infrastructure  contains  number  of  clouds  of  any  type,  but  has  an  ability  to  extend  the 
infrastructure to the Public Cloud when it is required.

V Communications in the Cloud 

 
Making services [5] by service developers are available in the cloud that depends on the type of service that are being used to 
access it. The process is very simple as user clicks on the desired web page, or may also involve an application of API i.e. 
accessing the different services of the cloud. Telcos are starting point to use clouds to release their own services. 
 
Using the Communications Services 
In  the  cloud  system,  communications  services  can  extend  their  capabilities  and  provide  new  interactivity  capabilities  to  the 
current  services.  Cloud-based  services  enable  business  enterprises  to  embed  communications  capabilities  into  business 
applications such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. For “on 
the move” business people can accessed through a smartphone, is supporting to increased productivity while away from  the 
office.  
 
In terms of social networking, cloud computing provides click-to-call capabilities from social networking sites, and also access 
to video communications and Instant Messaging systems that can connect the peoples within the social circle. 
 
Accessing through Web APIs 
Accessing communications [6] capabilities is achieved through APIs in a cloud that is Web 2.0 APIs which allows application 
development to get advantage of the communication infrastructure within it outside the cloud (see Figure 3). 

Figure 3: Web 2.0 Interfaces to the Cloud 

 

These APIs provides a wide range of communications capabilities for cloud-based services that are limited by the media and 
signaling capabilities within the cloud. Today’s services of the media are allowed for communications and management of voice 
and video over a complex range of codecs. APIs also enable communication of other services that provides latest opportunities 
and helping to drive Average Revenue per User (ARPU) and attachment rates, especially for Telcos.

VI WEB APPLICATION AND CLOUD COMPUTING 

 
The  services  of  cloud  are  accessible  [7]  all  over  the  world  is  used  as  a  single  point  of  access  for  all  computing  needs  of 
consumers.  Some  recent  advances  in  processors,  disk  storage,  broadband  internet  access,  virtualization  technology  and 
inexpensive,  fast  servers  all  have  combined  to  make  cloud  computing  as  a  compelling  paradigm.  Cloud  computing  allows 
companies and users to pay and use the software and  storage that they  need. This type of software deployment is referred to as 
Software as a Service (SaaS).  
 
The components excluding human resources are 
  

infrastructure resources  

i) 
ii)  software resources, 
iii)  business processes 
iv)  application resources and 

 
The components in the cloud computing paradigm are dealed as services and  are in the “cloud. Infrastructure resources are 
treated as storage, computing power etc. can take the advantage of already existing technologies like grid computing[8]. In the 
software resources include application servers, IDE, database servers etc.. The business process resources can also be defined as 
a set of common business utilities which are given as services to the clients. Example are ERP software like SAP and Oracle 
providing some standard business workflows in the cloud. Some of the major companies that provides cloud services in cloud 
computing are Google, IBM,  Amazon, Microsoft, SalesForce etc. Current cloud computing services are spam filtering, storage 
services,  performing  applications  in  high  level  programming  languages  such  as  Java  or  the  use  of  some  kind  of  database. 
Google has released Google App Engine in 2008, which is a cloud-based  platform that is used for running applications for both  
individuals as well as businesses. Microsoft has also released Windows Azure which is known as a cloud-based system for the 
Community technology Preview. 
 

 

VII ISSUES & ADVANTAGES RELATED TO CLOUD COMPUTING FOR WEB APPLICATION 

 
Price:  It  is  ease  to  start-up  enterprise  companies  that  do  not  have  to  invest  huge  amount  of  money  into  setting  up  the 
infrastructure such  as  data  servers,  database  administrators,  application  servers,  people  resources  for  managing  such  critical 
systems including backup and recovery, etc.  
 
Simplicity: Cloud computing applications are easy to use and can also set up all the services without having to worry about 
resource management. 
 
Reliability: Data and Network access  are  guaranteed to be reliably  maintained over the service  provides that are experts in 
maintaining the infrastructure and such reliability is backed by some kind of  “money  back guarantees”  or penalties for the 
providers in the event if they have a down time. 
 
Flexibility: Consumers may have the flexibility to “outsource” parts of the infrastructure and can still maintained to some of the 
extent proprietary data at their own site. 
 
Collaboration: All the applications on the cloud become a natural fit for consumers to collaborate effectively on a common 
project or application. There are number of issues that are related to cloud computing and some of them are presented here. 
 
Privacy and Security 
Services of cloud computing allows users to add services, capacities and software patches, some organizations will be hesitant 
to put their data on a public-access cloud.  
 
According to security and privacy point of view, the more restricted to access to the data that is easier  to protect it. In order to 
ensure that the fast access to data stored and to prevent the loss of data in case of failure of one data center, the users data may 
be mirrored on two or more sites, making it even more vulnerable. On the other side, grouping such a massive amount of data in 
one  physical location  makes it prone to damage.  To  prevent large-scale  failures, the data should be stored  on sites that are 
geographically far apart.

VIII CONCLUSION 

 

Cloud  computing  is  gaining  popularity  as  an  inexpensive  way  of  providing  software  and  storage.  A  newly  paradigm  of 
computing has started to evolve is referred to as cloud computing. As wireless broadband connection options grow, the cloud 
computing  allows  users  and  companies  to  pay  to  and  use the  software  and  storage  as  it  when  required.  A  cloud  can  be  a 
collection of computers that are located on the server side. Technologies like grid computing, peer-to-peer computing have a 
direct contribution to cloud computing. We have also given an importance to the connection between cloud computing as well 
as the web applications. We have also listed and highlighted various challenges and issues with cloud computing.  As Web 2.0 
and cloud services are also gaining popularity, the computing paradigm is shifting from large monolithic applications to thick 
clients, solution-stack based servers, and cloud-based computation and storage services. Many companies are moving towards 
with  the  intention  if  building  it  is  easy  to  use  clouds.  There  is  a  tremendous  potential  for  consumers  to  exploit  the  cloud 
computing technology. This paper contains an introduction to the technology and also discussed the various advantages as well 
as the challenges associated with it.
