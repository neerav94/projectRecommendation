subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net

is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

  {| |

    {

|     ̅|

 

    
 

(     )}                                             ( ) 

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

    {

|     ̅|

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

𝑚

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚

𝑚
∑   𝑗   (    𝜃𝑗)
   

                                      ( ) 

 

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

𝑚

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean 

80

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

  {| |

    {

|     ̅|

 

    
 

(     )}                                             ( ) 

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

𝑚

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  ) 

(2) reliability D:   

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑   (   )                                                        

(  ) 

(3) availability U:  

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( ) 

     ̅

So the rejection region of test is 

  {| |     
 

(     )}                                                     ( ) 

    {

|     ̅|

 

    
 

(     )}                                             ( ) 

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

𝑚

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  )

    ∑ ∑   (   )                                                        

(  ) 

(3) availability U:  

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of 
the  service  are  decided  in  advance.  Accordingly,  for  each  service    𝑗  in  sequence 
 
composition, its ∑
   

 is an established utility value. Therefore, given

In  conclusion,  after  normalization,  the  global  constraint  optimization  model  of  service 

   

composition is as follows:

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

    {

|     ̅|

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

𝑚

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  )

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of 
the  service  are  decided  in  advance.  Accordingly,  for  each  service    𝑗  in  sequence 
 
composition, its ∑
   

 is an established utility value. Therefore, given

In  conclusion,  after  normalization,  the  global  constraint  optimization  model  of  service

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

We compare the experiments of the proposed algorithm (PRC) with other  two algorithms 
(the distance method (DIS) [15]} and the difference method (DIF) [16]). The result of each

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

    {

|     ̅|

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean 

80

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  )

(  )

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of 
the  service  are  decided  in  advance.  Accordingly,  for  each  service    𝑗  in  sequence 
 
composition, its ∑
   

 is an established utility value. Therefore, given

In  conclusion,  after  normalization,  the  global  constraint  optimization  model  of  service

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

6.2. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

In  this  part  of  experiment,  2000  evaluations  of  users  are  simulated.  Where,  500  users  is

We compare the experiments of the proposed algorithm (PRC) with other  two algorithms 
(the distance method (DIS) [15]} and the difference method (DIF) [16]). The result of each 
experiment is expressed by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of user evaluations. The formula of 
MAE is defined as follows:

In  Figure  3,  we  can  see  that  the  MAE  of  proposed  algorithm  (PRC)  is  lower  and  more 
stable  than  other  two  methods  (DIS  and  DIF).  Fig.4  shows  the  comprehensive  evaluation 
(CER) of providers and clients based trust. Given the ideal evaluation of each service is 0.5, 
N=100. The initial evaluations of clients are all supposed to be higher than real values. From 
the graph, along with the lower rate ( ) of false, the comprehensive evaluations are closer to 
the ideal 0.5. 
 
6.3. Comparing Optimal Degree and Deviation of Service Composition 

Two  data  sets  are  employed  in  this  part  of  experiment.  One  set  is  QWS  real  data 
[17.18,19], the other set is simualted data set. The optimal degree of service composition is 
defined as follows: 

    

       
     

  

Where,         is  object  value  of  global  optimization,       is  object  value  of  local  pure 
optimization.  In  Figure  5,  we  compare  the  result  of  proposed  global  dynamic  optimal 
composition(GCP)  with  the  local  pure  optimal  method(LPP).  Where,  GPC(3)  represents 
optimal degree of composition with 3 constraints (execution time, reliability and availability), 
and  GCD(5)  represents  optimal  degree  of  composition  with  5  constraints  (execution  time, 
reliability,availability,  throughout  and  comprehensive  evaluation).  Obviously,  GCP(3)  is 
higher than GCP(5), because the more constraints are, the stricter service selection is. This is 
also a good illustration that our dynamic optimization algorithm is quite effective.

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

    {

|     ̅|

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean 

80

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  )

(  ) 

(3) availability U:  

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

6.2. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

In  this  part  of  experiment,  2000  evaluations  of  users  are  simulated.  Where,  500  users  is 
credible and other users are incredible. The evaluations of providers is from 100 Web service.  
We compare the experiments of the proposed algorithm (PRC) with other  two algorithms 
(the distance method (DIS) [15]} and the difference method (DIF) [16]). The result of each 
experiment is expressed by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of user evaluations. The formula of 
MAE is defined as follows:

In  Figure  3,  we  can  see  that  the  MAE  of  proposed  algorithm  (PRC)  is  lower  and  more 
stable  than  other  two  methods  (DIS  and  DIF).  Fig.4  shows  the  comprehensive  evaluation 
(CER) of providers and clients based trust. Given the ideal evaluation of each service is 0.5, 
N=100. The initial evaluations of clients are all supposed to be higher than real values. From 
the graph, along with the lower rate ( ) of false, the comprehensive evaluations are closer to 
the ideal 0.5. 
 
6.3. Comparing Optimal Degree and Deviation of Service Composition 

Two  data  sets  are  employed  in  this  part  of  experiment.  One  set  is  QWS  real  data 
[17.18,19], the other set is simualted data set. The optimal degree of service composition is 
defined as follows: 

    

       
     

  

Where,         is  object  value  of  global  optimization,       is  object  value  of  local  pure 
optimization.  In  Figure  5,  we  compare  the  result  of  proposed  global  dynamic  optimal 
composition(GCP)  with  the  local  pure  optimal  method(LPP).  Where,  GPC(3)  represents 
optimal degree of composition with 3 constraints (execution time, reliability and availability), 
and  GCD(5)  represents  optimal  degree  of  composition  with  5  constraints  (execution  time, 
reliability,availability,  throughout  and  comprehensive  evaluation).  Obviously,  GCP(3)  is 
higher than GCP(5), because the more constraints are, the stricter service selection is. This is 
also a good illustration that our dynamic optimization algorithm is quite effective.

of optimal degree in two composition patterns. GCPD represents the result of our method and

UTED represents  the result  without t-test  and  evaluation  model.  It  is  obviously  that  GCP is 
lower than UTED, and our method is proved to have a higher accuracy.As the QoS false rate 
increasing,  both  the  deviation  rates  of  GCPD  and  UTED  have  increasing  trends. 
However, the rise in UTED is significantly larger and quicker than GCPD. This proves 
GCPD  algorithm  has  better  stability.  Our  approach  of  GCPD  is  more  close  to  the 
optimal  goal.  This  because  GCPD  QoS  data  are  more  centralized  and  precise  after 
filtered  by  t-test  and  revised  by  the  trust  evaluation  model,  while  the  UTED  QoS  data 
contains obvious outliers and false values, which result in the inaccuracy of data.  
 
7. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposed  a  global  dynamic  service  composition  based  on  objective  QoS 
randomness and subjective trust evaluation in cloud computing environment. In contrast with 
previous  studies,  we  designed  a  more  comprehensive  multi-criteria  assessment  for  service 
quality,  considering  dynamic  influences  of  unstable  network  factors,  providers  and  clients. 
After  rejecting  QoS  outliers  values  and  revising  false  evaluations,  the  services  are  globally 
optimized  and  composed  with  objective  and  subjective  QoS  constraints.  The  experimented 
results proved that the algorithm is suitable for dynamically changing cloud environment and 
is able to guarantee the true quality of service composition.

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

𝑚
∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean

evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑

   𝑗 𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  ) 

(2) reliability D:

(  ) 

(3) availability U:  

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of 
the  service  are  decided  in  advance.  Accordingly,  for  each  service    𝑗  in  sequence 
 
composition, its ∑

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

6.2. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

In  this  part  of  experiment,  2000  evaluations  of  users  are  simulated.  Where,  500  users  is 
credible and other users are incredible. The evaluations of providers is from 100 Web service.  
We compare the experiments of the proposed algorithm (PRC) with other  two algorithms 
(the distance method (DIS) [15]} and the difference method (DIF) [16]). The result of each 
experiment is expressed by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of user evaluations. The formula of 
MAE is defined as follows:

In  Figure  3,  we  can  see  that  the  MAE  of  proposed  algorithm  (PRC)  is  lower  and  more 
stable  than  other  two  methods  (DIS  and  DIF).  Fig.4  shows  the  comprehensive  evaluation 
(CER) of providers and clients based trust. Given the ideal evaluation of each service is 0.5, 
N=100. The initial evaluations of clients are all supposed to be higher than real values. From 
the graph, along with the lower rate ( ) of false, the comprehensive evaluations are closer to 
the ideal 0.5. 
 
6.3. Comparing Optimal Degree and Deviation of Service Composition 

Two  data  sets  are  employed  in  this  part  of  experiment.  One  set  is  QWS  real  data 
[17.18,19], the other set is simualted data set. The optimal degree of service composition is 
defined as follows: 

    

       
     

  

Where,         is  object  value  of  global  optimization,       is  object  value  of  local  pure 
optimization.  In  Figure  5,  we  compare  the  result  of  proposed  global  dynamic  optimal 
composition(GCP)  with  the  local  pure  optimal  method(LPP).  Where,  GPC(3)  represents 
optimal degree of composition with 3 constraints (execution time, reliability and availability), 
and  GCD(5)  represents  optimal  degree  of  composition  with  5  constraints  (execution  time, 
reliability,availability,  throughout  and  comprehensive  evaluation).  Obviously,  GCP(3)  is 
higher than GCP(5), because the more constraints are, the stricter service selection is. This is 
also a good illustration that our dynamic optimization algorithm is quite effective.

The deviation rate of optimal degree is defined as follows:

Where,        is  the  optimal  value  of  global  dynamic  composition,  and       is  the  real 
QoS aggregation value of service composition. Fig.6 shows the changes of the deviation rate 
of optimal degree in two composition patterns. GCPD represents the result of our method and

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing

UTED represents  the result  without t-test  and  evaluation  model.  It  is  obviously  that  GCP is 
lower than UTED, and our method is proved to have a higher accuracy.As the QoS false rate 
increasing,  both  the  deviation  rates  of  GCPD  and  UTED  have  increasing  trends. 
However, the rise in UTED is significantly larger and quicker than GCPD. This proves 
GCPD  algorithm  has  better  stability.  Our  approach  of  GCPD  is  more  close  to  the 
optimal  goal.  This  because  GCPD  QoS  data  are  more  centralized  and  precise  after 
filtered  by  t-test  and  revised  by  the  trust  evaluation  model,  while  the  UTED  QoS  data 
contains obvious outliers and false values, which result in the inaccuracy of data.  
 
7. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposed  a  global  dynamic  service  composition  based  on  objective  QoS 
randomness and subjective trust evaluation in cloud computing environment. In contrast with 
previous  studies,  we  designed  a  more  comprehensive  multi-criteria  assessment  for  service 
quality,  considering  dynamic  influences  of  unstable  network  factors,  providers  and  clients. 
After  rejecting  QoS  outliers  values  and  revising  false  evaluations,  the  services  are  globally 
optimized  and  composed  with  objective  and  subjective  QoS  constraints.  The  experimented 
results proved that the algorithm is suitable for dynamically changing cloud environment and 
is able to guarantee the true quality of service composition.

Abstract 

In an open and dynamic cloud computing environment, the randomness of cloud services 
with  unreliable  quality  leads  to  low  accuracy  in  service  composition.  To  address  the  above 
problem, this paper proposes a global trust service composition approach based on random 
QoS and trust evaluation, considering the multi-criteria assessment of service quality. Firstly, 
statistical test is employed to remove the uncertain outliers and to estimate the ideal value of 
the collected objective QoS data. Secondly, subjective QoS evaluations of providers and 
users  are  aggregated  according  to  direct  trust  and  recommended  trust.  Finally, 
services  are  composed  through  global  QoS  optimization.  Experiments  for  each  stage  show 
that the approach improves the accuracy and precision of service composition.

1. Introduction 

Cloud computing is an internet-based service mode to achieve various IT capabilities and 
flexible invocations. Configurable resources are provided to computers and other devices as 
services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). The traditional service computing is evolved towards a 
more flexible, dynamic, scalable and business-oriented cloud computing environment. There 
are more and more popular cloud applications which are composed by software components 
and  cloud  services  (such  as  Web  service).  As  single  service  cannot  satisfy  ever-changing 
functional  requirements  of  user-sides,  many  enterprises  aim  at  combining  multiple  services 
into a more powerful new service in the cloud. Moreover, high quality of service (QoS) must 
be  crucially  considered  in  service  selection  and  composition,  since  there  are  a  number  of 
functionally  equivalent  services.  However,  in  the  open  and  variable  cloud  environment,  the 
unstable situation such as dynamic network topology, transmission channel interference and 
node  performance  changing  makes  QoS  to  present  dynamic  and  random  values.  Hence,  the 
authenticity of service quality is badly influenced. Some abnormal emergency of system, or 
false malicious evaluation beyond the normal levels of QoS also results in the false attributes 
of  service  quality.  Therefore,  the  dynamic  quality  of  cloud  services  supplied  by  more  and 
more  public,  private  and  hybrid  cloud,  along  with  ways  to  build  credible  and  accurate 
combination of services become an important research problem.

In this study, we present a dynamic trust service composition algorithm with multi-criteria 
assessments  of  QoS.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  objective  and 
subjective  QoS  attributes,  so  that  the  needs  of  customers,  providers  and  third-party  net 
environment can be better satisfied. We considered two types of attributes of QoS. One type 
is objective QoS (such as execution time, reliability, availability, throughout) and the second 
type  is  subjective  QoS  (such  as  QoS  evaluation  from  service  provider  and  client).  In  first 
phase, hypothesis testing method is applied to remove the uncertain outliers of the collected 
QoS objective data, and the ideal QoS value is estimated. In second phase, the credibility of 
the  subjective  evaluation  from  the  providers  and  customers  is  analyzed  to  obtain  the 
comprehensive evaluation of service. Finally, with the objective and subjective QoS data, the 
global  dynamic  service  composition  model  is  built  and  the  optimal  results  are  calculated. 
Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  approach  can  greatly  improve  the  accuracy  of 
service composition. 

The remainding paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 
describes a t-test  method  for  objective  and random  QoS.  Section  4  presents  QoS  evaluation 
based  on  direct  and  recommended  trust  for  subjective  QoS.  Section  5  proposes  dynamic 
optimal service composition with global QoS constraints. Section 6 presents experiments and 
Section 7 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Related Work 

Some  unsolved  problems  in  QoS-aware  services  composition  in  cloud  computing 
environment  cause  widespread  concerns  of  scholars.  So  far,  there  have  been  a  lot  of 
significant research results.  In  [1], the global QoS constraints are adaptively decomposed to 
local  constraints  with  preferences  of  users,  and  the  optimal  combination  of  services  is 
obtained  by  mixed  integer  programming  method  with  the  real-time  requirement.  In  [2],  the 
problem  of  QoS-aware  service  composition  is  taken  in  another  way  by  modeling  as  an 
extended  flexible  constraint  satisfaction  framework  and  is  solved  by  the  branch  and  bound 
algorithm.  In  [3],  the  author  classified  the  QoS  evaluation  criteria  into  two  categories: 
objective and subjective factors. Combining user preferences and QoS global constraint with 
the  Brown-Gibson  heuristic  algorithm  is  found  useful  to  calculate  the  optimal  aggregation 
value of QoS. All of the above methods have some progress in effectiveness and real-time of 
services optimal selection, but they generally lack considerations of dynamic QoS variability 
[4].  Consequently,  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  services  optimal  composition  cannot  be 
guaranteed. In [5], cloud model is employed to compute the uncertainty of QoS and Skyline 
algorithm is proposed to prune redundant services. As the range of searching is reduced, the 
efficiency of service composition is greatly increased. In [6], the uncertain attributes and non-
parametric  test  was  used  to  detect  historical  QoS  information  on  the  clients-side.  Then  the 
detected  result  is  taken  as  the  criteria  of  service  selection.  Although  above  mentioned  two 
methods considered the uncertainty of objective QoS, they just use the uncertainty degree for 
screening services. The stability of QoS is not substantially improved and the trust of Service 
composition cannot be guaranteed. The collaborative filtering approach is designed in [7, 8]. 
It takes advantage of the past QoS evaluations from users to predict the current QoS values, 
and  then  recommends  the  best  service.  In  [9],  the  authors  discussed  the  trusted  QoS 
evaluation  and  service  selection  with  environment  aware.  Although  the  QoS  evaluation 
structure  of  trust  reasoning  evolution  is  given  by  the  characteristic  vector,  the  credibility  is 
only expressed through gradient modulus of the difference between two evaluations, lacking 
of consideration on their own characteristics of evaluations. This results in the instability of 
success rate in services composition.

To summarize, the research on QoS-aware service composition made progresses in service 
composition  optimization,  QoS  uncertainty  criterion  and  service  reputation.  However,  few 
studies consider both QoS objective randomness and subjective trust evaluation together, and 
there are often large deviations between the actual demands and the results. The success rate 
and accuracy of service composition is not high. 
 
3. Outlier Test of Objective QoS 

For the randomness of objective QoS data, we employ hypothesis test to remove outliers 
and correct the QoS values. All attributes of QoS are calculated through statistical analysis, so 
that the accuracy of QoS can be improved.  

After  executing  service  several  times,  a  large  number  of  QoS  data  are  collected.  We 
assume all the data are derived from normal population and they follow a normal distribution. 
However, a few larger or smaller QoS data values also exist in the collected QoS. They are 
suspicious  and  they  need  to  be  t-tested.  Considering  the  tested  value    and  other  value 
               as samples from two independent normal population  (      ) and  (     ), 
to determine whether the value Y is credible, we judge whether    is equal to   under some 
significance level  (    [   ]). Therefore, we need to test the hypotheses as follows 

The test statistics is  

                        

   

                                                                ( )

When |     ̅|     

(     )    , Y is considered as an outlier and should be removed, 

otherwise kept.  

 

After  removing  the  outliers,  the  objective  QoS  data  follow  normal  distribution  (     ). 
For some attribute i (e.g., reliability), we can calculate its mathematic expectation  ( )     
with mean method and take this result as the QoS attribute value  ̂ ( ). 
 
4. Evaluation Models of subjective QoS  

There  are  two  types  of  QoS  evaluations:  Service  Provider  (SP)  evaluation  and  Service 
Client (SC) evaluation. Both the evaluations belong to subjective QoS attributes with human 
experiences  of  using  service  [10].  As  influenced  by  various  factors,  the  service  evaluation 
may  have  some  unreliable  information.  For  example,  some  SPs  may  publish  the  QoS 
evaluation  beyond  actual  level  to  attract  more  clients.  Under  the  influences  of  network 
environment, user context and preference of users, different users have different evaluations 
on the same cloud service. Furthermore, there may be false and malicious clients to raise or 
lower  the  evaluation  scores  of  some  services.  Consequently,  during  service  selection,

requestors should firstly identify the credibility of SP and SC, and then adopts or refuses their 
suggestions.  In  our  study,  we  propose  respectively  QoS  evaluation  models  based  on  direct 
and recommended trust, so that false evaluations of providers and users can be corrected. 
 
4.1. QoS Evaluation based on Direct Trust 

The  direct  trust  is  about  service  provider.  It  is  obtained  through  the  invoking  records  of 
service. That is to say, the direct trust is generated from multiple history interactions between 
users  and  the  services  supplied  by  SPs.  Here,  the  maximum  likelihood  method  is  used  to 
estimate the direct trust    . 

Given  the  direct  trust    ,  it  represents  user's  (   )  trust  degree  to  service  provider  (   ). 
Each  time  the  user     executes  the  service  provided  by    ,  he  records  an  invoking  result. 
The corresponding record is       {        }. Where,     is the times of successful execution, and 
     is  the  times  of  fail  execution.  After  collecting  all  users'  records    (            ),  the 
likelihood function for the global credibility    of provider is 

L(  𝑗    𝑗     𝑚𝑗; 𝜃 𝑗)   ∏ 𝜃𝑗

   (    𝜃𝑗)

      𝜃𝑗

  
  
∑
∑
      (    𝜃𝑗)
                  ( ) 
 

The log-likelihood function is 

   

𝑚

    (𝜃𝑗)   ∑   𝑗    𝜃𝑗  

   
      (𝜃𝑗)

 𝜃𝑗

 

∑   𝑗

∑   𝑗
   
    𝜃𝑗

                                              ( ) 

The  maximum  likelihood  estimate 𝜃̂𝑗 of 𝜃𝑗 is  the  direct  trust     of  the  service  provider. 
Hence, the final QoS evaluation of service provider                  , where,     is the initial 
QoS evaluation published by SP. 
 
4.2. QoS Evaluation based on Recommended Trust 

QoS evaluation based on recommended trust is about feedback information of clients after 
executing service. For the same service, the more similar evaluations of the requestor and user 
are, the higher recommending credibility of the users is. In our study, we regard the similarity 
between  the  requestor  and  user  as  the  recommended  trust  of  QoS  evaluation,  and  then 
aggregate  evaluations  of  different  users  though  the  recommended  trust.  The  accurate  QoS 
evaluation of current service is obtained finally. 

Given the service requestor i and the evaluating user j,    is the service set evaluated by the 
requestor  i  in  the  past,  and   𝑗 is  the  service  set  evaluated  by  the  user  j.   𝑗 is  the  service  set 
evaluated both by the requestor i and user j. So the similarity between requestor i and user j 
is: 

   (    )  

∑

     

(        ̅ )( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

 
√∑ (        ̅ )

    

 
√∑ ( 𝑗      ̅𝑗)

    

                                  ( ) 

where,      is  the  evaluation  of  service s for  the  user  i,  𝑗   is  the  evaluation  of  service  s  for 
the  user  j,  ̅   is  the  mean  evaluation  of  services  for  the  requestor  i  and  ̅𝑗  is  the  mean 

80

International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing 
Vol.7, No.1 (2014) 
 
 
evaluation  of  services  for  the  user  j.     (    )  is  the  evaluation  similarity  between  the 
requestor i and user j, and the range of its value is [-1, 1]. If     (    )    , the recommended 
trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to    (    ), while if    (    )    , the requestor i hasn’t trusted 
the user j and the recommended trust    𝑗 of the user j is equal to zero. 

Having calculated the recommended trust of clients, the formula of QoS evaluation     for 

the requestor is: 

∑

     

 
𝑗  
 
∑
𝑗  

   𝑗 𝑗   

   𝑗

                                                         ( ) 

Where,    𝑗 is the recommended trust of the user j for the requestor i and  𝑗    is the using 

evaluation of service    for the user j. 

After  weighted  aggregation  of  the  credible  evaluation  from  providers  and  clients,  the 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  service  quality  is  obtained.  It  is  calculated  by  the  following 
formula: 

           (     )                                                            ( ) 

Where,    

 

     ⁄

, here b is the number of evaluating users. (     ) makes the weight of 

users’ evaluation increase along with the growing number of users. Here, constant N controls 
the increasing speed of the weight. The value of N can be designed by different needs. When 
b=4N and  =0.2, the comprehensive evaluation has been determined basically by evaluations 
of users. If the user evaluation cannot be collected, let b=0. Then the service selection is only 
based on the provider’s evaluation. 
 
5. Global Optimal Service composition 

In  this  part  of  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  service  composition  with  global  QoS 
constraints.  According  to  the  requirements  of  service  function  and  QoS  attributes,  the  most 
appropriate  services  are  selected  from  many  candidate  services  to  form  a  greater  combined 
service. 

For  a  single  service,  after  the  above  process,  we  have  obtained  the  real  and  credible 
attributes  of  objective  and  subjective  QoS.  The  aggregated  function  of  QoS  weighted  by 
different attributes requirements is described as 

        ̂(  )     (  )                                                              (  ) 
Where,                              ,  (  ) is the comprehensive evaluation of the 
service    and  ̂(  ) is  the  objective  QoS  utility  value  of  service   .  Let  ̂(  )   ∑
 
 𝑗 ̂𝑗
, 
𝑗  
where  ̂𝑗 is the estimated value of objective  attribute  ,  𝑗 is the weight and z is the number 
of objective attributes. Therefore, formula (10) turns into the following function 

 

        ∑  𝑗 ̂𝑗

    (  )                                                        (  ) 

𝑗  

The  service  composition  problem  can  be  described  as  follows:  Given  m  tasks  (that  is,  m 
kinds  of  services  needed  to  compose)  in  a  workflow  and  n  candidate  services  in  each  task. 
The variable   𝑗 (                    ) is introduced. If the i-th task is performed by the j-th 
service (namely service    ), then        , else        . In this paper, the objective attributes of 
QoS include execution time, reliability, availability and throughput. The subjective attributes

are evaluations of SP and SC. Therefore, the total set of QoS attributes is  Q ={ T(execution 
time)   D(reliability)   U(availability)   H(throughput)     R(comprehensive  evaluation)}. 
Take the sequence execution for example, the decision objective functions of QoS in service 
composition is as follows: 

(1)execution time T:  

 

 

    ∑ ∑       

                                                              (  )

(  )

After taking logarithm, that is 

   

   

 

 

   ∏ ∑       

  

   

   

 

 

     ∑ ∑   (   )                                                         (  )
 

(4) throughput H: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑    

                                                               (  ) 

(5) comprehensive evaluation R: 

   

   

 

 

    ∑ ∑                                                                   (  )
 

   

   

After service selection, the QoS attributes of the services involved in combination should 
be all optimal ideally. But actually, they are restricted and conflicting with each other. So, not 
all  decision  objective  functions  can  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  NP-hard 
problem  with  multiple  dimension  and  choice  [13].  Accordingly,  a  compromise  is  needed 
between  the  objective  function  of  attributes  and  the  global  optimum.  And  then  a  relatively 
optimal or approximate optimal solution of QoS is obtained for the service composition. After 
normalization, the objective function of optimization is

In each instance of the service composition, user preferences about the quality attributes of 
the  service  are  decided  in  advance.  Accordingly,  for  each  service    𝑗  in  sequence 
 
composition, its ∑
   

 is an established utility value. Therefore, given

In  conclusion,  after  normalization,  the  global  constraint  optimization  model  of  service

Mixed  integer  programming  method  is  used  to  solve  the  above  optimization  model.  For 
each  task,  the  best  service  suitable  for  global  constraints  can  be  found  quickly  and  reliably 
from each service class. The optimal service composition is obtained finally. 
 
6. Experiment Results and Discussions 

In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we did related experiments by stages: (I) the 
comparative experiment about expectation and standard deviation of objective QoS data; (II) 
the  comparative  experiment  about  QoS  subjective  evaluation;  (III)  the  comparative 
experiment about optimal degree and deviation of service composition. One part of the  used 
data is from the real service set, while the other part of data is from the simulated data set. All 
experiments were performed in the same hardware and software environment (Pentium Dual 
2.4GHz, 2.0GB RAM, Windows 7, MATLAB7.0, Java 1.7). 
 
6.1. Comparing Subjective Evaluation of QoS Data 

We employed real service set for the experiment of QoS objective randomness. This data 
set  is  collected  from  142  distributed  computers  with  4,532  Web  services.  It  contains  two 
attributes of execution time and throughout [14]. 

In order to illustrate the algorithm can overcome influences of the random environment, we 
compare the proposed approach to the statistical method based on mean. As shown in Figure 
1,  our  t-test  method  can remove  outliers  of the  QoS data.  Accordingly,  the  relatively  stable 
expectations  (TME)  and  standard  deviation  (TSTD)  is  obtained.  However,  in  Figure  2,  the 
result of mean method has obvious and large fluctuations on either the expectation (TME) or 
the standard deviation (MSTD). Moreover, its deviation value is already hundred times more 
than ours.

We compare the experiments of the proposed algorithm (PRC) with other  two algorithms 
(the distance method (DIS) [15]} and the difference method (DIF) [16]). The result of each 
experiment is expressed by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of user evaluations. The formula of

In  Figure  3,  we  can  see  that  the  MAE  of  proposed  algorithm  (PRC)  is  lower  and  more 
stable  than  other  two  methods  (DIS  and  DIF).  Fig.4  shows  the  comprehensive  evaluation 
(CER) of providers and clients based trust. Given the ideal evaluation of each service is 0.5, 
N=100. The initial evaluations of clients are all supposed to be higher than real values. From 
the graph, along with the lower rate ( ) of false, the comprehensive evaluations are closer to 
the ideal 0.5. 
 
6.3. Comparing Optimal Degree and Deviation of Service Composition 

Two  data  sets  are  employed  in  this  part  of  experiment.  One  set  is  QWS  real  data 
[17.18,19], the other set is simualted data set. The optimal degree of service composition is 
defined as follows: 

    

       
     

  

Where,         is  object  value  of  global  optimization,       is  object  value  of  local  pure 
optimization.  In  Figure  5,  we  compare  the  result  of  proposed  global  dynamic  optimal 
composition(GCP)  with  the  local  pure  optimal  method(LPP).  Where,  GPC(3)  represents 
optimal degree of composition with 3 constraints (execution time, reliability and availability), 
and  GCD(5)  represents  optimal  degree  of  composition  with  5  constraints  (execution  time, 
reliability,availability,  throughout  and  comprehensive  evaluation).  Obviously,  GCP(3)  is 
higher than GCP(5), because the more constraints are, the stricter service selection is. This is 
also a good illustration that our dynamic optimization algorithm is quite effective.

The deviation rate of optimal degree is defined as follows: 

    |

              

     

|        

Where,        is  the  optimal  value  of  global  dynamic  composition,  and       is  the  real 
QoS aggregation value of service composition. Fig.6 shows the changes of the deviation rate 
of optimal degree in two composition patterns. GCPD represents the result of our method and

UTED represents  the result  without t-test  and  evaluation  model.  It  is  obviously  that  GCP is 
lower than UTED, and our method is proved to have a higher accuracy.As the QoS false rate 
increasing,  both  the  deviation  rates  of  GCPD  and  UTED  have  increasing  trends. 
However, the rise in UTED is significantly larger and quicker than GCPD. This proves 
GCPD  algorithm  has  better  stability.  Our  approach  of  GCPD  is  more  close  to  the 
optimal  goal.  This  because  GCPD  QoS  data  are  more  centralized  and  precise  after 
filtered  by  t-test  and  revised  by  the  trust  evaluation  model,  while  the  UTED  QoS  data 
contains obvious outliers and false values, which result in the inaccuracy of data.  
 
7. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposed  a  global  dynamic  service  composition  based  on  objective  QoS 
randomness and subjective trust evaluation in cloud computing environment. In contrast with 
previous  studies,  we  designed  a  more  comprehensive  multi-criteria  assessment  for  service 
quality,  considering  dynamic  influences  of  unstable  network  factors,  providers  and  clients. 
After  rejecting  QoS  outliers  values  and  revising  false  evaluations,  the  services  are  globally 
optimized  and  composed  with  objective  and  subjective  QoS  constraints.  The  experimented 
results proved that the algorithm is suitable for dynamically changing cloud environment and 
is able to guarantee the true quality of service composition.
