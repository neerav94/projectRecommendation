There are many e-learning softwares that is used 
extensively  in  various  levels  of  education,  such  as 
universities,  high  schools,  vocational  schools,  or 
junior.  E-learning  provides  multiple  benefits 
beyond  conventional  classroom-  based  learning. 
The biggest benefit is the reduction in costs due to 
the  IT  physical  environment  is  no  longer  needed 
and therefore it can be accessed from any place,  at 
any  time,  and  in  accordance  with  the  convenience 
of  students.  In  addition,  teachers  can  easily  update 
the  study  materials  and  incorporate  multimedia 
content  in  a  user  friendly  fashion,  making  them  
easier  for  students  to  understand  the  concepts. 
Finally,  e-learning  can  be  viewed  as  an  approach 
that  emphasizes  variation  of  learning  material  
between  teachers,  and    teachers  can  review  their 
own materials for improvement. 

However  there  are  some  drawbacks  that  should 
be  considered before  fully  integrate  e-learning  into 
the  academic  framework.  The  main  weakness  is  in 
terms  of  scalability  at  the  infrastructure  level.  
Some  resources  can  only  be  installed  for  certain 
tasks  so  that  when  they  are  burdened  with  heavy 

workloads,  they  require  additional  resources  and 
new  configurations.  This  certainly  adds  to  the  cost 
and becomes  expensive. 

The  key  issue  is  related  to  the  efficient  use  of 
these resources. For example, the lab PC and server 
will  be  underutilized  in  the  evening  and  semester 
holidays.  On 
the  other  hand,  resource  usage 
becomes very high during the day and the semester 
goes.  In  addition  it  should  also  consider  the  costs 
associated with computer maintenance and licenses 
for every software package used. 

 

The  rapid  growth  of  the  number  of  students,

exponential level. The challenge is how  to optimize 
computing  resources,  storage, 
  communication  
needs,  and  dynamic  concurrency  that  require    the

Currently,    educational  institutions  develop  e-
learning system on an individual basis. By running 
individually,  their  resources  become  less  efficient 
and  expensive,  since  they  have  to  invest  in  the 
computing infrastructure, perform the maintenance,

Cloud Computing is a technology services 
through  the  use of information on  the Internet, but 
not all of the services that exist on the Internet can 
be  categorized  as  a  Cloud  Computing  service. 
There are several requirements that must be met by 
an  internet-based  services  to  be  categorized    as 
cloud computing [2], namely: 1) The services must 
be  on  demand.  There  is  freedom  to  choose  any 
services provided by the provider and the users pay 
based  on  what  they  use,  2)  The  services    must  be 
elastic  or  scalable.  The  service  must  be  able  to 
accommodate the requests and needs of the user at 
any  time,  3)  The  Services  must  be  available  and 
fully  managed  by  the  provider  while  users  only 
need  an  Internet  connection  to  use  the  service,  4) 
The services must be measurable.  Cloud resources 
are  transparently  available,  can  be  optimized  and 
scalable,  and  become  a  reference  in  determining 
users'  needs,  5)  The  services  must  be  resource

resources that are grouped in one or many locations

multi-tenant  mechanism. 
  This  multi-tenant 
mechanism  allows  a  number  of  computing 
resources  be  used  jointly  by  a  number  of  users, 
because  these  resources,  either  in  the  form  of

There are many e-learning softwares that is used 
extensively  in  various  levels  of  education,  such  as 
universities,  high  schools,  vocational  schools,  or

beyond  conventional  classroom-  based  learning. 
The biggest benefit is the reduction in costs due to 
the  IT  physical  environment  is  no  longer  needed 
and therefore it can be accessed from any place,  at 
any  time,  and  in  accordance  with  the  convenience 
of  students.  In  addition,  teachers  can  easily  update 
the  study  materials  and  incorporate  multimedia 
content  in  a  user  friendly  fashion,  making  them  
easier  for  students  to  understand  the  concepts. 
Finally,  e-learning  can  be  viewed  as  an  approach 
that  emphasizes  variation  of  learning  material  
between  teachers,  and    teachers  can  review  their 
own materials for improvement. 

However  there  are  some  drawbacks  that  should 
be  considered before  fully  integrate  e-learning  into 
the  academic  framework.  The  main  weakness  is  in 
terms  of  scalability  at  the  infrastructure  level.  
Some  resources  can  only  be  installed  for  certain 
tasks  so  that  when  they  are  burdened  with  heavy 

workloads,  they  require  additional  resources  and 
new  configurations.  This  certainly  adds  to  the  cost 
and becomes  expensive. 

The  key  issue  is  related  to  the  efficient  use  of 
these resources. For example, the lab PC and server 
will  be  underutilized  in  the  evening  and  semester

the  other  hand,  resource  usage 
becomes very high during the day and the semester

for every software package used. 

 

The  rapid  growth  of  the  number  of  students, 
teaching  content,  services  provided  and  resources 
available,  has  made  e-learning  system  grow  at  an 
exponential level. The challenge is how  to optimize 
computing  resources,  storage,

hand, 
that  are 
necessary  to  give  a  concurrent  service  for  that

of  a  conventional  web  server.  Furthermore,  the 
demand of the teaching resources usually vary in a 
dynamic  and  very  quick  way,  and  presents  high 
peaks  of  activity.  To  attend  requests  during  these 
periods of time without other system services to be 
resented,  it  will  be  necessary  to  prepare  a  quite 
superior  infrastructure  than  that  required  for  the 
regular  working  of  the  learning  institution.  An 
alternative  would  be  to  provide  those  services 

Cloud  Computing  [5,  6]  is  a  computation 
paradigm  in  which  the  resources  of  an  IT  system 
are  offered  as  services,  available  to  the  users 
through  net  connections,  frequently  the  Internet.  It 
is  a  model  of  provision  of  IT  services  offered 
through a catalog that answers to the necessities of 
the user in a flexible and adaptive way, only billing 
for the actual usage that is made. Therefore, two of 
the distinctive features of this paradigm are, on the 
one  hand,  the  use  of  resources  under  demand  and, 
on the other hand, the transparent scalability in such 
a way that the computational resources are assigned 
in a dynamical and accurate manner when they are 
strictly  necessary,  without  the  requirement  of  a 
detailed  understanding  of  the  infrastructure  from 
the user’s point of view. 

E-Learning  in  the  cloud  can  be  seen  as 
Education  Software-as-a-Service.  The  installation 
can be done quickly, because of very low hardware 
requirements.  In  addition,  maintenance  is  also 
supported  by  the  vendor,  which    provides    system 
updates  and  allows  users    to  focus  on  their  core 
business of learning.

ABSTRACT 

 

The purpose of this article is to describe the model we implement  to provides services,  such as IaaS, PaaS, 
and  SaaS,    for  e-learning  and  collaboration  in  the  educational  environment  in  Salatiga.  Currently,  the 
combination  of  cloud  technology  and  e-learning  is  being  explored.  Several  efforts  of  using  IaaS  cloud 
technology  in  education  focus  on  the  reservation  of  the  VM  for  students.  This  research  used  Moodle 
technology  as  e-learning  applications  that  is  installed  on  the  Cloud.  Moodle  is  a  software  package  for    a 
training  purpose-  web  and  internet  based  training  commonly  known  as  a  Learning  Management  System 
(LMS),    Course  Management  System  (CMS),  or    Virtual  Learning  Environment  (VLE).  Moodle  is  free, 
since it is an open source software (under the GNU Public License). Features of Cloud Computing platform 
using the OpenStack method  quite appropriate for migration of learning system , so that it is able to form  
learning environments fully and efficiently, provide personalized contents, and  facilitate   the adaptation to 
the present model of education.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
 

There are many e-learning softwares that is used 
extensively  in  various  levels  of  education,  such  as 
universities,  high  schools,  vocational  schools,  or 
junior.  E-learning  provides  multiple  benefits 
beyond  conventional  classroom-  based  learning. 
The biggest benefit is the reduction in costs due to 
the  IT  physical  environment  is  no  longer  needed 
and therefore it can be accessed from any place,  at 
any  time,  and  in  accordance  with  the  convenience 
of  students.  In  addition,  teachers  can  easily  update 
the  study  materials  and  incorporate  multimedia 
content  in  a  user  friendly  fashion,  making  them  
easier  for  students  to  understand  the  concepts. 
Finally,  e-learning  can  be  viewed  as  an  approach 
that  emphasizes  variation  of  learning  material  
between  teachers,  and    teachers  can  review  their 
own materials for improvement. 

However  there  are  some  drawbacks  that  should 
be  considered before  fully  integrate  e-learning  into 
the  academic  framework.  The  main  weakness  is  in 
terms  of  scalability  at  the  infrastructure  level.  
Some  resources  can  only  be  installed  for  certain 
tasks  so  that  when  they  are  burdened  with  heavy 

workloads,  they  require  additional  resources  and 
new  configurations.  This  certainly  adds  to  the  cost 
and becomes  expensive. 

The  key  issue  is  related  to  the  efficient  use  of 
these resources. For example, the lab PC and server 
will  be  underutilized  in  the  evening  and  semester 
holidays.  On 
the  other  hand,  resource  usage 
becomes very high during the day and the semester 
goes.  In  addition  it  should  also  consider  the  costs 
associated with computer maintenance and licenses 
for every software package used. 

 

The  rapid  growth  of  the  number  of  students, 
teaching  content,  services  provided  and  resources 
available,  has  made  e-learning  system  grow  at  an 
exponential level. The challenge is how  to optimize 
computing  resources,  storage, 
  communication  
needs,  and  dynamic  concurrency  that  require    the 
use of appropriate platform with the scalability and 
cost  control.  For  such  problems,  many  educational 
institutions with limited resources and infrastructure 
then find themselves difficult to continually keep up 
with the growth.

Currently,    educational  institutions  develop  e-
learning system on an individual basis. By running 
individually,  their  resources  become  less  efficient 
and  expensive,  since  they  have  to  invest  in  the 
computing infrastructure, perform the maintenance, 
and 
is 
necessary  to  consider  the  application  of  e-learning

Cloud  Computing  is  a  computing  paradigm  in 
which  IT  resources  provide  a  variety  of  services, 
and  is    available  to  users  through  the  Internet 
connection.  It    is  the  provision  of  infrastructure, 
platform and software as a service (IaaS, PaaS, and 
SaaS)  on  the  basis  of    simply  pay  per  use  [1],  [2], 
[3].  In  other  words,  it  is  a  model  of  IT  services 
through  catalogs  that  address  users'  needs  in  a 
flexible and adaptive way, and only charge fees for 
their  actual  usage.  Therefore,  two  features  of  this 
paradigm  are  clear,  the  use  of  resources  on  the 
demand,  and 
that 
resources  needs  can  be  determined  accurately 
without having to know their  details.

resources 

The  Cloud 

references  a  distributed 
collection  of  computing  resources  where 
the 
applications can reside anywhere on  the accessible 
networks.  In  the  Cloud,  a  large  pool  of  accessible 
virtualized 
hardware, 
development platforms, and ideally services, can be 
dynamically  reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  scalable 
load,  with  minimal  management  effort  or  SP 
interaction.  This  pool  of  resources  is  typically 
exploited  by  a  pay-per-use  model  and 
the 
guarantees are offered by means of a Service Level 
Agreement (SLA). [2] 

such 

as 

In accordance with the definition from the 
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST) Information Technology Laboratory, Cloud 
Computing  actually  covers  more 
just 
computing  technology.  As  shown  in  the  three 
dimensional diagram of Figure 1, this Cloud model 
is  composed  of  five  essential  characteristics  (on-

demand 
self-service,  broad  network  access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity,  and  measured 
service),  three  service  models  (software,  platform, 
and  infrastructure),  and  four  deployment  models 
(Private,  Community,  Hybrid,  and  Public  Clouds).

Figure 1. The NIST’s model of Cloud computing[2] 

Cloud Computing is a technology services 
through  the  use of information on  the Internet, but 
not all of the services that exist on the Internet can 
be  categorized  as  a  Cloud  Computing  service. 
There are several requirements that must be met by 
an  internet-based  services  to  be  categorized    as 
cloud computing [2], namely: 1) The services must 
be  on  demand.  There  is  freedom  to  choose  any 
services provided by the provider and the users pay 
based  on  what  they  use,  2)  The  services    must  be 
elastic  or  scalable.  The  service  must  be  able  to 
accommodate the requests and needs of the user at 
any  time,  3)  The  Services  must  be  available  and 
fully  managed  by  the  provider  while  users  only 
need  an  Internet  connection  to  use  the  service,  4) 
The services must be measurable.  Cloud resources 
are  transparently  available,  can  be  optimized  and 
scalable,  and  become  a  reference  in  determining 
users'  needs,  5)  The  services  must  be  resource 
pooling. The Providers provide services through the 
resources that are grouped in one or many locations 
data  center  consisting  of  a  number  of  servers  with 
multi-tenant  mechanism. 
  This  multi-tenant 
mechanism  allows  a  number  of  computing 
resources  be  used  jointly  by  a  number  of  users, 
because  these  resources,  either  in  the  form  of 
physical or virtual, can be dynamically allocated on 
demand  needs.  Thus,  customers  do  not  need  to 
know  how  and  where  the  demand  for  computing 
resources met by the provider. What is important is 
that  every  request  can  be  fulfilled.  The  computing

Finally, Ouf et al in [8] give several values 
of cloud computing potential for education include: 
1) No back up  required both to drive and transfer 
from  one  platform  to  another.  This  means  that 
students  can  create 
information 
repository, 3)  Almost  no crash recovery  needed. If 
a    computer  crashes,  then  virtually  there  is  no 
missing  data,  because  everything  is  stored  in  the 
cloud,  4) Allowing access from a variety of places 
(home,  classroom,  library,  etc.).  Students  can  find  
and  edit  a  file  via  the  cloud.  In  addition,  browser-
based  applications 
  enable  students  to  access 
through  a  variety  of  platform  (mobile,  laptop  and 
PC),  6)  Flexibility.  Cloud  computing  allows  users 
to 
their  demand  for  cloud  services 
dynamically, 7)  Almost no stolen data. Since it is 
almost  impossible  for  students  to  determine  the 
location of the server that stores a desired data (test, 
exam  questions,  exam  results,  grades,  etc.),  8) 
Virtualization.    Cloud  computing  allows  quick 
replacement  of  servers  without  great  expense  or 
damage,  9)  Centralized  data  storage.  The  loss  of  a 
client  is  no  longer  an  issue,  because  the  main  part 
of  the  application  and  the  data  are  stored  in  the 
cloud  so  that  new  clients  can  be  connected  very 
quickly.  This  is  very  different  with  when  a  laptop 
that  stores  examination  questions    is  stolen,  10) 
 
Monitoring  data  access  becomes  easier 
given  the  fact  that  only  one  place  to  be  watched, 
even  though  there  are  thousands  of  computers 
spread  over  a  wide  geographical  area.  Also, 
changes in security procedures can easily be tested 
and applied.

ABSTRACT 

 

The purpose of this article is to describe the model we implement  to provides services,  such as IaaS, PaaS, 
and  SaaS,    for  e-learning  and  collaboration  in  the  educational  environment  in  Salatiga.  Currently,  the 
combination  of  cloud  technology  and  e-learning  is  being  explored.  Several  efforts  of  using  IaaS  cloud 
technology  in  education  focus  on  the  reservation  of  the  VM  for  students.  This  research  used  Moodle

1.  INTRODUCTION  
 

There are many e-learning softwares that is used 
extensively  in  various  levels  of  education,  such  as 
universities,  high  schools,  vocational  schools,  or 
junior.  E-learning  provides  multiple  benefits 
beyond  conventional  classroom-  based  learning. 
The biggest benefit is the reduction in costs due to 
the  IT  physical  environment  is  no  longer  needed 
and therefore it can be accessed from any place,  at 
any  time,  and  in  accordance  with  the  convenience 
of  students.  In  addition,  teachers  can  easily  update 
the  study  materials  and  incorporate  multimedia 
content  in  a  user  friendly  fashion,  making  them  
easier  for  students  to  understand  the  concepts. 
Finally,  e-learning  can  be  viewed  as  an  approach 
that  emphasizes  variation  of  learning  material  
between  teachers,  and    teachers  can  review  their 
own materials for improvement. 

However  there  are  some  drawbacks  that  should 
be  considered before  fully  integrate  e-learning  into 
the  academic  framework.  The  main  weakness  is  in 
terms  of  scalability  at  the  infrastructure  level.  
Some  resources  can  only  be  installed  for  certain 
tasks  so  that  when  they  are  burdened  with  heavy 

workloads,  they  require  additional  resources  and 
new  configurations.  This  certainly  adds  to  the  cost 
and becomes  expensive. 

The  key  issue  is  related  to  the  efficient  use  of 
these resources. For example, the lab PC and server 
will  be  underutilized  in  the  evening  and  semester 
holidays.  On 
the  other  hand,  resource  usage 
becomes very high during the day and the semester 
goes.  In  addition  it  should  also  consider  the  costs 
associated with computer maintenance and licenses 
for every software package used. 

 

The  rapid  growth  of  the  number  of  students, 
teaching  content,  services  provided  and  resources 
available,  has  made  e-learning  system  grow  at  an 
exponential level. The challenge is how  to optimize 
computing  resources,  storage, 
  communication  
needs,  and  dynamic  concurrency  that  require    the 
use of appropriate platform with the scalability and 
cost  control.  For  such  problems,  many  educational 
institutions with limited resources and infrastructure 
then find themselves difficult to continually keep up 
with the growth.

Currently,    educational  institutions  develop  e-
learning system on an individual basis. By running 
individually,  their  resources  become  less  efficient 
and  expensive,  since  they  have  to  invest  in  the 
computing infrastructure, perform the maintenance, 
and 
is 
necessary  to  consider  the  application  of  e-learning 
with  the  public  infrastructure,  which  is  developed 
on the basis of cloud computing technology.

Cloud  Computing  is  a  computing  paradigm  in 
which  IT  resources  provide  a  variety  of  services, 
and  is    available  to  users  through  the  Internet 
connection.  It    is  the  provision  of  infrastructure, 
platform and software as a service (IaaS, PaaS, and 
SaaS)  on  the  basis  of    simply  pay  per  use  [1],  [2], 
[3].  In  other  words,  it  is  a  model  of  IT  services 
through  catalogs  that  address  users'  needs  in  a 
flexible and adaptive way, and only charge fees for 
their  actual  usage.  Therefore,  two  features  of  this 
paradigm  are  clear,  the  use  of  resources  on  the 
demand,  and 
that 
resources  needs  can  be  determined  accurately 
without having to know their  details.

resources 

The  Cloud 

references  a  distributed 
collection  of  computing  resources  where 
the 
applications can reside anywhere on  the accessible 
networks.  In  the  Cloud,  a  large  pool  of  accessible 
virtualized 
hardware, 
development platforms, and ideally services, can be 
dynamically  reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  scalable 
load,  with  minimal  management  effort  or  SP 
interaction.  This  pool  of  resources  is  typically 
exploited  by  a  pay-per-use  model  and 
the 
guarantees are offered by means of a Service Level 
Agreement (SLA). [2] 

such 

as 

In accordance with the definition from the 
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST) Information Technology Laboratory, Cloud 
Computing  actually  covers  more 
just 
computing  technology.  As  shown  in  the  three 
dimensional diagram of Figure 1, this Cloud model 
is  composed  of  five  essential  characteristics  (on-

demand 
self-service,  broad  network  access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity,  and  measured 
service),  three  service  models  (software,  platform, 
and  infrastructure),  and  four  deployment  models 
(Private,  Community,  Hybrid,  and  Public  Clouds).

Figure 1. The NIST’s model of Cloud computing[2] 

Cloud Computing is a technology services 
through  the  use of information on  the Internet, but 
not all of the services that exist on the Internet can 
be  categorized  as  a  Cloud  Computing  service. 
There are several requirements that must be met by 
an  internet-based  services  to  be  categorized    as 
cloud computing [2], namely: 1) The services must 
be  on  demand.  There  is  freedom  to  choose  any 
services provided by the provider and the users pay 
based  on  what  they  use,  2)  The  services    must  be 
elastic  or  scalable.  The  service  must  be  able  to 
accommodate the requests and needs of the user at 
any  time,  3)  The  Services  must  be  available  and 
fully  managed  by  the  provider  while  users  only 
need  an  Internet  connection  to  use  the  service,  4) 
The services must be measurable.  Cloud resources 
are  transparently  available,  can  be  optimized  and 
scalable,  and  become  a  reference  in  determining 
users'  needs,  5)  The  services  must  be  resource 
pooling. The Providers provide services through the 
resources that are grouped in one or many locations 
data  center  consisting  of  a  number  of  servers  with 
multi-tenant  mechanism. 
  This  multi-tenant 
mechanism  allows  a  number  of  computing 
resources  be  used  jointly  by  a  number  of  users, 
because  these  resources,  either  in  the  form  of 
physical or virtual, can be dynamically allocated on 
demand  needs.  Thus,  customers  do  not  need  to 
know  how  and  where  the  demand  for  computing 
resources met by the provider. What is important is 
that  every  request  can  be  fulfilled.  The  computing

infrastructure  provisions 

The  virtual  courses  that  are  supported  by 
the e-Learning approach favors the achievement of 
a  higher  impact  for  the  educative  framework  than 
those  of  the  classical  attendance  group.  As  an 
example,  in  the  first  edition  of  the  “Machine 
Learning”  course  of  Stanford2  more  than  160,000 
worldwide 
registered.  These 
dimensions  affects  different  issues;  on  the  one 
hand, 
that  are 
necessary  to  give  a  concurrent  service  for  that 
amount  of  students  clearly  exceed  the  capabilities 
of  a  conventional  web  server.  Furthermore,  the 
demand of the teaching resources usually vary in a 
dynamic  and  very  quick  way,  and  presents  high 
peaks  of  activity.  To  attend  requests  during  these 
periods of time without other system services to be 
resented,  it  will  be  necessary  to  prepare  a  quite 
superior  infrastructure  than  that  required  for  the 
regular  working  of  the  learning  institution.  An 
alternative  would  be  to  provide  those  services 

Cloud  Computing  [5,  6]  is  a  computation 
paradigm  in  which  the  resources  of  an  IT  system 
are  offered  as  services,  available  to  the  users 
through  net  connections,  frequently  the  Internet.  It 
is  a  model  of  provision  of  IT  services  offered 
through a catalog that answers to the necessities of 
the user in a flexible and adaptive way, only billing 
for the actual usage that is made. Therefore, two of 
the distinctive features of this paradigm are, on the 
one  hand,  the  use  of  resources  under  demand  and, 
on the other hand, the transparent scalability in such 
a way that the computational resources are assigned 
in a dynamical and accurate manner when they are 
strictly  necessary,  without  the  requirement  of  a 
detailed  understanding  of  the  infrastructure  from 
the user’s point of view. 

E-Learning  in  the  cloud  can  be  seen  as 
Education  Software-as-a-Service.  The  installation 
can be done quickly, because of very low hardware 
requirements.  In  addition,  maintenance  is  also 
supported  by  the  vendor,  which    provides    system 
updates  and  allows  users    to  focus  on  their  core 
business of learning. 

The 

following  are  consequences  and 
implications associated  with the development of e-
learning in  the cloud environment as demonstrated 
by  Masud-Huang  [7]:  1)  Accessed  via  the  Web. 
This reflects the ease of access from anywhere, and 
anytime  people  can  access  the  application,2)  Does 
not  require  any  software  on 
the  client-side. 
Therefore, this will reduce costs for users, since  no 
installation, software maintenance, deployment, and 
server  administration  costs.  In  other  words,    the 
total  cost  of  ownership  is  lower,  the  time  to 
implement  is  shorter,    and  the  number  IT  staff 
required  is  fewer,  3)  Pay  per  use,  4)  SaaS  Server 
can support many educational institutions. Since the 
applications run in the server group, then scalability 
is  maintained,  for  example,  if  the  number  of 
studens  who  use  the  system  is  increased,  the 
performce  will  not  degraded,  5)  All  customer  data 
is  at  SaaS  Server.  Therefore,  the  SaaS  provider 
needs  a  high  level  of  security  system  and  a 
sophisticated software architecture  to gain the trust 
of customers .

Finally, Ouf et al in [8] give several values 
of cloud computing potential for education include: 
1) No back up  required both to drive and transfer 
from  one  platform  to  another.  This  means  that 
students  can  create 
information 
repository, 3)  Almost  no crash recovery  needed. If 
a    computer  crashes,  then  virtually  there  is  no 
missing  data,  because  everything  is  stored  in  the 
cloud,  4) Allowing access from a variety of places 
(home,  classroom,  library,  etc.).  Students  can  find  
and  edit  a  file  via  the  cloud.  In  addition,  browser-
based  applications 
  enable  students  to  access 
through  a  variety  of  platform  (mobile,  laptop  and 
PC),  6)  Flexibility.  Cloud  computing  allows  users 
to 
their  demand  for  cloud  services 
dynamically, 7)  Almost no stolen data. Since it is 
almost  impossible  for  students  to  determine  the 
location of the server that stores a desired data (test, 
exam  questions,  exam  results,  grades,  etc.),  8) 
Virtualization.    Cloud  computing  allows  quick 
replacement  of  servers  without  great  expense  or 
damage,  9)  Centralized  data  storage.  The  loss  of  a 
client  is  no  longer  an  issue,  because  the  main  part 
of  the  application  and  the  data  are  stored  in  the 
cloud  so  that  new  clients  can  be  connected  very 
quickly.  This  is  very  different  with  when  a  laptop 
that  stores  examination  questions    is  stolen,  10) 
 
Monitoring  data  access  becomes  easier 
given  the  fact  that  only  one  place  to  be  watched, 
even  though  there  are  thousands  of  computers

changes in security procedures can easily be tested 
and applied.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
 

There are many e-learning softwares that is used 
extensively  in  various  levels  of  education,  such  as 
universities,  high  schools,  vocational  schools,  or 
junior.  E-learning  provides  multiple  benefits 
beyond  conventional  classroom-  based  learning. 
The biggest benefit is the reduction in costs due to 
the  IT  physical  environment  is  no  longer  needed 
and therefore it can be accessed from any place,  at 
any  time,  and  in  accordance  with  the  convenience 
of  students.  In  addition,  teachers  can  easily  update 
the  study  materials  and  incorporate  multimedia 
content  in  a  user  friendly  fashion,  making  them  
easier  for  students  to  understand  the  concepts. 
Finally,  e-learning  can  be  viewed  as  an  approach 
that  emphasizes  variation  of  learning  material  
between  teachers,  and    teachers  can  review  their 
own materials for improvement. 

However  there  are  some  drawbacks  that  should 
be  considered before  fully  integrate  e-learning  into 
the  academic  framework.  The  main  weakness  is  in 
terms  of  scalability  at  the  infrastructure  level.  
Some  resources  can  only  be  installed  for  certain 
tasks  so  that  when  they  are  burdened  with  heavy 

workloads,  they  require  additional  resources  and 
new  configurations.  This  certainly  adds  to  the  cost 
and becomes  expensive. 

The  key  issue  is  related  to  the  efficient  use  of 
these resources. For example, the lab PC and server 
will  be  underutilized  in  the  evening  and  semester 
holidays.  On 
the  other  hand,  resource  usage 
becomes very high during the day and the semester 
goes.  In  addition  it  should  also  consider  the  costs 
associated with computer maintenance and licenses 
for every software package used. 

 

The  rapid  growth  of  the  number  of  students, 
teaching  content,  services  provided  and  resources 
available,  has  made  e-learning  system  grow  at  an 
exponential level. The challenge is how  to optimize 
computing  resources,  storage, 
  communication  
needs,  and  dynamic  concurrency  that  require    the 
use of appropriate platform with the scalability and 
cost  control.  For  such  problems,  many  educational 
institutions with limited resources and infrastructure 
then find themselves difficult to continually keep up 
with the growth.

Currently,    educational  institutions  develop  e-
learning system on an individual basis. By running 
individually,  their  resources  become  less  efficient 
and  expensive,  since  they  have  to  invest  in  the 
computing infrastructure, perform the maintenance, 
and 
is 
necessary  to  consider  the  application  of  e-learning 
with  the  public  infrastructure,  which  is  developed 
on the basis of cloud computing technology.

Cloud  Computing  is  a  computing  paradigm  in 
which  IT  resources  provide  a  variety  of  services, 
and  is    available  to  users  through  the  Internet 
connection.  It    is  the  provision  of  infrastructure, 
platform and software as a service (IaaS, PaaS, and 
SaaS)  on  the  basis  of    simply  pay  per  use  [1],  [2], 
[3].  In  other  words,  it  is  a  model  of  IT  services 
through  catalogs  that  address  users'  needs  in  a 
flexible and adaptive way, and only charge fees for 
their  actual  usage.  Therefore,  two  features  of  this 
paradigm  are  clear,  the  use  of  resources  on  the 
demand,  and 
that 
resources  needs  can  be  determined  accurately 
without having to know their  details.

The  Cloud 

references  a  distributed 
collection  of  computing  resources  where 
the 
applications can reside anywhere on  the accessible 
networks.  In  the  Cloud,  a  large  pool  of  accessible 
virtualized 
hardware, 
development platforms, and ideally services, can be 
dynamically  reconfigured  to  adjust  to  a  scalable 
load,  with  minimal  management  effort  or  SP 
interaction.  This  pool  of  resources  is  typically 
exploited  by  a  pay-per-use  model  and 
the 
guarantees are offered by means of a Service Level 
Agreement (SLA). [2]

Figure 1. The NIST’s model of Cloud computing[2] 

Cloud Computing is a technology services 
through  the  use of information on  the Internet, but 
not all of the services that exist on the Internet can 
be  categorized  as  a  Cloud  Computing  service. 
There are several requirements that must be met by 
an  internet-based  services  to  be  categorized    as 
cloud computing [2], namely: 1) The services must 
be  on  demand.  There  is  freedom  to  choose  any 
services provided by the provider and the users pay 
based  on  what  they  use,  2)  The  services    must  be 
elastic  or  scalable.  The  service  must  be  able  to 
accommodate the requests and needs of the user at 
any  time,  3)  The  Services  must  be  available  and 
fully  managed  by  the  provider  while  users  only 
need  an  Internet  connection  to  use  the  service,  4) 
The services must be measurable.  Cloud resources 
are  transparently  available,  can  be  optimized  and 
scalable,  and  become  a  reference  in  determining 
users'  needs,  5)  The  services  must  be  resource 
pooling. The Providers provide services through the 
resources that are grouped in one or many locations 
data  center  consisting  of  a  number  of  servers  with 
multi-tenant  mechanism. 
  This  multi-tenant 
mechanism  allows  a  number  of  computing 
resources  be  used  jointly  by  a  number  of  users, 
because  these  resources,  either  in  the  form  of 
physical or virtual, can be dynamically allocated on 
demand  needs.  Thus,  customers  do  not  need  to 
know  how  and  where  the  demand  for  computing 
resources met by the provider. What is important is 
that  every  request  can  be  fulfilled.  The  computing

infrastructure  provisions 

The  virtual  courses  that  are  supported  by 
the e-Learning approach favors the achievement of 
a  higher  impact  for  the  educative  framework  than 
those  of  the  classical  attendance  group.  As  an 
example,  in  the  first  edition  of  the  “Machine 
Learning”  course  of  Stanford2  more  than  160,000 
worldwide 
registered.  These 
dimensions  affects  different  issues;  on  the  one 
hand, 
that  are 
necessary  to  give  a  concurrent  service  for  that 
amount  of  students  clearly  exceed  the  capabilities 
of  a  conventional  web  server.  Furthermore,  the 
demand of the teaching resources usually vary in a 
dynamic  and  very  quick  way,  and  presents  high 
peaks  of  activity.  To  attend  requests  during  these 
periods of time without other system services to be 
resented,  it  will  be  necessary  to  prepare  a  quite 
superior  infrastructure  than  that  required  for  the 
regular  working  of  the  learning  institution.  An 
alternative  would  be  to  provide  those  services 

Cloud  Computing  [5,  6]  is  a  computation 
paradigm  in  which  the  resources  of  an  IT  system 
are  offered  as  services,  available  to  the  users 
through  net  connections,  frequently  the  Internet.  It 
is  a  model  of  provision  of  IT  services  offered 
through a catalog that answers to the necessities of 
the user in a flexible and adaptive way, only billing 
for the actual usage that is made. Therefore, two of 
the distinctive features of this paradigm are, on the 
one  hand,  the  use  of  resources  under  demand  and, 
on the other hand, the transparent scalability in such 
a way that the computational resources are assigned 
in a dynamical and accurate manner when they are 
strictly  necessary,  without  the  requirement  of  a 
detailed  understanding  of  the  infrastructure  from 
the user’s point of view. 

E-Learning  in  the  cloud  can  be  seen  as 
Education  Software-as-a-Service.  The  installation 
can be done quickly, because of very low hardware 
requirements.  In  addition,  maintenance  is  also 
supported  by  the  vendor,  which    provides    system 
updates  and  allows  users    to  focus  on  their  core 
business of learning. 

The 

following  are  consequences  and 
implications associated  with the development of e-
learning in  the cloud environment as demonstrated 
by  Masud-Huang  [7]:  1)  Accessed  via  the  Web. 
This reflects the ease of access from anywhere, and 
anytime  people  can  access  the  application,2)  Does 
not  require  any  software  on 
the  client-side. 
Therefore, this will reduce costs for users, since  no 
installation, software maintenance, deployment, and 
server  administration  costs.  In  other  words,    the 
total  cost  of  ownership  is  lower,  the  time  to 
implement  is  shorter,    and  the  number  IT  staff 
required  is  fewer,  3)  Pay  per  use,  4)  SaaS  Server 
can support many educational institutions. Since the 
applications run in the server group, then scalability 
is  maintained,  for  example,  if  the  number  of 
studens  who  use  the  system  is  increased,  the 
performce  will  not  degraded,  5)  All  customer  data 
is  at  SaaS  Server.  Therefore,  the  SaaS  provider 
needs  a  high  level  of  security  system  and  a 
sophisticated software architecture  to gain the trust 
of customers .

Finally, Ouf et al in [8] give several values 
of cloud computing potential for education include: 
1) No back up  required both to drive and transfer 
from  one  platform  to  another.  This  means  that 
students  can  create 
information 
repository, 3)  Almost  no crash recovery  needed. If 
a    computer  crashes,  then  virtually  there  is  no 
missing  data,  because  everything  is  stored  in  the 
cloud,  4) Allowing access from a variety of places 
(home,  classroom,  library,  etc.).  Students  can  find  
and  edit  a  file  via  the  cloud.  In  addition,  browser-
based  applications 
  enable  students  to  access 
through  a  variety  of  platform  (mobile,  laptop  and 
PC),  6)  Flexibility.  Cloud  computing  allows  users 
to 
their  demand  for  cloud  services 
dynamically, 7)  Almost no stolen data. Since it is 
almost  impossible  for  students  to  determine  the 
location of the server that stores a desired data (test, 
exam  questions,  exam  results,  grades,  etc.),  8) 
Virtualization.    Cloud  computing  allows  quick 
replacement  of  servers  without  great  expense  or 
damage,  9)  Centralized  data  storage.  The  loss  of  a 
client  is  no  longer  an  issue,  because  the  main  part 
of  the  application  and  the  data  are  stored  in  the 
cloud  so  that  new  clients  can  be  connected  very 
quickly.  This  is  very  different  with  when  a  laptop 
that  stores  examination  questions    is  stolen,  10) 
 
Monitoring  data  access  becomes  easier 
given  the  fact  that  only  one  place  to  be  watched, 
even  though  there  are  thousands  of  computers 
spread  over  a  wide  geographical  area.  Also, 
changes in security procedures can easily be tested 
and applied.

petabytes. 

the  cloud  and 
the  virtualization 
hardware, will reduce the cost of developing of and 
maintenance  of  learning  resources  significantly.  
Currently, the combination of cloud technology and 
e-learning  is  being  explored.  Several  efforts  of 
using IaaS cloud technology  in education  focus on 
the reservation of the VM for students. 

This  research  used  Moodle  technology  as 
e-learning applications that is installed on the Cloud 
(Figure  5).  Moodle  is  a  software  package  for    a 
training  purpose-  web  and  internet  based  training 
commonly  known  as  a  Learning  Management 
System  (LMS), 
  Course  Management  System 
(CMS),  or    Virtual  Learning  Environment  (VLE). 
Moodle is free, since it is an open source software 
(under the GNU Public License). 

The  entire  OpenStack  code  is  under  the 
Apache 2.0 license. This  allows  anyone to run, or 
build  other  software  on  OpenStack  software,  or 
send  modified  codes  either  as  a  patch  or  new 
features. 

Currently  OpenStack  has  been  used  by 
large  hosting  companies  like  Rackspace  Hosting 
and  NASA.  They  use  this  technology  to  manage 
tens of thousands compute instances and storage in 
petabytes size. 

Figure 5  Model Of E-Learning Using Moodle Installed

Moodle  provides  7  layers  of  users  as 
follows:  1)  Administrator.  An  administrator  is  the 
person  who  manages  the  site  in  general  such  as 
website    displays,  menus,  or  users'  privilege  s 
(roles);  2)  Course  Creator.  A  course  creator  is  a 
person  who  can  create  a  course  subject,  teach  the 
subject,    assign  another  teacher    to  teach  the 
subject,  or  monitor    subjects    that  have    not  been 
published.  This  role  is  usually  performed  by  the 
head of study program; 3)  Teacher. A teacher is the 
person  who  manage  a  taught  subject,  e.g  changing 
the  activity  of  course,  giving    marks,dropping  out  
students  ,  or  appointing  a  non  editing  teacher  to 
teach  the  subject;  4)  Non-editing  teacher.  A  non-
editing teacher is a teacher who can teach a subject, 
such as giving marks, but he/she cannot change the 
activities created by a taught teacher. A non-editing 
teacher can be considered as an assistant teacher or 
lecturer;  5)  Student.    A  student  is  a  user  who  is
