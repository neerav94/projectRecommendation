Cloud Computing is a new technology which is directly connected with the internet which provide on demand self 
service internet infrastructure where a customer can pay and use only what is needed. Cloud Computing all services 
are managed by third party cloud service provider. Nowadays majority using static password to login into the system 
or access the online accounts in cloud but never change the password which is not secure . Since Cloud computing is a 
quite  new  subject,  most  of  the  cloud  providers  have  not  yet  tighten  up  their  security  and  still  use  insecure  or 
complicated login method. Static password thoroughly investigated and found out that it is not completing the cloud 
computing  security  requirement.  Proposed  solution  is  One  Time  Password  and  One  Day  Password,  OTP  will  get 
expire after two minutes, if user again login will request and receive new password via email  and ODP will get expire 
after  24  hours  and  on  request  receive  new  password  via  email  for  new  login  session.  OTP/ODP  used  with  AES 
encryption. This paper focuses the authentication and transmission encryption in cloud computing services.

the  full  benefits  of  cloud 
computing  when 
third  party  cloud  service  providers 
provide  the  proper  security  which  can  secure    people 
confidential  information and data. People lost their control 
on  the  their  data  when  it  moves  on  cloud  and  third  party 
cloud  service  provider  take  care  of  all  operations.  Cloud 
computing  security  should  be  very  secure  and  reliable 
otherwise  the  people  confidential  information  will  get 
compromise.  People  Still  Using  the  same  passwords  to 
access  the  different  accounts  on  the  cloud  which  is  very 
insecure and third party cloud computing service providers 
are  not  providing  proper  security  about  static  passwords. 
This  his  is  the  big  disadvantage  of  the  cloud  computing 
environment  because  static  password  can  be  attacked  by 
unathorised  user  and    account  information  can  be  easily 
taken  by  hackers. The solution  of this security  problem is 
the  introduction  of  one  time  password/One  Day  password 
with AES encryption.OTP validity is two minutes and ODP 
validity  is  24  hours,  after  the  specified  time  limit  the 
passwords  will  get  expire  .The  AES  encryption  algorithm

some  of  them  are  insecure.  The  main  weakness    static 
password is that if it is simple it can be easily attacked by

A static password is the usual way that a user authenticate 
when log in to a service is needed. The password is usually 
a  secret  word  or  phrase  picked  by  the  user  and  used 
together  with  the  user's  username.  It  can  be  used  when 
logging  in  to  your  own  personal  computer,  an  e-mail

3.aTopaTwentyaPassword  
 
In  an  article  from  January  2010,  a  list  of  32  million 
passwords 
in  an  attack,  have  been 
examined.  The  number  one  most  popular  password 
used by  most users was 123456, and the top 32 password 
was all bad from a security point of view. The password list 
was further studied in a report from the security company 
Imperva.  In  that  report  it  is  stated  that  about  30%  of  the 
passwords  had  a  length  of  six  characters  or  below. 
Furthermore, 60% of the password only used a limited set 
of the most common characters and half the passwords on 
the list was based on names, slang, dictionary word or other 
forms of simple passwords. This shows a clear example on 
how static passwords can't meet today's security standards. 
The following picture shows the top 20 passwords from the 
password  list.  Table  captions  appear  centered  above  the 
table in upper and  lower case letters.  When referring  to  a 
table  in  the  text,  no  abbreviation  is  used  and  "Table"  is 
capitalized.

This is very common nowadays hackers use the software’s 
to capture the password and people often don’t use SSL and 
encryption  therefore  it  become  very  easy  for  attackers  to

5.aOneaTimeapassword/Oneadayapassword  
One  time  password  is  best  solution  as  compare  to  static 
passwords    in  cloud  environment  because  in  this  method 
every time users get login but with the new password. The 
password get expire within two minutes but session will be 
activated but when users again login he/she will be given a 
new password so this cycle will continue, if hackers capture 
the  packets  and  decrypt  the  AES  encrypted  password  and 
user  Id    it  will  be  useless  because  password  get  change 
within  two  minutes.  Same  procedure  apply  on  one  day 
password  after  24  hours  password  get  change.    It  means 
that  this  application  can  be  used  in  both  situations  either 
packets are encrypted or not.   
A.  User Sign Up Process 
This new technique of user sign up has been added with the 
feature  of  OTP  and  ODP  by  which  the  users  can  decide 
uponatheiratypeaofatheausabilityaandatheasecurity.  
 
• A non frequent  user uses  OTP (one  time  password) and 
always  gets  the  new  password  for  each  access  and  hence 
providing 
access.  
• A frequent user go for ODP (One Day Password) so that 
the user need not change the password on. 
Means  that    according  to  users  designation,  level  of 
privileges are defined.     
 
6.aEncryptionaTechnique 
AES  has 
for 
in 
authentication  during  transmission.  AES  as  compare  to 
RSA, DSA, and RC4 is much better encryption technique 
because 
its  algorithm  fast  and  reliable.  We  have 
introduced OTP/ODP with the AES encryption these two 
security  factors  together  produce  firm  authentication 
results.  AES  is  very  fast  and  reliable  algorithm  which 
confirm the user authentication in a proper way.  
 
7.  Proposed Security Solutions 
There are ways to have a secure and easy-to-use cloud 
service that can satisfy these criteria’s:

2.    Have  an  easy-to-understand    registration    system,  that   
     at  the  same  time  doesn't  compromise  the  security.  
3.  Use  an  encryption  algorithm  that  is  secure    but    also   
     fast, to be able to serve the vast amount of cloud users.       
4.  Offer  a  solution  that  is  free  of      charge  in  order  to   
     attract  more  customers 
services.  
5.  In  overall,  the  security  solution  for  cloud  services  
     must  be  easy  to  use,  but  also  be  very  secure  in  order   
     to  protect  the  customers'  data  and  gain  the  trust  of    
     the customers.

This is the first Screen when member will try to login into 
the system  but first the person will receive new password  
in the email then will get login permission. The user name 
will be the same as enter during registration but password 
will be changed within two minutes or 24 hours.  
 

permission otherwise the password will be issued.  
   
B. Additional Security Layer 
 Get password mechanism is very simple and easy again in 
this  screen  not  email  is  available  which  means  that  if 
hacker somehow  get the  user  token and  password  but  not 
be  sure  about  the  email  address,  this  technique  add 
additional security into the application. This application is 
very  secure  and  capable  to  secure  the  companies  or 
individual information  and data in  a  very efficient way  in 
cloud environment. 
 
10.aRegistrationaProcess 
 
The registration process is very simple which can use  by 
both  professional  and  new  user.  The  below  Screen  shows 
the registration process where users enter their details.

This  is  the  Post  Screen  the  user  will  enter  the  user  name 
and token and receive password via email, validity will be 
two minutes or one day after  specified time  the password 
will get expire.

Cloud Computing is a new technology which is directly connected with the internet which provide on demand self 
service internet infrastructure where a customer can pay and use only what is needed. Cloud Computing all services 
are managed by third party cloud service provider. Nowadays majority using static password to login into the system 
or access the online accounts in cloud but never change the password which is not secure . Since Cloud computing is a 
quite  new  subject,  most  of  the  cloud  providers  have  not  yet  tighten  up  their  security  and  still  use  insecure  or 
complicated login method. Static password thoroughly investigated and found out that it is not completing the cloud 
computing  security  requirement.  Proposed  solution  is  One  Time  Password  and  One  Day  Password,  OTP  will  get 
expire after two minutes, if user again login will request and receive new password via email  and ODP will get expire 
after  24  hours  and  on  request  receive  new  password  via  email  for  new  login  session.  OTP/ODP  used  with  AES 
encryption. This paper focuses the authentication and transmission encryption in cloud computing services.

1.aIntroduction 
People  can  only  enjoy 

the  full  benefits  of  cloud 
computing  when 
third  party  cloud  service  providers 
provide  the  proper  security  which  can  secure    people 
confidential  information and data. People lost their control 
on  the  their  data  when  it  moves  on  cloud  and  third  party 
cloud  service  provider  take  care  of  all  operations.  Cloud 
computing  security  should  be  very  secure  and  reliable 
otherwise  the  people  confidential  information  will  get 
compromise.  People  Still  Using  the  same  passwords  to 
access  the  different  accounts  on  the  cloud  which  is  very 
insecure and third party cloud computing service providers 
are  not  providing  proper  security  about  static  passwords. 
This  his  is  the  big  disadvantage  of  the  cloud  computing 
environment  because  static  password  can  be  attacked  by 
unathorised  user  and    account  information  can  be  easily 
taken  by  hackers. The solution  of this security  problem is 
the  introduction  of  one  time  password/One  Day  password 
with AES encryption.OTP validity is two minutes and ODP 
validity  is  24  hours,  after  the  specified  time  limit  the 
passwords  will  get  expire  .The  AES  encryption  algorithm 
has  used  to  provide  the  security  about  authentication.  
These two security factors AES encryption and OTP/ODP 
improve  the  security  performance  and  reliability  in  cloud 
computing environment.   
 
2.aStaticaPassword 
 
The  static  password  always  create  problem  and  people 
often use the same password more then one account which 
means  that  if  one  account  password  get  hack  then  rest  of 
the accounts also  get compromise  on cloud. People rarely 
change their passwords but not in days, weeks, months but  
 

 
 
might be in years which is also not safe. Still majority using 
static  password  because  everybody 
is  not  computer  
professional  and  unaware  about  hacking  activities.  The 
static password problems have been deeply investigated  
beside that current problems solution used to login to cloud 
services have been  thoroughly investigated and monitored 
and  finalized  that  they  don’t  satisfy  the  needs  for  cloud 
service. Some systems are complicated some are costly and 
some  of  them  are  insecure.  The  main  weakness    static 
password is that if it is simple it can be easily attacked by 
Trojan attacks, password attacks, or by simply guessing it. 
A static password is the usual way that a user authenticate 
when log in to a service is needed. The password is usually 
a  secret  word  or  phrase  picked  by  the  user  and  used 
together  with  the  user's  username.  It  can  be  used  when 
logging  in  to  your  own  personal  computer,  an  e-mail 
system,  an  online  community  etc.  Even  though  static 
passwords is used almost everywhere, from a security point 
of view it has a lot of problems. The static password can be 
hacked  with  very  little  efforts  by  attackers  because  the 
attackers will not take care of time to decrypt the password 
and  people  confidential  information  will  get  hack  very 
easily by the unauthrised user.    
The  picture  below  shows  the  typical  example  of  static     
 password.

3.aTopaTwentyaPassword  
 
In  an  article  from  January  2010,  a  list  of  32  million 
passwords 
in  an  attack,  have  been 
examined.  The  number  one  most  popular  password 
used by  most users was 123456, and the top 32 password 
was all bad from a security point of view. The password list 
was further studied in a report from the security company 
Imperva.  In  that  report  it  is  stated  that  about  30%  of  the 
passwords  had  a  length  of  six  characters  or  below. 
Furthermore, 60% of the password only used a limited set 
of the most common characters and half the passwords on 
the list was based on names, slang, dictionary word or other 
forms of simple passwords. This shows a clear example on 
how static passwords can't meet today's security standards. 
The following picture shows the top 20 passwords from the 
password  list.  Table  captions  appear  centered  above  the 
table in upper and  lower case letters.  When referring  to  a 
table  in  the  text,  no  abbreviation  is  used  and  "Table"  is 
capitalized.

4.aWiresharkaPacketaCaptured 
This is very common nowadays hackers use the software’s 
to capture the password and people often don’t use SSL and 
encryption  therefore  it  become  very  easy  for  attackers  to 
captured packets from live traffic, the figure below shows 
the

             Figure 3: Wirshark Captured packets 
 
5.aOneaTimeapassword/Oneadayapassword  
One  time  password  is  best  solution  as  compare  to  static 
passwords    in  cloud  environment  because  in  this  method 
every time users get login but with the new password. The 
password get expire within two minutes but session will be 
activated but when users again login he/she will be given a 
new password so this cycle will continue, if hackers capture 
the  packets  and  decrypt  the  AES  encrypted  password  and 
user  Id    it  will  be  useless  because  password  get  change 
within  two  minutes.  Same  procedure  apply  on  one  day 
password  after  24  hours  password  get  change.    It  means 
that  this  application  can  be  used  in  both  situations  either 
packets are encrypted or not.   
A.  User Sign Up Process 
This new technique of user sign up has been added with the 
feature  of  OTP  and  ODP  by  which  the  users  can  decide 
uponatheiratypeaofatheausabilityaandatheasecurity.  
 
• A non frequent  user uses  OTP (one  time  password) and 
always  gets  the  new  password  for  each  access  and  hence 
providing 
access.  
• A frequent user go for ODP (One Day Password) so that 
the user need not change the password on. 
Means  that    according  to  users  designation,  level  of 
privileges are defined.     
 
6.aEncryptionaTechnique 
AES  has 
for 
in 
authentication  during  transmission.  AES  as  compare  to 
RSA, DSA, and RC4 is much better encryption technique 
because 
its  algorithm  fast  and  reliable.  We  have 
introduced OTP/ODP with the AES encryption these two 
security  factors  together  produce  firm  authentication 
results.  AES  is  very  fast  and  reliable  algorithm  which 
confirm the user authentication in a proper way.  
 
7.  Proposed Security Solutions 
There are ways to have a secure and easy-to-use cloud 
service that can satisfy these criteria’s:  
1.  Provide  better  password  solution  for  login  procedures

     than 
static  passwords.  
2.    Have  an  easy-to-understand    registration    system,  that   
     at  the  same  time  doesn't  compromise  the  security.  
3.  Use  an  encryption  algorithm  that  is  secure    but    also   
     fast, to be able to serve the vast amount of cloud users.       
4.  Offer  a  solution  that  is  free  of      charge  in  order  to   
     attract  more  customers 
services.  
5.  In  overall,  the  security  solution  for  cloud  services  
     must  be  easy  to  use,  but  also  be  very  secure  in  order   
     to  protect  the  customers'  data  and  gain  the  trust  of    
     the customers.  
 
8.aMemberaLoginaProcedure 
 
This is the first Screen when member will try to login into 
the system  but first the person will receive new password  
in the email then will get login permission. The user name 
will be the same as enter during registration but password 
will be changed within two minutes or 24 hours.  
 

permission otherwise the password will be issued.  
   
B. Additional Security Layer 
 Get password mechanism is very simple and easy again in 
this  screen  not  email  is  available  which  means  that  if 
hacker somehow  get the  user  token and  password  but  not 
be  sure  about  the  email  address,  this  technique  add 
additional security into the application. This application is 
very  secure  and  capable  to  secure  the  companies  or 
individual information  and data in  a  very efficient way  in 
cloud environment. 
 
10.aRegistrationaProcess 
 
The registration process is very simple which can use  by 
both  professional  and  new  user.  The  below  Screen  shows 
the registration process where users enter their details.

 9.aPostaScreenaMethod 
 
This  is  the  Post  Screen  the  user  will  enter  the  user  name 
and token and receive password via email, validity will be 
two minutes or one day after  specified time  the password 
will get expire.

12.aConclutionaandaFutureaWorks 
In this paper has looked at the current security situation in 
cloud computing. Proposed ways to securely and easy login 
to  a  cloud  service  using  one  time  password  and  one  day 
password  which 
the  user  use.  The  best  encryption 
algorithm  to  use  in  cloud  services,  with  regards  to  safety 
and speed, have been evaluated. The proposal ended up in a 
working solution that use OTP/ODP authentication for the 
login procedure, a very secure registration system and with 
all 
transmissions  encrypted  with  AES.  The 
implementation provides high security for the users while it 
is  still  easy  to  use.  It  provides  benefits  over  the  current 
security solutions for authentication that is used today. The 
big difference from solutions with static passwords is that 
the  passwords in this  solution are  only  valid for specified 
time limit only, which is big advantage in security.  Since 
cloud  services  is  used  by  millions  of  users,  the  security 
must be very good in order to protect private data, and also 
be fast, flexible and easy to use for all of the different users 
with  different  technology  skills.  For  future  work  the  time 
synchronization  between  the  email  and  server  should  be 
fixed.  It  should  be  also  investigated  if  it  is  needed  to 
implement a more secure algorithm.
