Abstract 
 
Cloud  computing  is  a  utilization  of  computer  resources  that  are  available  on  demand  and  accessed  via  a  network.  A 
cloud can be a private cloud or a public cloud. A public cloud mainly sells services to anyone on the Internet. A private 
cloud  is  actually  a  proprietary  network  or  a  data  center  that  supplies  hosted  services  to  a  limited  number  of  people. 
There  is  a  growing  trend  of  using  cloud  environments  for  ever  growing  storage  and  data  processing  needs.  But  still, 
adopting a cloud computing paradigm may have positive as well as negative effect on data security. Thus we focus on 
unique feature of the cloud which poses many new security challenges that need to be clearly understood and resolved. 
So  this  paper  will  explore  data  security  of  public  cloud  in  cloud  computing  by  implementing  digital  signature  and 
encryption with public key cryptography.

1. Introduction 
 
1 Cloud  computing  is  actually  one  of  today’s  hottest 
research areas due to its ability  to reduce costs associated 
with computing while increasing scalability and flexibility 
for computing services. 
 
What is cloud computing? 
 
Cloud computing is utilization of computer resources that 
are:  Available  on  demand,  Accessed  via  a  network, 
Charged  according  to  usage,  and  Provided  as  a  service 
from  a  cloud  vendor.  The  various  types  of  deployment 
model are:  
Public  cloud  -  In  this  the  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  people  or  a  large  industry 
group  and  provided  by  single  service  provider  selling 
cloud  services.  Public  cloud  services  may  be  free  or 
offered on a pay per usage model. Owned and maintained 
by the cloud provider. 
Private cloud - The cloud infrastructure is operated solely 
for an organization. The main advantage of using a private 
cloud is the security, compliance and QoS. Sometime it is 
risky  to  put  sensitive  data  outside  the  organization  and 
premises  on  a  public  cloud.  Owned  and  operated  by  user 
organization. 
Hybrid  cloud  -  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  a  combination 
of  two  or  more  clouds.  It  is  used  when  a  certain 
organization  is  not  willing  to  put  its  data  on  public  cloud 
but want to use the financial benefits of cloud data storage 

Contrary to traditional computing practices, in a cloud 
computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  are 
controlled by the  service  provider. This leads to a natural 
concern about the safety of the data and also its protection 
from  internal  as  well  as  external  threats.  Despite  of  all 
these  concerns,  advantages 
such  as  on  demand 
infrastructure, reduced cost of maintenance, pay as you go, 
elastic  scaling  etc.  are  major  reasons  for  enterprises  to 
decide  on  cloud  computing  environments.  Storing  of  user 
data  in  the  cloud  despite  its  advantages  has  many 
interesting security concerns which need to be extensively 
investigated  for  making  it  a  reliable  solution  to  the 
problem of avoiding local storage of data.  
     All  these  various  advantages  offered  by  the  cloud  can 
be enjoyed while using services offered by a private cloud 
by paying some charges but the same thing can be enjoyed 
by  using  a  public  cloud  at  the  least  cost  or  no  cost.  But 
using public cloud services also comes  with an additional 
threat regarding the security of data stored at public cloud. 
 
2. Security issues 
 
In  a  typical  scenario  where  an  application  is  hosted  in  a 
cloud, two broad security questions that arises are: 
– How secure is the Data? 
– How secure is the Code? 
Cloud  computing  environment  is  generally  assumed  as  a 
potential  cost  saver  as  well  as  provider  of  higher  service 
quality.  Security,  Availability,  Reliability,  Data  Integrity,  
Confidentiality,  Access  control,  Authentication  are  the 
major  quality  concerns  of  cloud  service  users.  In  one  of

at risk can range from loss of civil liberties to the contents 
of  bank  accounts.  For  a  business,  the  value  runs  from 
important trade secrets to continuity of business operations 
and  public  reputation.  Much  of  this  is  quite  hard  to 
estimate  and  translate  into  standard  metrics  of  value.  The 
task  in  this  transition  is  to  compare  the  opportunities  of 
cloud adoption with the risks associated with the same.  
     If cloud computing is so great, then why isn’t everyone 
doing it? Because the cloud act as a big black box nothing 
inside  the  cloud  is  visible  to  client  and  this  leads  to  two 
main issues that are : 
Integrity:  It  is  degree  of  confidence  that  the  data  in  the 
cloud  is  protected  against  accidential  or  intentional 
alteration  without  authorization.  Thus  it  implies  that  data 
should  be  honestly  stored  on  the  cloud  servers  and  any 
violation can be detected. 
Privacy: In this concept providers ensured that all critical 
data  example  credit  card  number  are  masked  and  only 
authorized  users  have  access  for  it.  In  2009  a  major 
incident  in  SAAS  cloud  happened  with  Google  Docs. 
Google  Docs  allows  users  to  edit  document  online  and 
share  these  documents  with  other  users.  But  once  these 
documents  shared  with  any  one  it  was  accessible  for 
everyone.  Thus  in  era  of  personal  privacy  personal  data 
should really protected. 
 
4. Literature Survey 
 
In  1990  the  world  was  introduced  to  the  internet  and  we 
began  to  see  distributed  computing  power  realized  on 
large  scale.  Today  we  have  the  ability  to  utilize  scalable 
distributed computing environment  within the confines of  
internet, such a practice is known as cloud computing. As 
we  already  know  there  is  lots  of  hype  associated  with 
cloud computing.

the  prominent  challenge  among  all  other  quality 
challenges. 
 
2.1 Security Advantages in Cloud Environments 
 
Current  cloud  service  providers  operate  very 
large 
systems.  They  have  complex  processes  and  expert 
personnel  for  maintaining  their  systems,  which  small 
enterprizes  may  not  even  have  an  access  to.  Due  to  this, 
there are  many direct and indirect security advantages for 
the cloud users. Here we present some of the main security 
advantages of a cloud computing environment: 
Data  Centralization:  In  a  cloud  environment,  the  cloud 
service  provider  takes  care  of  storage  issues  and  small 
businesses  need  not  spend  a  lot  of  money  on  physical 
devices  for  storage.  Also,  cloud  based  storage  provides  a 
way  to  centralize  the  data  in  a  faster  and  potentially 
cheaper  manner. This is particularly  very  useful  for small 
businesses,  which  cannot  spend  more  money  on  security 
parameters to secure the data. 
Incident  Response:  IaaS  providers  can  put  up  a  dedicated 
forensic server that can be used on demand basis. As soon 
as,  a  security  violation  takes  place,  server  can  be  brought 
online.  In  some  investigation  cases,  even  a  backup  of  the 
environment  can  be  easily  made  and  put  onto  the  cloud 
without affecting the normal course of business. 
Forensic  Image  Verification  Time:  Some  cloud  storage 
implementations  expose  a  cryptographic  check  sum  or 
hash. For example, Amazon S3 generates MD5 (Message-
Digest algorithm 5) hash automatically when you store an 
object.  Thus  in  theory,  the  need  to  generate  time 
consuming  MD5  checksums  using  external  tools  is 
eliminated. 
Logging:  In  a  traditional  computing  paradigm  by  and 
large,  logging  is  often  an  after  thought.  In  general, 
insufficient  disk  space  is  allocated  that  makes  logging 
either  non-existent  or  minimal.  However,  in  a  cloud, 
storage the need for standard logs is automatically solved. 
 
3. Problem Statement   
 
Cloud  security  is  becoming  a  key  differentiator  and 
competitive edge between cloud providers. So by applying 
the most strongest security techniques and practices, cloud 
security  may  soon  be  more  secure  than  the  level  that  IT 
departments  achieve  using 
their  own  hardware  and 
software. 
     A key hurdle to moving IT systems to the cloud is the 
lack of trust on the cloud provider. The cloud provider, in 
turn, also needs to enforce strict security policies, which in 
turn requires additional trust in the clients. To improve the 
mutual trust between consumer and cloud provider, a good 
trust foundation needs to be in place. Cloud computing can 
mean different things to different people. The privacy and 
security  concerns  will  surely  differ  between  a  consumer 
using a public cloud application,  medium-sized enterprise 
using  a  customized  suite  of  business  applications  on  a 
cloud platform, and a government agency  with a to cloud 
systems  brings  a  different  package  of  benefits  and  risks. 
What  remains  constant,  though,  is  the  real  value  that  the 
user seeks to protect. For an individual, the value which is

Hybrid  cloud  -  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  a  combination 
of  two  or  more  clouds.  It  is  used  when  a  certain

trust foundation needs to be in place. Cloud computing can 
mean different things to different people. The privacy and 
security  concerns  will  surely  differ  between  a  consumer

Abstract 
 
Cloud  computing  is  a  utilization  of  computer  resources  that  are  available  on  demand  and  accessed  via  a  network.  A 
cloud can be a private cloud or a public cloud. A public cloud mainly sells services to anyone on the Internet. A private 
cloud  is  actually  a  proprietary  network  or  a  data  center  that  supplies  hosted  services  to  a  limited  number  of  people. 
There  is  a  growing  trend  of  using  cloud  environments  for  ever  growing  storage  and  data  processing  needs.  But  still, 
adopting a cloud computing paradigm may have positive as well as negative effect on data security. Thus we focus on 
unique feature of the cloud which poses many new security challenges that need to be clearly understood and resolved. 
So  this  paper  will  explore  data  security  of  public  cloud  in  cloud  computing  by  implementing  digital  signature  and 
encryption with public key cryptography. 
 
Keywords: Cryptography, Encryption, Decryption, Digital Signature, Message Digest. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1 Cloud  computing  is  actually  one  of  today’s  hottest 
research areas due to its ability  to reduce costs associated 
with computing while increasing scalability and flexibility 
for computing services. 
 
What is cloud computing? 
 
Cloud computing is utilization of computer resources that 
are:  Available  on  demand,  Accessed  via  a  network, 
Charged  according  to  usage,  and  Provided  as  a  service 
from  a  cloud  vendor.  The  various  types  of  deployment 
model are:  
Public  cloud  -  In  this  the  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  people  or  a  large  industry 
group  and  provided  by  single  service  provider  selling 
cloud  services.  Public  cloud  services  may  be  free  or 
offered on a pay per usage model. Owned and maintained 
by the cloud provider. 
Private cloud - The cloud infrastructure is operated solely 
for an organization. The main advantage of using a private 
cloud is the security, compliance and QoS. Sometime it is 
risky  to  put  sensitive  data  outside  the  organization  and 
premises  on  a  public  cloud.  Owned  and  operated  by  user 
organization. 
Hybrid  cloud  -  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  a  combination 
of  two  or  more  clouds.  It  is  used  when  a  certain 
organization  is  not  willing  to  put  its  data  on  public  cloud 
but want to use the financial benefits of cloud data storage 

Contrary to traditional computing practices, in a cloud 
computing  environment,  data  and  the  application  are 
controlled by the  service  provider. This leads to a natural 
concern about the safety of the data and also its protection 
from  internal  as  well  as  external  threats.  Despite  of  all 
these  concerns,  advantages 
such  as  on  demand 
infrastructure, reduced cost of maintenance, pay as you go, 
elastic  scaling  etc.  are  major  reasons  for  enterprises  to 
decide  on  cloud  computing  environments.  Storing  of  user 
data  in  the  cloud  despite  its  advantages  has  many 
interesting security concerns which need to be extensively 
investigated  for  making  it  a  reliable  solution  to  the 
problem of avoiding local storage of data.  
     All  these  various  advantages  offered  by  the  cloud  can 
be enjoyed while using services offered by a private cloud 
by paying some charges but the same thing can be enjoyed 
by  using  a  public  cloud  at  the  least  cost  or  no  cost.  But 
using public cloud services also comes  with an additional 
threat regarding the security of data stored at public cloud. 
 
2. Security issues 
 
In  a  typical  scenario  where  an  application  is  hosted  in  a 
cloud, two broad security questions that arises are: 
– How secure is the Data? 
– How secure is the Code? 
Cloud  computing  environment  is  generally  assumed  as  a 
potential  cost  saver  as  well  as  provider  of  higher  service 
quality.  Security,  Availability,  Reliability,  Data  Integrity,  
Confidentiality,  Access  control,  Authentication  are  the 
major  quality  concerns  of  cloud  service  users.  In  one  of

at risk can range from loss of civil liberties to the contents 
of  bank  accounts.  For  a  business,  the  value  runs  from 
important trade secrets to continuity of business operations 
and  public  reputation.  Much  of  this  is  quite  hard  to 
estimate  and  translate  into  standard  metrics  of  value.  The 
task  in  this  transition  is  to  compare  the  opportunities  of 
cloud adoption with the risks associated with the same.  
     If cloud computing is so great, then why isn’t everyone 
doing it? Because the cloud act as a big black box nothing 
inside  the  cloud  is  visible  to  client  and  this  leads  to  two 
main issues that are : 
Integrity:  It  is  degree  of  confidence  that  the  data  in  the 
cloud  is  protected  against  accidential  or  intentional 
alteration  without  authorization.  Thus  it  implies  that  data 
should  be  honestly  stored  on  the  cloud  servers  and  any 
violation can be detected. 
Privacy: In this concept providers ensured that all critical 
data  example  credit  card  number  are  masked  and  only 
authorized  users  have  access  for  it.  In  2009  a  major 
incident  in  SAAS  cloud  happened  with  Google  Docs. 
Google  Docs  allows  users  to  edit  document  online  and 
share  these  documents  with  other  users.  But  once  these 
documents  shared  with  any  one  it  was  accessible  for 
everyone.  Thus  in  era  of  personal  privacy  personal  data 
should really protected. 
 
4. Literature Survey 
 
In  1990  the  world  was  introduced  to  the  internet  and  we 
began  to  see  distributed  computing  power  realized  on 
large  scale.  Today  we  have  the  ability  to  utilize  scalable 
distributed computing environment  within the confines of  
internet, such a practice is known as cloud computing. As 
we  already  know  there  is  lots  of  hype  associated  with 
cloud computing.

the  prominent  challenge  among  all  other  quality 
challenges. 
 
2.1 Security Advantages in Cloud Environments 
 
Current  cloud  service  providers  operate  very 
large 
systems.  They  have  complex  processes  and  expert 
personnel  for  maintaining  their  systems,  which  small 
enterprizes  may  not  even  have  an  access  to.  Due  to  this, 
there are  many direct and indirect security advantages for 
the cloud users. Here we present some of the main security 
advantages of a cloud computing environment: 
Data  Centralization:  In  a  cloud  environment,  the  cloud 
service  provider  takes  care  of  storage  issues  and  small 
businesses  need  not  spend  a  lot  of  money  on  physical 
devices  for  storage.  Also,  cloud  based  storage  provides  a 
way  to  centralize  the  data  in  a  faster  and  potentially 
cheaper  manner. This is particularly  very  useful  for small 
businesses,  which  cannot  spend  more  money  on  security 
parameters to secure the data. 
Incident  Response:  IaaS  providers  can  put  up  a  dedicated 
forensic server that can be used on demand basis. As soon 
as,  a  security  violation  takes  place,  server  can  be  brought 
online.  In  some  investigation  cases,  even  a  backup  of  the 
environment  can  be  easily  made  and  put  onto  the  cloud 
without affecting the normal course of business. 
Forensic  Image  Verification  Time:  Some  cloud  storage 
implementations  expose  a  cryptographic  check  sum  or 
hash. For example, Amazon S3 generates MD5 (Message-
Digest algorithm 5) hash automatically when you store an 
object.  Thus  in  theory,  the  need  to  generate  time 
consuming  MD5  checksums  using  external  tools  is 
eliminated. 
Logging:  In  a  traditional  computing  paradigm  by  and 
large,  logging  is  often  an  after  thought.  In  general, 
insufficient  disk  space  is  allocated  that  makes  logging 
either  non-existent  or  minimal.  However,  in  a  cloud, 
storage the need for standard logs is automatically solved. 
 
3. Problem Statement   
 
Cloud  security  is  becoming  a  key  differentiator  and 
competitive edge between cloud providers. So by applying 
the most strongest security techniques and practices, cloud 
security  may  soon  be  more  secure  than  the  level  that  IT 
departments  achieve  using 
their  own  hardware  and 
software. 
     A key hurdle to moving IT systems to the cloud is the 
lack of trust on the cloud provider. The cloud provider, in 
turn, also needs to enforce strict security policies, which in 
turn requires additional trust in the clients. To improve the 
mutual trust between consumer and cloud provider, a good 
trust foundation needs to be in place. Cloud computing can 
mean different things to different people. The privacy and 
security  concerns  will  surely  differ  between  a  consumer 
using a public cloud application,  medium-sized enterprise 
using  a  customized  suite  of  business  applications  on  a 
cloud platform, and a government agency  with a to cloud 
systems  brings  a  different  package  of  benefits  and  risks. 
What  remains  constant,  though,  is  the  real  value  that  the 
user seeks to protect. For an individual, the value which is

5.2 Online Exam Application 
 
The  attacks  which  can  be  happen  in  Online  Exam 
application are 
 
5.1  Attacks  on  question-  Now  If  candidate  is  giving  an 
online exam and the questions that the candidate is getting 
are from public cloud. So there can be a middle man attack 
where  the  attacker  can  access  those  question  and  he  can 
change  those  question.  Like  if  the  attacker  is  in  favor  of 
that candidate, then he can change those difficult question 
into an easier one or vice a versa can also happen. 
5.2 Attack on answer- Attacker can also change the answer 
that the candidate is submitting to the server. Attacker can 
change  the  wrong  answer  into  correct  answer  and  correct 
answer to wrong answer. 
5.3 Server Crash- Also it may happen that server may get 
crash.  So  we  are  storing  our  application  in  cloud  and  we 
are  providing  security  to  it  by  using  encryption  and 
decryption algorithm. 
     So instead of using a traditional way of storing the data, 
we are creating a replica of our data. So even if server may 
get  crash,  then  also  data  is  available  to  us  at  any  time  on 
demand. And we are providing security that is maintaining 
integrity and privacy of our Online Exam application from 
all 
these  attack  by  applying  encryption  decryption 
algorithm. 
 
Secure data transfer from Cloud to Cloud 
 
Let us assume that we have two organizations A and B. A 
and  B  act  as  public  clouds  with  data,  software  and 
applications.  A  want  to  send  data  to  B’s  cloud  securely 
and data should be authenticated.   
 

storage  and  then  apply  the  hash  function,  it  will  give 
message  digest.  Sign  the  message  digest  with  his  private 
key  by  using  A’s  software.  It  is  called  digital  signature. 
Encrypt  digitally  signed  signature  with  B’s  public  key  . 
Encrypted cipher message will be send to B. B’s software 
decrypt  the  cipher  message  to  XML  document  with  his 
private key and verify the signature with A’s public key. 
 
 
Future scope 
 
Our  main  aim  is  to  provide  security.  The  algorithms  we 
have  used  will give better privacy. So this can be used in 
any  other  applications  which  are  stored  on  public  cloud. 
Thus we are providing security to public cloud against the 
various  types  of  possible  attacks.  This  is  helpful  in 
Banking  applications,  Storing  criminal  data,  for  Hospital 
records etc. In the same way even the ERP system for any 
system could be placed on public cloud.  
  
Conclusions 
 
Thus  we  have  provided  security  to  our  application  which 
is  stored  on  public  cloud,  by  using  security  techniques 
such  as  Message  Digest,  Encryption,  Decryption,  Hash 
function.  Thus  we  have  successfully  maintained  the 
integrity,  privacy and confidentiality of our data stored on 
public cloud.

Figure 5.3: Data Transfer 
 
We  are  here  trying  to  send  a  secure  data  from  A  to  B  by 
applying digital signature and data encryption. Suppose B 
wants  an  XML  document  from  A’s  cloud  then  B’s  user 
will  place  a  request  to  A’s  user.  A’s  user  select 
corresponding XML   document  
 from A’s  cloud    data
