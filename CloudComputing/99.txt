Abstract—in cloud computing data storage is a significant issue
because  the entire  data reside  over a  set of  interconnected
resource pools that enables the data to  be accessed  through
virtual  machines.  It  moves  the  application  software’s  and
databases to the large data centers where the management of
data is actually done. As the resource pools are situated over
various  corners of  the world,  the management  of data  and
services may not  be fully  trustworthy. So,  there are  various
issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the
management of data, service of data, privacy of data, security
of  data etc.  But the  privacy and  security of  data is  highly
challenging. To ensure privacy and security of data-at-rest in
cloud computing, we  have proposed an effective  and a  novel
approach to ensure data security in cloud computing by means
of  hiding data  within  images  following is  the concept  of
steganography. The main objective of this paper is to prevent
data access  from cloud data storage centers by unauthorized
users. This scheme perfectly stores data at cloud data storage
centers and retrieves data from it when  it is needed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing  is  defined  as a  model  for  enabling
ubiquitous,  convenient,  cheapest,  on-demand  network
access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g. networks, servers, storage devices and services) that
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal
management effort or service provider interaction [1]. In such
an environment users need not own the infrastructure for
various computing services. In fact they can be accessed
their data from any computer from any part of the world. It
can  allocate  or  reallocate resources  dynamically with  an
ability to continuously monitor their performance [1]. It is
now a challenging way where we can share data, information,
and knowledge. The benefits of cloud computing are many.
One is reduced cost, since you pay as you go. The ultimate
goal  is  allowing  customer  to  run  their  everyday  IT
infrastructure in cloud.

In the cloud computing many services are provided to
the client by the cloud. Storing of data is the main features
that  the  cloud  service  provider  provides  to  the  client
companies or  any other  users. They can store their huge
amount  of data  in cloud  data  storage  centers. But  many

clients  are  not  ready  to  implement  cloud  computing
technology due to the lack of proper security control policy
and weakness  in protection  of data which  leads  to  a  big
challenge for the cloud computing providers. The pioneer of
cloud computing vendors, Amazon Simple Storage Services
(S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [2] are well
known example. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services
interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount
of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It also allows
developer to access the highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast,
inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network web services.

From the viewpoint of data security which has been an
important  aspect of  quality  of  services,  cloud  computing
unavoidably poses  new  challenging  security  threats  for
number of reasons. Firstly, we cannot adopt the traditional
cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security in
cloud computing as the user’ loss their data control. So, we
need  a  data  verification  strategy  but  without  explicit
knowledge of the whole data, it is very hard to verify the
correct data. Considering various kinds of data for each user,
stored in the cloud and demand of the long term continuous
assurance  of  their  data  safety,  the  problem  of  verifying
correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more
challenging.  Secondly,  it  is  not  a  just  third-party  data
warehouse. The data stored in the cloud may be frequently
updated  by  the  user,  including  insertion,  deletion,
modification, appending, recovering, etc. So, for this dynamic
operation, it needs to be more advanced technology to prevent
data loss from the cloud   data storage centers. Last but not
the  least  data centers  are running  in  a  simultaneously,
cooperated and in distributed manner [3]. Every user’ data is
stored in multiple physical locations randomly. Therefore
distributed protocols for storage correctness assurance will
be most importance in achieving a robust and secure cloud
data storage system in the real word.

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible data
hiding scheme with explicit dynamic data support to ensure
the security of data when it is residing in the cloud data
storage. We enhanced the security of data to store it into an
image. When these images are stored in the cloud data centre,
no one can view the original content of the data without any
proper identification.  Our scheme  almost guarantees  the

provides platform oriented services, besides providing the
environment for software execution. It aims to protect data in
storage.   It  delivers  platforms, tools  and other  business
services that enable customer to develop, deploy, and mange
their own application, without installing any of these platforms
and support tools on their local machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is the topmost layer which
features  a  complete  application  offered  as  a  service  on
demand.  It  deliver  application  hosted  on  the  cloud
infrastructure as internet based service for end user without
requiring  installing  the  application  on  the  customer’s
computers.  It  ensures  that the  complete  applications  are
hosted on the internet and users use them.

Cloud  computing  can  be  broadly  classified  in  two
categories, the service delivery models and the deployment
models [1]. The deployment models are: 1) Private cloud: a
cloud platform is dedicated for specific organizations; all of
these services are deployed through a privately owned data
center used exclusively by the organization that builds it.
These private clouds may deploy proprietary technologies
inaccessible to other users of the cloud services, 2) Public
cloud: a cloud platform available to public user to register
and use the available infrastructure.  Multiple enterprises
can work on the same infrastructure, at the same time. User
can dynamically provision recourses through the internet
from an off-site service provider, 3) Hybrid cloud: a private
cloud that can extend to use resources in public clouds. It
focuses to create an environment in which an organization
provides  and manages  some resources  in-house  and  has
others  provided  externally. It  combines public  cloud  and
private cloud data center principles, it’s possible to plan a
hybrid cloud deployment from either of these starting points
and 4) Community Cloud: a community cloud in computing
is  a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared
between several organizations from a specific community with
common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.),
whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted
internally or externally. Public clouds are the most vulnerable
deployment model because they are available for public users
to host their services, they may be malicious users.

The service delivery model is organized into three layers,
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the lowest layer that
provides the basic infrastructure as a support. It basically
refers to the sharing of the hardware resources for executing
services, typically including virtualization technology. The
cloud consumer has the provision for processing, storage,
networks  etc  and  to  deploy  and  run  arbitrary  software
supported by the operating system run by the virtual machine.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the middle layer which

Figure  1:  Cloud  service delivery model

Each  service  delivery  model  has  different  possible
implementations,  as  in  Figure 1,  which  complicates  the
development  of standard  security model  for each  service
delivery model. Moreover, these service delivery models may
coexist  in  one  cloud platform  the  security  management
process.

It  is clear that the security  issue has played  the most
important role in hindering cloud computing acceptance.
Without doubt, putting your data, running your software on
someone else’s hard disk using someone else’s CPU appears
daunting to many. Well-known security issues such as data
loss, phishing, and botnet (running remotely on a collection
of machines) pose serious threats to organization’s data and
software. Moreover, the multi-tenancy model and the pooled
computing resources in cloud computing has introduced new
security challenges that require novel techniques to tackle
with. For example, hackers can use cloud to organize botnet
as cloud often provides more reliable infrastructure services
at a relatively cheaper price for them to start an attack [4].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing  data-at-rest  plays  a  crucial  role  in  cloud
computing.  The  main  issue  with  data-at-rest  in  cloud
computing is loss of control; even an unauthorized user may
have access the data in a shared environment. However, now-
a-days  storage  devices  are  powered  by  encryption
methodologies which restrict unauthorized access to data to
share extents. If the encryption and

decryption  keys  are  accessible  to  malicious  users
encryption methodologies fails to provide authorized access.
Another approach to provide security in data-at-rest is to
hide  data  behind  images,  following  the  concept  of
stenography. This paper aims to provide a better security
through  steganography.

A. System Architecture

Schematic network architecture for our proposed model
for  cloud  data storage  is  illustrated  in Figure  2. In  this
architecture, we have different network entities which can be
identified as follows:

Figure-3 shows whole file is partitioned into three parts
and data within each portion is saved into the corresponding
images. The number of images would be varying depending
on the size of data files. The partitioning of a file depends on
the size of images and the contents of the file.

Figure  3:  Mapping  from  Data  into  Images

The security model shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 give a
detailed description of how the system will be worked. The
users will perform their computations in CSP-3. Whenever
user wants to save their data, the following operation will be
happen:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images from CSP-1.
2. CSP-1 acknowledges CSP-3 by providing a set of

3. CSP-3 requests the data hiding algorithm which is

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5. According to the algorithm the data are saved within
the pixels of the images which are taken from the
CSP-1.

6.    The images containing the data will be stored in CSP-

which  have  significant  resources  of  grayscale  image  of
various  sizes, a  database  which maintains records  of file
names, number of characters present etc.
Cloud Service Provider-2(CSP-2): Another cloud service
provider, which stores a mechanism or algorithm for data
hiding within images and retrieving data from images.
Cloud Service Provider 3(CSP-3): Another Cloud Service
which is connected to CSP-1 and CSP-2. All the computations
that will be carried out by the user, will take place in CSP-3.
According to the requirement, CSP-3 will interact with CSP-1
and CSP-2.
B. Security Model

Our proposed model aims to secure data-at-rest, not by
physically storing files, instead of the data present in a files
are somehow stored within some images. This underlining
concept is known as steganography which tells- “The art
and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that
no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient,
suspects the existence of  the message, a form of security
through obscurity”.

issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the
management of data, service of data, privacy of data, security
of  data etc.  But the  privacy and  security of  data is  highly
challenging. To ensure privacy and security of data-at-rest in
cloud computing, we  have proposed an effective  and a  novel
approach to ensure data security in cloud computing by means
of  hiding data  within  images  following is  the concept  of
steganography. The main objective of this paper is to prevent
data access  from cloud data storage centers by unauthorized
users. This scheme perfectly stores data at cloud data storage
centers and retrieves data from it when  it is needed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing  is  defined  as a  model  for  enabling
ubiquitous,  convenient,  cheapest,  on-demand  network
access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g. networks, servers, storage devices and services) that
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal
management effort or service provider interaction [1]. In such
an environment users need not own the infrastructure for
various computing services. In fact they can be accessed
their data from any computer from any part of the world. It
can  allocate  or  reallocate resources  dynamically with  an
ability to continuously monitor their performance [1]. It is
now a challenging way where we can share data, information,
and knowledge. The benefits of cloud computing are many.
One is reduced cost, since you pay as you go. The ultimate
goal  is  allowing  customer  to  run  their  everyday  IT
infrastructure in cloud.

In the cloud computing many services are provided to
the client by the cloud. Storing of data is the main features
that  the  cloud  service  provider  provides  to  the  client
companies or  any other  users. They can store their huge
amount  of data  in cloud  data  storage  centers. But  many

clients  are  not  ready  to  implement  cloud  computing
technology due to the lack of proper security control policy
and weakness  in protection  of data which  leads  to  a  big
challenge for the cloud computing providers. The pioneer of
cloud computing vendors, Amazon Simple Storage Services
(S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [2] are well
known example. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services
interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount
of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It also allows
developer to access the highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast,
inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network web services.

From the viewpoint of data security which has been an
important  aspect of  quality  of  services,  cloud  computing
unavoidably poses  new  challenging  security  threats  for
number of reasons. Firstly, we cannot adopt the traditional
cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security in
cloud computing as the user’ loss their data control. So, we
need  a  data  verification  strategy  but  without  explicit
knowledge of the whole data, it is very hard to verify the
correct data. Considering various kinds of data for each user,
stored in the cloud and demand of the long term continuous
assurance  of  their  data  safety,  the  problem  of  verifying
correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more
challenging.  Secondly,  it  is  not  a  just  third-party  data
warehouse. The data stored in the cloud may be frequently
updated  by  the  user,  including  insertion,  deletion,
modification, appending, recovering, etc. So, for this dynamic
operation, it needs to be more advanced technology to prevent
data loss from the cloud   data storage centers. Last but not
the  least  data centers  are running  in  a  simultaneously,
cooperated and in distributed manner [3]. Every user’ data is
stored in multiple physical locations randomly. Therefore
distributed protocols for storage correctness assurance will
be most importance in achieving a robust and secure cloud
data storage system in the real word.

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible data
hiding scheme with explicit dynamic data support to ensure
the security of data when it is residing in the cloud data
storage. We enhanced the security of data to store it into an
image. When these images are stored in the cloud data centre,
no one can view the original content of the data without any
proper identification.  Our scheme  almost guarantees  the
security of data when it is residing on the data center of any

Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

According to our survey, our work is debutant in this
field to store data in data storage centers in the form of im-
ages. Our contribution summarized as the following aspects:
1) Compared to many of its predecessors, which only store
data in raw format, but in our scheme we are storing data into
images, and 2) this new scheme support secure and efficient
data storage and retrieval operation. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the cloud
architecture and security issues. Section III introduces the
system  architecture,  security  model, our design  goal  and
notations. Then we provide the detailed description of our
scheme in Section IV. Section V gives the security analysis
and performance evaluations, followed by Section VI over-
views the related work. Finally, we give the concluding re-
marks of the whole paper and future scope in Section VII.

provides platform oriented services, besides providing the
environment for software execution. It aims to protect data in
storage.   It  delivers  platforms, tools  and other  business
services that enable customer to develop, deploy, and mange
their own application, without installing any of these platforms
and support tools on their local machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is the topmost layer which
features  a  complete  application  offered  as  a  service  on
demand.  It  deliver  application  hosted  on  the  cloud
infrastructure as internet based service for end user without
requiring  installing  the  application  on  the  customer’s
computers.  It  ensures  that the  complete  applications  are
hosted on the internet and users use them.

Cloud  computing  can  be  broadly  classified  in  two
categories, the service delivery models and the deployment
models [1]. The deployment models are: 1) Private cloud: a
cloud platform is dedicated for specific organizations; all of
these services are deployed through a privately owned data
center used exclusively by the organization that builds it.
These private clouds may deploy proprietary technologies
inaccessible to other users of the cloud services, 2) Public
cloud: a cloud platform available to public user to register
and use the available infrastructure.  Multiple enterprises
can work on the same infrastructure, at the same time. User
can dynamically provision recourses through the internet
from an off-site service provider, 3) Hybrid cloud: a private
cloud that can extend to use resources in public clouds. It
focuses to create an environment in which an organization
provides  and manages  some resources  in-house  and  has
others  provided  externally. It  combines public  cloud  and
private cloud data center principles, it’s possible to plan a
hybrid cloud deployment from either of these starting points
and 4) Community Cloud: a community cloud in computing
is  a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared
between several organizations from a specific community with
common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.),
whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted
internally or externally. Public clouds are the most vulnerable
deployment model because they are available for public users
to host their services, they may be malicious users.

The service delivery model is organized into three layers,
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the lowest layer that
provides the basic infrastructure as a support. It basically
refers to the sharing of the hardware resources for executing
services, typically including virtualization technology. The
cloud consumer has the provision for processing, storage,
networks  etc  and  to  deploy  and  run  arbitrary  software
supported by the operating system run by the virtual machine.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the middle layer which

Figure  1:  Cloud  service delivery model

Each  service  delivery  model  has  different  possible
implementations,  as  in  Figure 1,  which  complicates  the
development  of standard  security model  for each  service
delivery model. Moreover, these service delivery models may
coexist  in  one  cloud platform  the  security  management
process.

It  is clear that the security  issue has played  the most
important role in hindering cloud computing acceptance.
Without doubt, putting your data, running your software on
someone else’s hard disk using someone else’s CPU appears
daunting to many. Well-known security issues such as data
loss, phishing, and botnet (running remotely on a collection
of machines) pose serious threats to organization’s data and
software. Moreover, the multi-tenancy model and the pooled
computing resources in cloud computing has introduced new
security challenges that require novel techniques to tackle
with. For example, hackers can use cloud to organize botnet
as cloud often provides more reliable infrastructure services
at a relatively cheaper price for them to start an attack [4].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing  data-at-rest  plays  a  crucial  role  in  cloud
computing.  The  main  issue  with  data-at-rest  in  cloud
computing is loss of control; even an unauthorized user may
have access the data in a shared environment. However, now-
a-days  storage  devices  are  powered  by  encryption
methodologies which restrict unauthorized access to data to
share extents. If the encryption and

decryption  keys  are  accessible  to  malicious  users
encryption methodologies fails to provide authorized access.
Another approach to provide security in data-at-rest is to
hide  data  behind  images,  following  the  concept  of
stenography. This paper aims to provide a better security
through  steganography.

A. System Architecture

Schematic network architecture for our proposed model
for  cloud  data storage  is  illustrated  in Figure  2. In  this
architecture, we have different network entities which can be
identified as follows:

Figure-3 shows whole file is partitioned into three parts
and data within each portion is saved into the corresponding
images. The number of images would be varying depending
on the size of data files. The partitioning of a file depends on
the size of images and the contents of the file.

Figure  3:  Mapping  from  Data  into  Images

The security model shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 give a
detailed description of how the system will be worked. The
users will perform their computations in CSP-3. Whenever
user wants to save their data, the following operation will be
happen:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images from CSP-1.
2. CSP-1 acknowledges CSP-3 by providing a set of

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5. According to the algorithm the data are saved within
the pixels of the images which are taken from the
CSP-1.

various  sizes, a  database  which maintains records  of file
names, number of characters present etc.

provider, which stores a mechanism or algorithm for data
hiding within images and retrieving data from images.
Cloud Service Provider 3(CSP-3): Another Cloud Service
which is connected to CSP-1 and CSP-2. All the computations
that will be carried out by the user, will take place in CSP-3.
According to the requirement, CSP-3 will interact with CSP-1
and CSP-2.
B. Security Model

Our proposed model aims to secure data-at-rest, not by
physically storing files, instead of the data present in a files
are somehow stored within some images. This underlining
concept is known as steganography which tells- “The art
and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that
no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient,
suspects the existence of  the message, a form of security
through obscurity”.

Later whenever user wants to view or retrieve his/her

data the following mechanisms will be followed:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images which are associated

with the file that users want to view/retrieve.

2. CSP-1 acknowledges  to  CSP-3 by  providing  the

associated set of images.

3. CSP-3 requests the data retrieval algorithm which is

stored in CSP-2.

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5.     CSP-3 processes the algorithm on the images which
are provided  by  CSP-1,  and  store  the data  after
retrieval into a temporary file. This file is displayed
to the user and after any operation on this data; it
will be deleted from it.

Figure  5:  Processing  model  to  Retrieve  Data

Before user log-out from CSP-3, the temporary file will be

automatically de-allocated from the system.
C. Design Goal

To  ensure  the  security  for  cloud  data  storage  from
unauthorized users, we have designed efficient mechanism
for data-at-rest in cloud data storage centers. As our used
techniques highlights hiding data within digital image, this
steganography technique exploits the weakness of Human
Visual System (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in
luminance of grayscale vectors at higher frequency side of
the visual spectrum. An image is a collection of pixels (Picture
Elements), where each pixel of grayscale image is composed
of 8 bits. If we change the last bit, the color information may
be varying within +1 to -1. This change of the intensity will
not  be  perceived  by  human  eye.  Now  data  consist  of
characters representing ASCII values. Our idea is to store
each character into the last bit of consecutive 8 pixels. So by
storing data within images, which are located in remote cloud
servers, we can achieve the following goals.
Correctness: Data can be stored correctly within images.
Availability: An authorized user can retrieve the information
from an image when required.
 Protection: It is fully protected from  unauthorized user
because, perceiving an image does not provide any idea of
the original information.

that the users initially perform their computation in a text file.
This file will be de-allocated after storing data into images.

available in CSP-2.

IV. ENHANCING CLOUD DATA STORAGE

In cloud computing user store and process their data in
the cloud, no longer posses the data locally. Thus security of
data that are stored on the distributed cloud server must be
guaranteed. The major security concern regarding cloud com-
puting is that, if data is residing in remote servers when it is
available in raw format, and then it can be easily accessible
and manipulated by unauthorized users. So, our main scheme
for ensuring data security in cloud storage signifies to trans-
form data in such a way, such that it can’t be traced by unau-
thorized users. Now, we  are  outlining the  methodologies
which we have implemented.
A. Creation of Image Database

We  have  created  a  database  consisting  of images  of
different sizes which is located in CSP-1. Whenever a user
wants to store data, a set of images will be selected from this

Abstract—in cloud computing data storage is a significant issue
because  the entire  data reside  over a  set of  interconnected
resource pools that enables the data to  be accessed  through
virtual  machines.  It  moves  the  application  software’s  and
databases to the large data centers where the management of
data is actually done. As the resource pools are situated over
various  corners of  the world,  the management  of data  and
services may not  be fully  trustworthy. So,  there are  various
issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the
management of data, service of data, privacy of data, security
of  data etc.  But the  privacy and  security of  data is  highly
challenging. To ensure privacy and security of data-at-rest in
cloud computing, we  have proposed an effective  and a  novel
approach to ensure data security in cloud computing by means
of  hiding data  within  images  following is  the concept  of
steganography. The main objective of this paper is to prevent
data access  from cloud data storage centers by unauthorized
users. This scheme perfectly stores data at cloud data storage

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing  is  defined  as a  model  for  enabling
ubiquitous,  convenient,  cheapest,  on-demand  network
access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g. networks, servers, storage devices and services) that
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal
management effort or service provider interaction [1]. In such
an environment users need not own the infrastructure for
various computing services. In fact they can be accessed
their data from any computer from any part of the world. It
can  allocate  or  reallocate resources  dynamically with  an
ability to continuously monitor their performance [1]. It is
now a challenging way where we can share data, information,
and knowledge. The benefits of cloud computing are many.
One is reduced cost, since you pay as you go. The ultimate
goal  is  allowing  customer  to  run  their  everyday  IT
infrastructure in cloud.

In the cloud computing many services are provided to
the client by the cloud. Storing of data is the main features
that  the  cloud  service  provider  provides  to  the  client
companies or  any other  users. They can store their huge
amount  of data  in cloud  data  storage  centers. But  many

clients  are  not  ready  to  implement  cloud  computing
technology due to the lack of proper security control policy
and weakness  in protection  of data which  leads  to  a  big
challenge for the cloud computing providers. The pioneer of
cloud computing vendors, Amazon Simple Storage Services
(S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [2] are well
known example. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services
interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount
of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It also allows
developer to access the highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast,
inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network web services.

From the viewpoint of data security which has been an
important  aspect of  quality  of  services,  cloud  computing
unavoidably poses  new  challenging  security  threats  for
number of reasons. Firstly, we cannot adopt the traditional
cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security in
cloud computing as the user’ loss their data control. So, we
need  a  data  verification  strategy  but  without  explicit
knowledge of the whole data, it is very hard to verify the
correct data. Considering various kinds of data for each user,
stored in the cloud and demand of the long term continuous
assurance  of  their  data  safety,  the  problem  of  verifying
correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more
challenging.  Secondly,  it  is  not  a  just  third-party  data
warehouse. The data stored in the cloud may be frequently
updated  by  the  user,  including  insertion,  deletion,
modification, appending, recovering, etc. So, for this dynamic
operation, it needs to be more advanced technology to prevent
data loss from the cloud   data storage centers. Last but not
the  least  data centers  are running  in  a  simultaneously,
cooperated and in distributed manner [3]. Every user’ data is
stored in multiple physical locations randomly. Therefore
distributed protocols for storage correctness assurance will
be most importance in achieving a robust and secure cloud
data storage system in the real word.

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible data
hiding scheme with explicit dynamic data support to ensure
the security of data when it is residing in the cloud data
storage. We enhanced the security of data to store it into an
image. When these images are stored in the cloud data centre,
no one can view the original content of the data without any
proper identification.  Our scheme  almost guarantees  the
security of data when it is residing on the data center of any

Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

According to our survey, our work is debutant in this
field to store data in data storage centers in the form of im-
ages. Our contribution summarized as the following aspects:
1) Compared to many of its predecessors, which only store
data in raw format, but in our scheme we are storing data into
images, and 2) this new scheme support secure and efficient
data storage and retrieval operation. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the cloud
architecture and security issues. Section III introduces the
system  architecture,  security  model, our design  goal  and
notations. Then we provide the detailed description of our
scheme in Section IV. Section V gives the security analysis
and performance evaluations, followed by Section VI over-
views the related work. Finally, we give the concluding re-
marks of the whole paper and future scope in Section VII.

provides platform oriented services, besides providing the
environment for software execution. It aims to protect data in
storage.   It  delivers  platforms, tools  and other  business
services that enable customer to develop, deploy, and mange
their own application, without installing any of these platforms
and support tools on their local machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is the topmost layer which
features  a  complete  application  offered  as  a  service  on
demand.  It  deliver  application  hosted  on  the  cloud
infrastructure as internet based service for end user without
requiring  installing  the  application  on  the  customer’s
computers.  It  ensures  that the  complete  applications  are
hosted on the internet and users use them.

Cloud  computing  can  be  broadly  classified  in  two
categories, the service delivery models and the deployment
models [1]. The deployment models are: 1) Private cloud: a
cloud platform is dedicated for specific organizations; all of
these services are deployed through a privately owned data
center used exclusively by the organization that builds it.
These private clouds may deploy proprietary technologies
inaccessible to other users of the cloud services, 2) Public
cloud: a cloud platform available to public user to register
and use the available infrastructure.  Multiple enterprises
can work on the same infrastructure, at the same time. User
can dynamically provision recourses through the internet
from an off-site service provider, 3) Hybrid cloud: a private
cloud that can extend to use resources in public clouds. It
focuses to create an environment in which an organization
provides  and manages  some resources  in-house  and  has
others  provided  externally. It  combines public  cloud  and
private cloud data center principles, it’s possible to plan a
hybrid cloud deployment from either of these starting points
and 4) Community Cloud: a community cloud in computing
is  a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared
between several organizations from a specific community with
common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.),
whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted
internally or externally. Public clouds are the most vulnerable
deployment model because they are available for public users
to host their services, they may be malicious users.

The service delivery model is organized into three layers,
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the lowest layer that
provides the basic infrastructure as a support. It basically
refers to the sharing of the hardware resources for executing
services, typically including virtualization technology. The
cloud consumer has the provision for processing, storage,
networks  etc  and  to  deploy  and  run  arbitrary  software
supported by the operating system run by the virtual machine.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the middle layer which

Figure  1:  Cloud  service delivery model

Each  service  delivery  model  has  different  possible
implementations,  as  in  Figure 1,  which  complicates  the
development  of standard  security model  for each  service
delivery model. Moreover, these service delivery models may
coexist  in  one  cloud platform  the  security  management
process.

It  is clear that the security  issue has played  the most
important role in hindering cloud computing acceptance.
Without doubt, putting your data, running your software on
someone else’s hard disk using someone else’s CPU appears
daunting to many. Well-known security issues such as data
loss, phishing, and botnet (running remotely on a collection
of machines) pose serious threats to organization’s data and
software. Moreover, the multi-tenancy model and the pooled
computing resources in cloud computing has introduced new
security challenges that require novel techniques to tackle
with. For example, hackers can use cloud to organize botnet
as cloud often provides more reliable infrastructure services
at a relatively cheaper price for them to start an attack [4].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing  data-at-rest  plays  a  crucial  role  in  cloud
computing.  The  main  issue  with  data-at-rest  in  cloud
computing is loss of control; even an unauthorized user may
have access the data in a shared environment. However, now-
a-days  storage  devices  are  powered  by  encryption
methodologies which restrict unauthorized access to data to
share extents. If the encryption and

decryption  keys  are  accessible  to  malicious  users
encryption methodologies fails to provide authorized access.
Another approach to provide security in data-at-rest is to
hide  data  behind  images,  following  the  concept  of
stenography. This paper aims to provide a better security
through  steganography.

A. System Architecture

Schematic network architecture for our proposed model
for  cloud  data storage  is  illustrated  in Figure  2. In  this
architecture, we have different network entities which can be
identified as follows:

Figure-3 shows whole file is partitioned into three parts
and data within each portion is saved into the corresponding
images. The number of images would be varying depending
on the size of data files. The partitioning of a file depends on
the size of images and the contents of the file.

The security model shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 give a
detailed description of how the system will be worked. The
users will perform their computations in CSP-3. Whenever
user wants to save their data, the following operation will be
happen:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images from CSP-1.

Our proposed model aims to secure data-at-rest, not by
physically storing files, instead of the data present in a files
are somehow stored within some images. This underlining
concept is known as steganography which tells- “The art
and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that
no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient,
suspects the existence of  the message, a form of security
through obscurity”.

Later whenever user wants to view or retrieve his/her

data the following mechanisms will be followed:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images which are associated

with the file that users want to view/retrieve.

2. CSP-1 acknowledges  to  CSP-3 by  providing  the

associated set of images.

3. CSP-3 requests the data retrieval algorithm which is

stored in CSP-2.

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5.     CSP-3 processes the algorithm on the images which
are provided  by  CSP-1,  and  store  the data  after
retrieval into a temporary file. This file is displayed
to the user and after any operation on this data; it
will be deleted from it.

Before user log-out from CSP-3, the temporary file will be

automatically de-allocated from the system.
C. Design Goal

To  ensure  the  security  for  cloud  data  storage  from
unauthorized users, we have designed efficient mechanism
for data-at-rest in cloud data storage centers. As our used
techniques highlights hiding data within digital image, this
steganography technique exploits the weakness of Human
Visual System (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in
luminance of grayscale vectors at higher frequency side of
the visual spectrum. An image is a collection of pixels (Picture
Elements), where each pixel of grayscale image is composed
of 8 bits. If we change the last bit, the color information may
be varying within +1 to -1. This change of the intensity will
not  be  perceived  by  human  eye.  Now  data  consist  of
characters representing ASCII values. Our idea is to store
each character into the last bit of consecutive 8 pixels. So by
storing data within images, which are located in remote cloud
servers, we can achieve the following goals.
Correctness: Data can be stored correctly within images.
Availability: An authorized user can retrieve the information
from an image when required.
 Protection: It is fully protected from  unauthorized user
because, perceiving an image does not provide any idea of
the original information.

that the users initially perform their computation in a text file.
This file will be de-allocated after storing data into images.

operation and will be de-allocated automatically after use.
CCount: Number of characters present in a file.

ImgSearch ().
Img_Index1: A temporary image address.

the various images to store different consecutive parts of a
file.
File_Database: It is a file which signifies on which set of
images our data is stored, which is also available in CSP-1.
An obvious misconception may arise that the file database
contains the actual information, but it is not true. It actually
maintains following attributes:
a. Name of file
b. CCount of file.

associated with each file.

available in CSP-2.

IV. ENHANCING CLOUD DATA STORAGE

In cloud computing user store and process their data in
the cloud, no longer posses the data locally. Thus security of
data that are stored on the distributed cloud server must be
guaranteed. The major security concern regarding cloud com-
puting is that, if data is residing in remote servers when it is
available in raw format, and then it can be easily accessible
and manipulated by unauthorized users. So, our main scheme
for ensuring data security in cloud storage signifies to trans-
form data in such a way, such that it can’t be traced by unau-
thorized users. Now, we  are  outlining the  methodologies
which we have implemented.
A. Creation of Image Database

We  have  created  a  database  consisting  of images  of
different sizes which is located in CSP-1. Whenever a user
wants to store data, a set of images will be selected from this

Full Paper

database and it will be transferred to CSP-3 and all operation
will be occurred in CSP-3.
B. Maintenance of File Database

An obvious misconception may be arisen that the file
database contains the actual information, but it is not true. It
is a file which signifies that on which set of images our data
is stored.
C. Hiding Data within Images

This portion deals with the pre-requisite requirements for
the steganographic operations which includes a table where
attributes  like name  of  file  to  be  saved, total  characters
presents, address of images etc are  present. This  process
runs in CSP-3, whenever user wants to store a file.
Algorithm 1: Hiding Data within Images

1: procedure
2:       Select F;
3:       Compute CCount from F;
4:       Load Img_Index = ImgSearch (Img_Database);
5:       Store File_Database (File_Name,
          CCount, Img_Index);
6:       MdfImage (Img_Database [Img_Index]);
7: end procedure.

D. Searching of Image

Here, we have shown how an image can be selected for
performing steganographic operations. It will search a valid
image and eventually returns the address of the same.
Algorithm 2: ImgSearch ()

1: procedure
2:       Open Image_Database;
3:       for Img_Database (i), i?1, n do
4:              if (Img_Database (i).valid==1)
5:                     return i;
6:              end if
7:       end for
8: end procedure

E. Mapping Data from a File to Image

This mechanism helps us to store raw data within images.
This algorithm also dynamically selects a new image using
algorithm 2, whenever an image is overflowed with data.
Algorithm 3: MdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read Img_Database [Img_Index];
3:        Compute PixelCount for Img_Database
           [Img_Index];
4:        Open F;
5:        while (Read Characters until EOF) do
6:                if (PixelCount < CCount)
7:                     Compute ASCII value;
8:                     Store each bits of ASCII into consecutive
                     8 pixels of the Img_Database
                     [Img_Index];
9:                else

10:                     Load Img_Index
                          1=ImgSearch (Img_Database);
11:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=
                          Img_Index 1;

12:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=0;
13:                end if
14:        end while
15: end procedure

F. Retrieving Data from Image

When an authorized user wants to view data which are
already stored in remote cloud servers within images, the
following mechanism helps us to retrieve data into human
readable format.
Algorithm 4: RdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read F;
3:        for File_Database (i), i?1, m do
4:                if (F exits)
5:                      I=Addres of image associated with F;
6:                end if
7:        end for
8:        Open Img_Database;
9:        Read Image_Database [I];
10:        Open an FTemp;
11:        while (Until all characters are within in FTemp) do
12:                k=Convert A8 to Character
13:                write k into FTemp;
14:         end while
15: end procedure

V. SEQUIRITY ANALISIS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we analyze our proposed model in terms
of security and efficiency. Our security analysis focuses on
the system architecture and its security model defined in
section II. We also evaluate the efficiency of our scheme via
implementing the file database and image database.
A. Security Strength Against CSP-1

As in CSP-1, we are storing only set of files which contains
only the address of valid images (i.e. those which have some
information). We have also stored here the set of images
which can store the information when the user wants to store
the data. So, when the images contain the information, an
unauthorized user cannot perceive anything by viewing these
images.
B. Security Strength Against CSP-2

In CSP-2, we are storing only the retrieving and hiding
mechanism which we will need at the time of viewing and
storing the data from CSP-3. So there is nothing to fear from
an unauthorized user.
C. Security Strength Against CSP-3

In our proposed model, we have chosen this CSP-3 for

Abstract—in cloud computing data storage is a significant issue
because  the entire  data reside  over a  set of  interconnected
resource pools that enables the data to  be accessed  through
virtual  machines.  It  moves  the  application  software’s  and
databases to the large data centers where the management of
data is actually done. As the resource pools are situated over
various  corners of  the world,  the management  of data  and
services may not  be fully  trustworthy. So,  there are  various
issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the
management of data, service of data, privacy of data, security
of  data etc.  But the  privacy and  security of  data is  highly
challenging. To ensure privacy and security of data-at-rest in
cloud computing, we  have proposed an effective  and a  novel
approach to ensure data security in cloud computing by means
of  hiding data  within  images  following is  the concept  of
steganography. The main objective of this paper is to prevent
data access  from cloud data storage centers by unauthorized
users. This scheme perfectly stores data at cloud data storage
centers and retrieves data from it when  it is needed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing  is  defined  as a  model  for  enabling
ubiquitous,  convenient,  cheapest,  on-demand  network
access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g. networks, servers, storage devices and services) that
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal
management effort or service provider interaction [1]. In such
an environment users need not own the infrastructure for
various computing services. In fact they can be accessed
their data from any computer from any part of the world. It
can  allocate  or  reallocate resources  dynamically with  an
ability to continuously monitor their performance [1]. It is
now a challenging way where we can share data, information,
and knowledge. The benefits of cloud computing are many.
One is reduced cost, since you pay as you go. The ultimate
goal  is  allowing  customer  to  run  their  everyday  IT
infrastructure in cloud.

In the cloud computing many services are provided to
the client by the cloud. Storing of data is the main features
that  the  cloud  service  provider  provides  to  the  client
companies or  any other  users. They can store their huge
amount  of data  in cloud  data  storage  centers. But  many

clients  are  not  ready  to  implement  cloud  computing
technology due to the lack of proper security control policy
and weakness  in protection  of data which  leads  to  a  big
challenge for the cloud computing providers. The pioneer of
cloud computing vendors, Amazon Simple Storage Services
(S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [2] are well
known example. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services
interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount
of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It also allows
developer to access the highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast,
inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network web services.

From the viewpoint of data security which has been an
important  aspect of  quality  of  services,  cloud  computing
unavoidably poses  new  challenging  security  threats  for
number of reasons. Firstly, we cannot adopt the traditional
cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security in
cloud computing as the user’ loss their data control. So, we
need  a  data  verification  strategy  but  without  explicit
knowledge of the whole data, it is very hard to verify the
correct data. Considering various kinds of data for each user,
stored in the cloud and demand of the long term continuous
assurance  of  their  data  safety,  the  problem  of  verifying
correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more
challenging.  Secondly,  it  is  not  a  just  third-party  data
warehouse. The data stored in the cloud may be frequently
updated  by  the  user,  including  insertion,  deletion,
modification, appending, recovering, etc. So, for this dynamic
operation, it needs to be more advanced technology to prevent
data loss from the cloud   data storage centers. Last but not
the  least  data centers  are running  in  a  simultaneously,
cooperated and in distributed manner [3]. Every user’ data is
stored in multiple physical locations randomly. Therefore
distributed protocols for storage correctness assurance will
be most importance in achieving a robust and secure cloud
data storage system in the real word.

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible data
hiding scheme with explicit dynamic data support to ensure
the security of data when it is residing in the cloud data
storage. We enhanced the security of data to store it into an
image. When these images are stored in the cloud data centre,
no one can view the original content of the data without any
proper identification.  Our scheme  almost guarantees  the
security of data when it is residing on the data center of any

Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

According to our survey, our work is debutant in this
field to store data in data storage centers in the form of im-
ages. Our contribution summarized as the following aspects:
1) Compared to many of its predecessors, which only store
data in raw format, but in our scheme we are storing data into
images, and 2) this new scheme support secure and efficient
data storage and retrieval operation. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the cloud
architecture and security issues. Section III introduces the
system  architecture,  security  model, our design  goal  and
notations. Then we provide the detailed description of our
scheme in Section IV. Section V gives the security analysis
and performance evaluations, followed by Section VI over-
views the related work. Finally, we give the concluding re-
marks of the whole paper and future scope in Section VII.

provides platform oriented services, besides providing the
environment for software execution. It aims to protect data in
storage.   It  delivers  platforms, tools  and other  business
services that enable customer to develop, deploy, and mange
their own application, without installing any of these platforms
and support tools on their local machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is the topmost layer which
features  a  complete  application  offered  as  a  service  on
demand.  It  deliver  application  hosted  on  the  cloud
infrastructure as internet based service for end user without
requiring  installing  the  application  on  the  customer’s
computers.  It  ensures  that the  complete  applications  are
hosted on the internet and users use them.

Cloud  computing  can  be  broadly  classified  in  two
categories, the service delivery models and the deployment
models [1]. The deployment models are: 1) Private cloud: a
cloud platform is dedicated for specific organizations; all of
these services are deployed through a privately owned data
center used exclusively by the organization that builds it.
These private clouds may deploy proprietary technologies
inaccessible to other users of the cloud services, 2) Public
cloud: a cloud platform available to public user to register
and use the available infrastructure.  Multiple enterprises
can work on the same infrastructure, at the same time. User
can dynamically provision recourses through the internet
from an off-site service provider, 3) Hybrid cloud: a private
cloud that can extend to use resources in public clouds. It
focuses to create an environment in which an organization
provides  and manages  some resources  in-house  and  has
others  provided  externally. It  combines public  cloud  and
private cloud data center principles, it’s possible to plan a
hybrid cloud deployment from either of these starting points
and 4) Community Cloud: a community cloud in computing
is  a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared
between several organizations from a specific community with
common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.),
whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted
internally or externally. Public clouds are the most vulnerable
deployment model because they are available for public users
to host their services, they may be malicious users.

The service delivery model is organized into three layers,
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the lowest layer that
provides the basic infrastructure as a support. It basically
refers to the sharing of the hardware resources for executing
services, typically including virtualization technology. The
cloud consumer has the provision for processing, storage,
networks  etc  and  to  deploy  and  run  arbitrary  software
supported by the operating system run by the virtual machine.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the middle layer which

Figure  1:  Cloud  service delivery model

Each  service  delivery  model  has  different  possible
implementations,  as  in  Figure 1,  which  complicates  the
development  of standard  security model  for each  service
delivery model. Moreover, these service delivery models may
coexist  in  one  cloud platform  the  security  management
process.

It  is clear that the security  issue has played  the most
important role in hindering cloud computing acceptance.
Without doubt, putting your data, running your software on
someone else’s hard disk using someone else’s CPU appears
daunting to many. Well-known security issues such as data
loss, phishing, and botnet (running remotely on a collection
of machines) pose serious threats to organization’s data and
software. Moreover, the multi-tenancy model and the pooled
computing resources in cloud computing has introduced new
security challenges that require novel techniques to tackle
with. For example, hackers can use cloud to organize botnet
as cloud often provides more reliable infrastructure services
at a relatively cheaper price for them to start an attack [4].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing  data-at-rest  plays  a  crucial  role  in  cloud
computing.  The  main  issue  with  data-at-rest  in  cloud
computing is loss of control; even an unauthorized user may
have access the data in a shared environment. However, now-
a-days  storage  devices  are  powered  by  encryption
methodologies which restrict unauthorized access to data to
share extents. If the encryption and

decryption  keys  are  accessible  to  malicious  users
encryption methodologies fails to provide authorized access.
Another approach to provide security in data-at-rest is to
hide  data  behind  images,  following  the  concept  of
stenography. This paper aims to provide a better security
through  steganography.

A. System Architecture

Schematic network architecture for our proposed model
for  cloud  data storage  is  illustrated  in Figure  2. In  this
architecture, we have different network entities which can be
identified as follows:

Figure-3 shows whole file is partitioned into three parts
and data within each portion is saved into the corresponding
images. The number of images would be varying depending
on the size of data files. The partitioning of a file depends on
the size of images and the contents of the file.

Figure  3:  Mapping  from  Data  into  Images

The security model shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 give a
detailed description of how the system will be worked. The
users will perform their computations in CSP-3. Whenever
user wants to save their data, the following operation will be
happen:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images from CSP-1.
2. CSP-1 acknowledges CSP-3 by providing a set of

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5. According to the algorithm the data are saved within
the pixels of the images which are taken from the
CSP-1.

physically storing files, instead of the data present in a files

concept is known as steganography which tells- “The art

Later whenever user wants to view or retrieve his/her

data the following mechanisms will be followed:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images which are associated

with the file that users want to view/retrieve.

2. CSP-1 acknowledges  to  CSP-3 by  providing  the

associated set of images.

3. CSP-3 requests the data retrieval algorithm which is

stored in CSP-2.

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5.     CSP-3 processes the algorithm on the images which
are provided  by  CSP-1,  and  store  the data  after
retrieval into a temporary file. This file is displayed
to the user and after any operation on this data; it
will be deleted from it.

Figure  5:  Processing  model  to  Retrieve  Data

Before user log-out from CSP-3, the temporary file will be

automatically de-allocated from the system.
C. Design Goal

To  ensure  the  security  for  cloud  data  storage  from
unauthorized users, we have designed efficient mechanism
for data-at-rest in cloud data storage centers. As our used
techniques highlights hiding data within digital image, this
steganography technique exploits the weakness of Human
Visual System (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in
luminance of grayscale vectors at higher frequency side of
the visual spectrum. An image is a collection of pixels (Picture
Elements), where each pixel of grayscale image is composed
of 8 bits. If we change the last bit, the color information may
be varying within +1 to -1. This change of the intensity will
not  be  perceived  by  human  eye.  Now  data  consist  of
characters representing ASCII values. Our idea is to store
each character into the last bit of consecutive 8 pixels. So by
storing data within images, which are located in remote cloud
servers, we can achieve the following goals.
Correctness: Data can be stored correctly within images.
Availability: An authorized user can retrieve the information
from an image when required.
 Protection: It is fully protected from  unauthorized user
because, perceiving an image does not provide any idea of
the original information.

An obvious misconception may be arisen that the file
database contains the actual information, but it is not true. It
is a file which signifies that on which set of images our data
is stored.
C. Hiding Data within Images

This portion deals with the pre-requisite requirements for
the steganographic operations which includes a table where
attributes  like name  of  file  to  be  saved, total  characters
presents, address of images etc are  present. This  process
runs in CSP-3, whenever user wants to store a file.
Algorithm 1: Hiding Data within Images

1: procedure
2:       Select F;
3:       Compute CCount from F;
4:       Load Img_Index = ImgSearch (Img_Database);
5:       Store File_Database (File_Name,
          CCount, Img_Index);
6:       MdfImage (Img_Database [Img_Index]);
7: end procedure.

D. Searching of Image

Here, we have shown how an image can be selected for
performing steganographic operations. It will search a valid
image and eventually returns the address of the same.
Algorithm 2: ImgSearch ()

1: procedure
2:       Open Image_Database;
3:       for Img_Database (i), i?1, n do
4:              if (Img_Database (i).valid==1)
5:                     return i;
6:              end if
7:       end for
8: end procedure

E. Mapping Data from a File to Image

This mechanism helps us to store raw data within images.
This algorithm also dynamically selects a new image using
algorithm 2, whenever an image is overflowed with data.
Algorithm 3: MdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read Img_Database [Img_Index];
3:        Compute PixelCount for Img_Database
           [Img_Index];
4:        Open F;
5:        while (Read Characters until EOF) do
6:                if (PixelCount < CCount)
7:                     Compute ASCII value;
8:                     Store each bits of ASCII into consecutive
                     8 pixels of the Img_Database
                     [Img_Index];
9:                else

10:                     Load Img_Index
                          1=ImgSearch (Img_Database);
11:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=
                          Img_Index 1;

12:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=0;
13:                end if
14:        end while
15: end procedure

F. Retrieving Data from Image

When an authorized user wants to view data which are
already stored in remote cloud servers within images, the
following mechanism helps us to retrieve data into human
readable format.
Algorithm 4: RdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read F;
3:        for File_Database (i), i?1, m do
4:                if (F exits)
5:                      I=Addres of image associated with F;
6:                end if
7:        end for
8:        Open Img_Database;
9:        Read Image_Database [I];
10:        Open an FTemp;
11:        while (Until all characters are within in FTemp) do
12:                k=Convert A8 to Character
13:                write k into FTemp;
14:         end while
15: end procedure

V. SEQUIRITY ANALISIS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we analyze our proposed model in terms
of security and efficiency. Our security analysis focuses on
the system architecture and its security model defined in
section II. We also evaluate the efficiency of our scheme via
implementing the file database and image database.
A. Security Strength Against CSP-1

As in CSP-1, we are storing only set of files which contains
only the address of valid images (i.e. those which have some
information). We have also stored here the set of images
which can store the information when the user wants to store
the data. So, when the images contain the information, an
unauthorized user cannot perceive anything by viewing these
images.
B. Security Strength Against CSP-2

In CSP-2, we are storing only the retrieving and hiding
mechanism which we will need at the time of viewing and
storing the data from CSP-3. So there is nothing to fear from
an unauthorized user.
C. Security Strength Against CSP-3

In our proposed model, we have chosen this CSP-3 for

Full Paper

computational purpose for any operation i.e. storing data
within  images  and  retrieving  data  from  images. After
performing the operation all the files are automatically de-
allocated from this service provider.
D. Performance Evaluation

We  implemented our  approach  using  the  concept  of
steganography. Our experiment is conducted using MATLAB
R2012b on a system with Intel(R) Pentium (CPU) running at
2.60 GHz, 2048 MB of RAM, a 7200RPM Western Digital 500
GB Serial ATA drive with an 8MB buffer. It has been found
that our implemented system successfully stores data within
images and retrieves data from images.

VI. RELATED WORK

Shacham et al. [5] built on this model and constructed a
random linear function based homomorphic authenticator
which enables unlimited number of queries and requires less
communication  overhead. Bowers  et al.  [7] proposed  an
improved framework for POR protocols that generalizes both
Juels and Shacham’s work. Later in their subsequent work,
Bowers et al. [6] extended POR model to distributed systems.
However, all these schemes are focusing on static data. The
effectiveness  of  their  schemes  rests  primarily  on  the
preprocessing  steps  that  the  user  conducts  before
outsourcing the data file F. Any change to the contents of F,
even few bits, must propagate through the error-correcting
code,  thus  introducing  significant  computation  and
communication  complexity.  Cong  Wang  et  al.  [3]  use
homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-
coded  data  towards  ensuring  data  storage  security  and
locating  the  server  being  attacked.  It  support  dynamic
operation on data blocks such as update, delete and append
without data corruption and loss. However, the issues with
fine-grained data error location remain to be addressed.

In other related work, Shantanu pal et al. [8] ensures the
identification of adversary or the attacking party and helping
us find a far off place for an attacking party from its target
and hence ensuring a more secure environment for the other
VMs. If the adversary gets to know the location of the other
VMs, it may try to attack them. This may harm the other VMs
in between. Flavio Lombardi et al. [9] show that behavior of
cloud components can be monitored by logging and periodic
checking of executable system file. But system performance
gets marginally degraded and small performance penalty is
encountered. Filho et al. [9] proposed to verify data integrity
using RSA-based  hash  to  demonstrate  escheatable  data
possession in peer to peer file sharing networks. However,
their proposal requires exponentiation over the entire data
file, which is clearly impractical for the server whenever the
file is large. Shah et al. [10] proposed allowing a TPA to keep
online  storage  honest  by  first  encrypting  the data  then
sending a number of pre computed symmetric-keyed hashes
over the encrypted data to the auditor. However, their scheme
only works for encrypted files and auditors must maintain
long-term state. Schwarz et al. [11] proposed to ensure file
integrity across multiple distributed servers, using erasure-

coding and block-level file integrity checks.

Ateniese  et  al.  [12]  defined  the  “provable  data
possession” (PDP) model for ensuring possession of file on
untrusted storages. Their scheme utilized public key based
homomorphic tags for auditing the data file, thus providing
public verifiability. In their subsequent work, Ateniese et al.
[13] described a PDP scheme that uses only symmetric key
cryptography. This method has lower-overhead than their
previous scheme and allows for block updates, deletions and
appends to the stored file, which has also been supported in
our work. However, their scheme focuses on single server
scenario and does not address small data corruptions, leaving
both the distributed scenario and data error recovery issue
unexplored.  Curtmola  et  al.  [14]  aimed  to  ensure  data
possession of multiple replicas across the distributed storage
system. They extended the PDP scheme to cover multiple
replicas without encoding each replica separately, providing
guarantees that multiple copies of data are actually maintained.
However, we have proposed a new scheme to provide the

better security in the world of cloud computing.

VII. CONCLUION

In this paper, we have investigated the problem of security
in cloud computing, which is essentially a distributed storage
system. To ensure the security of user’ data in cloud storage,
we  proposed  an  effective  and  efficient  steganographic
strategy for enhancing security on data-at-rest. So, when
these images are stored in the cloud data centre, no one can
view the original content  of the data without any proper
identification. Through detailed security and performance
analysis, we have seen that our scheme almost guarantees
the security of data when it is residing on the data center of
any Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

The concept we have discussed here, will help to build a
strong  architecture  for  security  in  the  field  of  cloud
computation. This kind of structure of security will also be
able to improve customer satisfaction to a great extent and
we will  attract  more  investor  in  this  cloud  computation
concept for industrial as well as future research farms. Security
in a very large scale cross cloud environment is an active
issue. This present scheme is able to handle only a limited
number of security threats in a fairly small environment. We
need further simulations to verify the performance. In the
future, we will extend our research by providing security
through steganography in RGB images. Also, if the raw data
is  encrypted  and the steganographic issues are  employed
then the protection will be a bit enhanced. The protections
can also be enhanced if we can change the pixel positions
after steganography. Till now we are working on it to get
better performance.

Abstract—in cloud computing data storage is a significant issue
because  the entire  data reside  over a  set of  interconnected
resource pools that enables the data to  be accessed  through
virtual  machines.  It  moves  the  application  software’s  and
databases to the large data centers where the management of
data is actually done. As the resource pools are situated over
various  corners of  the world,  the management  of data  and
services may not  be fully  trustworthy. So,  there are  various
issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the
management of data, service of data, privacy of data, security
of  data etc.  But the  privacy and  security of  data is  highly
challenging. To ensure privacy and security of data-at-rest in
cloud computing, we  have proposed an effective  and a  novel
approach to ensure data security in cloud computing by means
of  hiding data  within  images  following is  the concept  of
steganography. The main objective of this paper is to prevent
data access  from cloud data storage centers by unauthorized
users. This scheme perfectly stores data at cloud data storage
centers and retrieves data from it when  it is needed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud computing  is  defined  as a  model  for  enabling
ubiquitous,  convenient,  cheapest,  on-demand  network
access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g. networks, servers, storage devices and services) that
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal
management effort or service provider interaction [1]. In such
an environment users need not own the infrastructure for
various computing services. In fact they can be accessed
their data from any computer from any part of the world. It
can  allocate  or  reallocate resources  dynamically with  an
ability to continuously monitor their performance [1]. It is
now a challenging way where we can share data, information,
and knowledge. The benefits of cloud computing are many.
One is reduced cost, since you pay as you go. The ultimate
goal  is  allowing  customer  to  run  their  everyday  IT
infrastructure in cloud.

In the cloud computing many services are provided to
the client by the cloud. Storing of data is the main features
that  the  cloud  service  provider  provides  to  the  client
companies or  any other  users. They can store their huge
amount  of data  in cloud  data  storage  centers. But  many

clients  are  not  ready  to  implement  cloud  computing
technology due to the lack of proper security control policy
and weakness  in protection  of data which  leads  to  a  big
challenge for the cloud computing providers. The pioneer of
cloud computing vendors, Amazon Simple Storage Services
(S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [2] are well
known example. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services
interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount
of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It also allows
developer to access the highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast,
inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network web services.

From the viewpoint of data security which has been an
important  aspect of  quality  of  services,  cloud  computing
unavoidably poses  new  challenging  security  threats  for
number of reasons. Firstly, we cannot adopt the traditional
cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security in
cloud computing as the user’ loss their data control. So, we
need  a  data  verification  strategy  but  without  explicit
knowledge of the whole data, it is very hard to verify the
correct data. Considering various kinds of data for each user,
stored in the cloud and demand of the long term continuous
assurance  of  their  data  safety,  the  problem  of  verifying
correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more
challenging.  Secondly,  it  is  not  a  just  third-party  data
warehouse. The data stored in the cloud may be frequently
updated  by  the  user,  including  insertion,  deletion,
modification, appending, recovering, etc. So, for this dynamic
operation, it needs to be more advanced technology to prevent
data loss from the cloud   data storage centers. Last but not
the  least  data centers  are running  in  a  simultaneously,
cooperated and in distributed manner [3]. Every user’ data is
stored in multiple physical locations randomly. Therefore
distributed protocols for storage correctness assurance will
be most importance in achieving a robust and secure cloud
data storage system in the real word.

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible data
hiding scheme with explicit dynamic data support to ensure
the security of data when it is residing in the cloud data
storage. We enhanced the security of data to store it into an
image. When these images are stored in the cloud data centre,
no one can view the original content of the data without any
proper identification.  Our scheme  almost guarantees  the
security of data when it is residing on the data center of any

Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

According to our survey, our work is debutant in this
field to store data in data storage centers in the form of im-
ages. Our contribution summarized as the following aspects:
1) Compared to many of its predecessors, which only store
data in raw format, but in our scheme we are storing data into
images, and 2) this new scheme support secure and efficient
data storage and retrieval operation. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the cloud
architecture and security issues. Section III introduces the
system  architecture,  security  model, our design  goal  and
notations. Then we provide the detailed description of our
scheme in Section IV. Section V gives the security analysis
and performance evaluations, followed by Section VI over-
views the related work. Finally, we give the concluding re-
marks of the whole paper and future scope in Section VII.

provides platform oriented services, besides providing the
environment for software execution. It aims to protect data in
storage.   It  delivers  platforms, tools  and other  business
services that enable customer to develop, deploy, and mange
their own application, without installing any of these platforms
and support tools on their local machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is the topmost layer which
features  a  complete  application  offered  as  a  service  on
demand.  It  deliver  application  hosted  on  the  cloud
infrastructure as internet based service for end user without
requiring  installing  the  application  on  the  customer’s
computers.  It  ensures  that the  complete  applications  are
hosted on the internet and users use them.

Cloud  computing  can  be  broadly  classified  in  two
categories, the service delivery models and the deployment
models [1]. The deployment models are: 1) Private cloud: a
cloud platform is dedicated for specific organizations; all of
these services are deployed through a privately owned data
center used exclusively by the organization that builds it.
These private clouds may deploy proprietary technologies
inaccessible to other users of the cloud services, 2) Public
cloud: a cloud platform available to public user to register
and use the available infrastructure.  Multiple enterprises
can work on the same infrastructure, at the same time. User
can dynamically provision recourses through the internet
from an off-site service provider, 3) Hybrid cloud: a private
cloud that can extend to use resources in public clouds. It
focuses to create an environment in which an organization
provides  and manages  some resources  in-house  and  has
others  provided  externally. It  combines public  cloud  and
private cloud data center principles, it’s possible to plan a
hybrid cloud deployment from either of these starting points
and 4) Community Cloud: a community cloud in computing
is  a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared
between several organizations from a specific community with
common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.),
whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted
internally or externally. Public clouds are the most vulnerable
deployment model because they are available for public users
to host their services, they may be malicious users.

The service delivery model is organized into three layers,
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the lowest layer that
provides the basic infrastructure as a support. It basically
refers to the sharing of the hardware resources for executing
services, typically including virtualization technology. The
cloud consumer has the provision for processing, storage,
networks  etc  and  to  deploy  and  run  arbitrary  software
supported by the operating system run by the virtual machine.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the middle layer which

Figure  1:  Cloud  service delivery model

Each  service  delivery  model  has  different  possible
implementations,  as  in  Figure 1,  which  complicates  the
development  of standard  security model  for each  service
delivery model. Moreover, these service delivery models may
coexist  in  one  cloud platform  the  security  management
process.

It  is clear that the security  issue has played  the most
important role in hindering cloud computing acceptance.
Without doubt, putting your data, running your software on
someone else’s hard disk using someone else’s CPU appears
daunting to many. Well-known security issues such as data
loss, phishing, and botnet (running remotely on a collection
of machines) pose serious threats to organization’s data and
software. Moreover, the multi-tenancy model and the pooled
computing resources in cloud computing has introduced new
security challenges that require novel techniques to tackle
with. For example, hackers can use cloud to organize botnet
as cloud often provides more reliable infrastructure services
at a relatively cheaper price for them to start an attack [4].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Managing  data-at-rest  plays  a  crucial  role  in  cloud
computing.  The  main  issue  with  data-at-rest  in  cloud
computing is loss of control; even an unauthorized user may
have access the data in a shared environment. However, now-
a-days  storage  devices  are  powered  by  encryption
methodologies which restrict unauthorized access to data to
share extents. If the encryption and

decryption  keys  are  accessible  to  malicious  users
encryption methodologies fails to provide authorized access.
Another approach to provide security in data-at-rest is to
hide  data  behind  images,  following  the  concept  of
stenography. This paper aims to provide a better security
through  steganography.

A. System Architecture

Schematic network architecture for our proposed model
for  cloud  data storage  is  illustrated  in Figure  2. In  this
architecture, we have different network entities which can be
identified as follows:

Figure-3 shows whole file is partitioned into three parts
and data within each portion is saved into the corresponding
images. The number of images would be varying depending
on the size of data files. The partitioning of a file depends on
the size of images and the contents of the file.

Figure  3:  Mapping  from  Data  into  Images

The security model shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 give a
detailed description of how the system will be worked. The
users will perform their computations in CSP-3. Whenever
user wants to save their data, the following operation will be
happen:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images from CSP-1.
2. CSP-1 acknowledges CSP-3 by providing a set of

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5. According to the algorithm the data are saved within
the pixels of the images which are taken from the
CSP-1.

6.    The images containing the data will be stored in CSP-

valid images.

stored in CSP-2.

User: Users or organizations who have their data for storage
in the cloud and rely on the cloud for data computation.
Cloud Service Provider-1(CSP-1): A cloud service provider
which  have  significant  resources  of  grayscale  image  of
various  sizes, a  database  which maintains records  of file
names, number of characters present etc.
Cloud Service Provider-2(CSP-2): Another cloud service
provider, which stores a mechanism or algorithm for data
hiding within images and retrieving data from images.
Cloud Service Provider 3(CSP-3): Another Cloud Service
which is connected to CSP-1 and CSP-2. All the computations
that will be carried out by the user, will take place in CSP-3.
According to the requirement, CSP-3 will interact with CSP-1
and CSP-2.
B. Security Model

Our proposed model aims to secure data-at-rest, not by
physically storing files, instead of the data present in a files
are somehow stored within some images. This underlining
concept is known as steganography which tells- “The art
and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that
no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient,
suspects the existence of  the message, a form of security
through obscurity”.

Later whenever user wants to view or retrieve his/her

data the following mechanisms will be followed:

1. CSP-3 requests set of images which are associated

with the file that users want to view/retrieve.

2. CSP-1 acknowledges  to  CSP-3 by  providing  the

associated set of images.

3. CSP-3 requests the data retrieval algorithm which is

stored in CSP-2.

4. CSP-2 provides the algorithm to CSP-3.
5.     CSP-3 processes the algorithm on the images which
are provided  by  CSP-1,  and  store  the data  after
retrieval into a temporary file. This file is displayed
to the user and after any operation on this data; it
will be deleted from it.

Figure  5:  Processing  model  to  Retrieve  Data

Before user log-out from CSP-3, the temporary file will be

automatically de-allocated from the system.
C. Design Goal

To  ensure  the  security  for  cloud  data  storage  from
unauthorized users, we have designed efficient mechanism
for data-at-rest in cloud data storage centers. As our used
techniques highlights hiding data within digital image, this
steganography technique exploits the weakness of Human
Visual System (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in
luminance of grayscale vectors at higher frequency side of
the visual spectrum. An image is a collection of pixels (Picture
Elements), where each pixel of grayscale image is composed
of 8 bits. If we change the last bit, the color information may
be varying within +1 to -1. This change of the intensity will
not  be  perceived  by  human  eye.  Now  data  consist  of
characters representing ASCII values. Our idea is to store
each character into the last bit of consecutive 8 pixels. So by
storing data within images, which are located in remote cloud
servers, we can achieve the following goals.
Correctness: Data can be stored correctly within images.
Availability: An authorized user can retrieve the information
from an image when required.
 Protection: It is fully protected from  unauthorized user
because, perceiving an image does not provide any idea of
the original information.

D. Notation and Preliminaries
F: The data file to be stored in the cloud. We are assuming
that the users initially perform their computation in a text file.
This file will be de-allocated after storing data into images.
FTemp: It is a temporary file which is used during data retrieval
operation and will be de-allocated automatically after use.
CCount: Number of characters present in a file.
PixelCount: Number of pixel present in an image.
A8: Accumulate 8 bits from the last bits of each pixel.
File_Name: The name of the file where user had performed
computation.
Img_Index:  The address  of a  valid  image returned  by
ImgSearch ().
Img_Index1: A temporary image address.

sizes which is available in CSP-1, here each images consists
the following attributes:

data or not.
c. Address field, which represents the connectivity among
the various images to store different consecutive parts of a
file.
File_Database: It is a file which signifies on which set of
images our data is stored, which is also available in CSP-1.
An obvious misconception may arise that the file database
contains the actual information, but it is not true. It actually
maintains following attributes:
a. Name of file
b. CCount of file.
c. Address field,  which represents  the  address  of images
associated with each file.
ImgSearch (): It searches for a valid image for storing data
& returns the address of the valid image if available.
MdfImage (): It maps data into images. It is available in CSP

RdfImage (): It retrieves original data from an image and it is
available in CSP-2.

IV. ENHANCING CLOUD DATA STORAGE

In cloud computing user store and process their data in
the cloud, no longer posses the data locally. Thus security of
data that are stored on the distributed cloud server must be
guaranteed. The major security concern regarding cloud com-
puting is that, if data is residing in remote servers when it is
available in raw format, and then it can be easily accessible
and manipulated by unauthorized users. So, our main scheme
for ensuring data security in cloud storage signifies to trans-
form data in such a way, such that it can’t be traced by unau-
thorized users. Now, we  are  outlining the  methodologies
which we have implemented.
A. Creation of Image Database

We  have  created  a  database  consisting  of images  of
different sizes which is located in CSP-1. Whenever a user

database and it will be transferred to CSP-3 and all operation
will be occurred in CSP-3.
B. Maintenance of File Database

An obvious misconception may be arisen that the file
database contains the actual information, but it is not true. It
is a file which signifies that on which set of images our data
is stored.
C. Hiding Data within Images

This portion deals with the pre-requisite requirements for
the steganographic operations which includes a table where
attributes  like name  of  file  to  be  saved, total  characters
presents, address of images etc are  present. This  process
runs in CSP-3, whenever user wants to store a file.
Algorithm 1: Hiding Data within Images

1: procedure
2:       Select F;
3:       Compute CCount from F;
4:       Load Img_Index = ImgSearch (Img_Database);
5:       Store File_Database (File_Name,
          CCount, Img_Index);
6:       MdfImage (Img_Database [Img_Index]);
7: end procedure.

D. Searching of Image

Here, we have shown how an image can be selected for
performing steganographic operations. It will search a valid
image and eventually returns the address of the same.
Algorithm 2: ImgSearch ()

1: procedure
2:       Open Image_Database;
3:       for Img_Database (i), i?1, n do
4:              if (Img_Database (i).valid==1)
5:                     return i;
6:              end if
7:       end for
8: end procedure

E. Mapping Data from a File to Image

This mechanism helps us to store raw data within images.
This algorithm also dynamically selects a new image using
algorithm 2, whenever an image is overflowed with data.
Algorithm 3: MdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read Img_Database [Img_Index];
3:        Compute PixelCount for Img_Database
           [Img_Index];
4:        Open F;
5:        while (Read Characters until EOF) do
6:                if (PixelCount < CCount)
7:                     Compute ASCII value;
8:                     Store each bits of ASCII into consecutive
                     8 pixels of the Img_Database
                     [Img_Index];
9:                else

10:                     Load Img_Index
                          1=ImgSearch (Img_Database);
11:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=
                          Img_Index 1;

12:                     Img_Database [Img_Index 1].valid=0;
13:                end if
14:        end while
15: end procedure

F. Retrieving Data from Image

When an authorized user wants to view data which are
already stored in remote cloud servers within images, the
following mechanism helps us to retrieve data into human
readable format.
Algorithm 4: RdfImage ()

1: procedure
2:        Read F;
3:        for File_Database (i), i?1, m do
4:                if (F exits)
5:                      I=Addres of image associated with F;
6:                end if
7:        end for
8:        Open Img_Database;
9:        Read Image_Database [I];
10:        Open an FTemp;
11:        while (Until all characters are within in FTemp) do
12:                k=Convert A8 to Character
13:                write k into FTemp;
14:         end while
15: end procedure

V. SEQUIRITY ANALISIS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we analyze our proposed model in terms
of security and efficiency. Our security analysis focuses on
the system architecture and its security model defined in
section II. We also evaluate the efficiency of our scheme via
implementing the file database and image database.
A. Security Strength Against CSP-1

As in CSP-1, we are storing only set of files which contains
only the address of valid images (i.e. those which have some
information). We have also stored here the set of images
which can store the information when the user wants to store
the data. So, when the images contain the information, an
unauthorized user cannot perceive anything by viewing these
images.
B. Security Strength Against CSP-2

In CSP-2, we are storing only the retrieving and hiding
mechanism which we will need at the time of viewing and
storing the data from CSP-3. So there is nothing to fear from
an unauthorized user.
C. Security Strength Against CSP-3

In our proposed model, we have chosen this CSP-3 for

computational purpose for any operation i.e. storing data
within  images  and  retrieving  data  from  images. After
performing the operation all the files are automatically de-
allocated from this service provider.
D. Performance Evaluation

We  implemented our  approach  using  the  concept  of
steganography. Our experiment is conducted using MATLAB
R2012b on a system with Intel(R) Pentium (CPU) running at
2.60 GHz, 2048 MB of RAM, a 7200RPM Western Digital 500
GB Serial ATA drive with an 8MB buffer. It has been found
that our implemented system successfully stores data within
images and retrieves data from images.

VI. RELATED WORK

Shacham et al. [5] built on this model and constructed a
random linear function based homomorphic authenticator
which enables unlimited number of queries and requires less
communication  overhead. Bowers  et al.  [7] proposed  an
improved framework for POR protocols that generalizes both
Juels and Shacham’s work. Later in their subsequent work,
Bowers et al. [6] extended POR model to distributed systems.
However, all these schemes are focusing on static data. The
effectiveness  of  their  schemes  rests  primarily  on  the
preprocessing  steps  that  the  user  conducts  before
outsourcing the data file F. Any change to the contents of F,
even few bits, must propagate through the error-correcting
code,  thus  introducing  significant  computation  and
communication  complexity.  Cong  Wang  et  al.  [3]  use
homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-
coded  data  towards  ensuring  data  storage  security  and
locating  the  server  being  attacked.  It  support  dynamic
operation on data blocks such as update, delete and append
without data corruption and loss. However, the issues with
fine-grained data error location remain to be addressed.

In other related work, Shantanu pal et al. [8] ensures the
identification of adversary or the attacking party and helping
us find a far off place for an attacking party from its target
and hence ensuring a more secure environment for the other
VMs. If the adversary gets to know the location of the other
VMs, it may try to attack them. This may harm the other VMs
in between. Flavio Lombardi et al. [9] show that behavior of
cloud components can be monitored by logging and periodic
checking of executable system file. But system performance
gets marginally degraded and small performance penalty is
encountered. Filho et al. [9] proposed to verify data integrity
using RSA-based  hash  to  demonstrate  escheatable  data
possession in peer to peer file sharing networks. However,
their proposal requires exponentiation over the entire data
file, which is clearly impractical for the server whenever the
file is large. Shah et al. [10] proposed allowing a TPA to keep
online  storage  honest  by  first  encrypting  the data  then
sending a number of pre computed symmetric-keyed hashes
over the encrypted data to the auditor. However, their scheme
only works for encrypted files and auditors must maintain
long-term state. Schwarz et al. [11] proposed to ensure file
integrity across multiple distributed servers, using erasure-

coding and block-level file integrity checks.

Ateniese  et  al.  [12]  defined  the  “provable  data
possession” (PDP) model for ensuring possession of file on
untrusted storages. Their scheme utilized public key based
homomorphic tags for auditing the data file, thus providing
public verifiability. In their subsequent work, Ateniese et al.
[13] described a PDP scheme that uses only symmetric key
cryptography. This method has lower-overhead than their
previous scheme and allows for block updates, deletions and
appends to the stored file, which has also been supported in
our work. However, their scheme focuses on single server
scenario and does not address small data corruptions, leaving
both the distributed scenario and data error recovery issue
unexplored.  Curtmola  et  al.  [14]  aimed  to  ensure  data
possession of multiple replicas across the distributed storage
system. They extended the PDP scheme to cover multiple
replicas without encoding each replica separately, providing
guarantees that multiple copies of data are actually maintained.
However, we have proposed a new scheme to provide the

better security in the world of cloud computing.

VII. CONCLUION

In this paper, we have investigated the problem of security
in cloud computing, which is essentially a distributed storage
system. To ensure the security of user’ data in cloud storage,
we  proposed  an  effective  and  efficient  steganographic
strategy for enhancing security on data-at-rest. So, when
these images are stored in the cloud data centre, no one can
view the original content  of the data without any proper
identification. Through detailed security and performance
analysis, we have seen that our scheme almost guarantees
the security of data when it is residing on the data center of
any Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

The concept we have discussed here, will help to build a
strong  architecture  for  security  in  the  field  of  cloud
computation. This kind of structure of security will also be
able to improve customer satisfaction to a great extent and
we will  attract  more  investor  in  this  cloud  computation
concept for industrial as well as future research farms. Security
in a very large scale cross cloud environment is an active
issue. This present scheme is able to handle only a limited
number of security threats in a fairly small environment. We
need further simulations to verify the performance. In the
future, we will extend our research by providing security
through steganography in RGB images. Also, if the raw data
is  encrypted  and the steganographic issues are  employed
then the protection will be a bit enhanced. The protections
can also be enhanced if we can change the pixel positions
after steganography. Till now we are working on it to get
better performance.
