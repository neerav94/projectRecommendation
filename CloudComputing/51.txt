INTRODUCTION 

 

In IOT application services through sharing the same huge cloud computing resource pool to obtain large system 
throughput capacity to meet user needs in some cases of ultra high computation or storage resource request, and the 
cost  is  the  total  amount  of  use  of  resources  costs  [1].  Dynamic  expansion  and  contraction  process  of  the  above 
system does not require user intervention, the system will automatically, developers on its platform but according to 
the  standard  and  follow  the  procedure  is  easy  to  be  extended  principle,  with  not  much  difference  between  the 
development of local application, the system developers and users have brought a lot of benefits, and the operator 
can also be middleware services the core link control firmly. 
 
The work principle of RFID is: label into the field, if the received reader special RF signals, can with the induced 
current obtained by the energy sending out the product information stored in the chips (i.e. Passive Tag, passive tags 
or passive tags), or take the initiative to send signals to send a frequency (i.e. Active Tag, active tags or active tags), 
the reader reads information and decoded, sent to the central information system on the data processing. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  system  is  mainly  to  achieve  the  following  two  objectives:  To  carry  on  the  business  process 
reengineering  of  logistics  enterprise  itself  (Business  Process  Re-Engineering,  BPR),  the  traditional  logistics 
enterprise  management  and  business  process  has  been  changed  fundamentally,  so  that  it  can  survive  in  the

through the computer network to realize the sharing and exchange of information. That is to say the world through 
RFID  and  other  information  sensing  did  not  have  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  eventually  realize  intelligent 
identification and management. The Internet of things will become the sensor network based on RFID technology, 
the RFID technology of Internet of things based on system is composed of the physical world and the logic space 
composed of 2 levels. 
 
Transportation  costs  under  the  influence  of  economic  globalization,  the  increasingly  fierce  competition.  How  to 
configure  and  use  of  resources  and  it  is  reduce  manufacturing  cost  and  enterprises  to  focus  on  the  problem.  To 
implement this strategy, not a highly advanced, reliable and efficient logistics system is unable to realize. With the 
development of economic globalization and the rise of network economy, the logistics function is no longer simple 
in  order  to  reduce  the  cost,  but  rather  becomes  improve  customer  service  quality  to  enhance  the  comprehensive 
competitiveness of enterprises. At present, the logistics industry is gradually formed seven development trends, they 
are  respectively  and  the  third  party  logistics  cooperative  information,  intelligence,  environmental  protection, 
enterprise  globalization  and  internationalization,  service  quality,  industry.  The  paper  presents  build  intelligent 
logistics system based on Internet of things RFID in the platform of cloud computing.

SDK provides application development tools in the cloud platform, similar to the traditional API development, but 
here the SDK is a customized, provide the interface of application service cloud computing platform architecture. 
The main purpose of SDK is to provide enterprises to meet the personalized needs of IT. In the current enterprise 
management software model, when enterprises need some personalized software, technical department will take this 
application  to  the  server.  If  there  is  a  cloud  computing  platform  to  provide  services,  enterprises  can  develop 
personalized application by using SDK. 
 
Logistics  in  the  field  of  cloud  computing,  can  let  the  logistics  enterprises  according  to  the  actual  size  and  its 
requirements; dynamically select the corresponding visual resources and services on the Internet cloud, so as to meet 
the need of the enterprise in the daily operations in the process of the IT service. IBM wisdom "logistics cloud" put 
forward a similar concept [2]. It provides a cloud based intelligent logistics plan, can put the things used in logistics, 
intelligence will progress cargo handling, transport, storage, maintenance and customs clearance, logistics industry, 
fast efficient, intensive, transparent, save the management cost, improve the management level. 
 
SDK provides support for enterprise application basic API, including storage service, queue service, authentication 
service  etc..  In  addition  also  provides  the  ability  to  invoke  the  Web  Service  and  packaged  into  Web  Service  for 
external calls. Problems and countermeasures have been, security problems are restricting the development of cloud 
computing, cloud computing is the biggest obstacle in the implementation of enterprises. This paper summarizes the 
security platform facing and puts forward the corresponding countermeasures, as is shown by equation1.

PaaS provides all the required for the operation of the Internet application infrastructure. Users only need to "open

subscription  model,  so  the  user  only  needs  to  pay  for  his  use  of  function.  Using  PaaS,  independent  software 
developers  and  enterprise  IT  departments  is  to  focus  more  on  innovation,  rather  than  the  complex  infrastructure.

The Internet of things worth is not a network capable of sensing, but must all sectors involved application, different

characteristics of the industry, for the development of in-depth study and valuable. This application development can 
not  rely  on  the  operator;  can  not  just  rely  on  the  so-called  Internet  enterprise,  because  operators  and  technology 
companies are unable to understand the requirements of the industry and the industry specific.

In  cloud  computing  platform  of  general  data  through  the  Internet  transmission,  data  by  the  cloud  service 
management need to keep the security of the data, including the calculation and data backup of the data on the server 
[3]. Generally speaking, the enterprise data security requirements, such as customer information, contract bidding 
rules. But the enterprise the data submitted to the cloud computing platform, enterprises will lose control of the data, 
unable to ensure the security of the data, increase the likelihood that data is leaked. 
 
The  logistics  department  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  shipper  sales  invoice  generation  Chukuchan: 
according to the outbound priority (such as the date of production priority  from the  front) query outbound  goods 
storage bin and inventory status to the  warehouse,  such as customer specified  number specified batch query, and 
outbound goods delivery into position and the corresponding tray of goods. Picking a person carrying out of order to 
the  warehouse  manager,  and  it  is  warehouse  keeper  check  information  for  executing  the  corresponding  product 
warehouse forklift driver.     
 
At present, the Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Sun companies such as cloud computing infrastructure or cloud 
computing  platform,  open  source  organizations  and  academic  circles  have  put  forward  many  cloud  computing 
system or platform. The Google cloud computing infrastructure Google cloud computing infrastructure in the initial

system  reliability,  availability,  skeptical,  worried  about  the  timely  resolution  of  problems  can  not  be  services, 
comprehensive application and so on have affected the enterprise cloud computing. To solve this problem, it can 
introduce SLA service level agreement to provide reliable service to the user. At the same time, SLA can further 
constraints  on  the  cloud  service  provider,  improve  service  quality;  I  can  increase  the  enterprise  users  of  cloud 
services of confidence. 
 
Sun's cloud infrastructure architecture, including service application, middleware, operating system, virtual server, 
physical server and so on 6 levels, the proposed "cloud computing can be described from hardware to any traditional 
hierarchical  application  services"  point  of  view.  The  Azure  cloud  platform  of  Microsoft  includes  4  levels.  The 
bottom  layer  is  Microsoft  Global  Foundation  Services  System  (globalfoundationservice,  GFS),  from  all  over  the 
world  the  fourth  generation  data  center;  cloud  infrastructure  service  layer  (cloudinfrastructureservice)  on  the 
WindowsAzure operating system as the core, mainly engaged in virtualized computing resource management and 
intelligent  task  allocation;  WindowsAzure  is  an  application  service  platform,  it  plays  a  member  (BuildingBlock) 
function, provides a range of services for users. 
 
The  third  party  logistics  enterprise,  the  span  of  regional  storage  location  is  great,  and  therefore  need  to  network 
distributed storage management and inventory control technology to reduce management costs, improve efficiency. 
Network  distributed  storage  management  and  inventory  control  technology  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ILS  [4]. 
Distributed storage  management and inventory control  module is a part, ERP software at present, relatively large 
ERP system, such as SAP R/3 including the module. In order to ensure consistency, that is established in the local 
area  of  all,  as  is  equation3.  Where  the  main  features  of  the  covariance  P  matrix  of  the  noise  correction  value

INTRODUCTION 

 

In IOT application services through sharing the same huge cloud computing resource pool to obtain large system 
throughput capacity to meet user needs in some cases of ultra high computation or storage resource request, and the 
cost  is  the  total  amount  of  use  of  resources  costs  [1].  Dynamic  expansion  and  contraction  process  of  the  above 
system does not require user intervention, the system will automatically, developers on its platform but according to 
the  standard  and  follow  the  procedure  is  easy  to  be  extended  principle,  with  not  much  difference  between  the 
development of local application, the system developers and users have brought a lot of benefits, and the operator 
can also be middleware services the core link control firmly. 
 
The work principle of RFID is: label into the field, if the received reader special RF signals, can with the induced 
current obtained by the energy sending out the product information stored in the chips (i.e. Passive Tag, passive tags 
or passive tags), or take the initiative to send signals to send a frequency (i.e. Active Tag, active tags or active tags), 
the reader reads information and decoded, sent to the central information system on the data processing. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  system  is  mainly  to  achieve  the  following  two  objectives:  To  carry  on  the  business  process 
reengineering  of  logistics  enterprise  itself  (Business  Process  Re-Engineering,  BPR),  the  traditional  logistics 
enterprise  management  and  business  process  has  been  changed  fundamentally,  so  that  it  can  survive  in  the 
information society. In the EC operating environment, providing value-added logistics services have not provide for 
the customer, the value-added logistics services will enhance the convenience of logistics services, to accelerate the 
reaction speed and reduce the service cost, extended enterprises downstream in the supply chain of the business. 
 
Using the technology of RFID network in the world all items together, can be "communication between each other 
and articles". RFID tags are stored in the items of information, the reader information obtained through wireless data 
communication network automatic acquisition to the central information system, to realize the goods identification;

through the computer network to realize the sharing and exchange of information. That is to say the world through 
RFID  and  other  information  sensing  did  not  have  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  eventually  realize  intelligent 
identification and management. The Internet of things will become the sensor network based on RFID technology, 
the RFID technology of Internet of things based on system is composed of the physical world and the logic space 
composed of 2 levels. 
 
Transportation  costs  under  the  influence  of  economic  globalization,  the  increasingly  fierce  competition.  How  to 
configure  and  use  of  resources  and  it  is  reduce  manufacturing  cost  and  enterprises  to  focus  on  the  problem.  To 
implement this strategy, not a highly advanced, reliable and efficient logistics system is unable to realize. With the 
development of economic globalization and the rise of network economy, the logistics function is no longer simple 
in  order  to  reduce  the  cost,  but  rather  becomes  improve  customer  service  quality  to  enhance  the  comprehensive 
competitiveness of enterprises. At present, the logistics industry is gradually formed seven development trends, they 
are  respectively  and  the  third  party  logistics  cooperative  information,  intelligence,  environmental  protection, 
enterprise  globalization  and  internationalization,  service  quality,  industry.  The  paper  presents  build  intelligent 
logistics system based on Internet of things RFID in the platform of cloud computing. 
 
2. Design of Intelligent Logistics System based on Platform of Cloud Computing 
SDK provides application development tools in the cloud platform, similar to the traditional API development, but 
here the SDK is a customized, provide the interface of application service cloud computing platform architecture. 
The main purpose of SDK is to provide enterprises to meet the personalized needs of IT. In the current enterprise 
management software model, when enterprises need some personalized software, technical department will take this 
application  to  the  server.  If  there  is  a  cloud  computing  platform  to  provide  services,  enterprises  can  develop 
personalized application by using SDK. 
 
Logistics  in  the  field  of  cloud  computing,  can  let  the  logistics  enterprises  according  to  the  actual  size  and  its 
requirements; dynamically select the corresponding visual resources and services on the Internet cloud, so as to meet 
the need of the enterprise in the daily operations in the process of the IT service. IBM wisdom "logistics cloud" put 
forward a similar concept [2]. It provides a cloud based intelligent logistics plan, can put the things used in logistics, 
intelligence will progress cargo handling, transport, storage, maintenance and customs clearance, logistics industry, 
fast efficient, intensive, transparent, save the management cost, improve the management level. 
 
SDK provides support for enterprise application basic API, including storage service, queue service, authentication 
service  etc..  In  addition  also  provides  the  ability  to  invoke  the  Web  Service  and  packaged  into  Web  Service  for 
external calls. Problems and countermeasures have been, security problems are restricting the development of cloud 
computing, cloud computing is the biggest obstacle in the implementation of enterprises. This paper summarizes the 
security platform facing and puts forward the corresponding countermeasures, as is shown by equation1.

coefficient  sequence,  which 
service and application development platform -- PaaS (Plat-formasaserice), on the one hand, provide a platform, to 
build and run the software services at the same time, on the other hand, it is responsible for the management of all 
hardware  and  software  resources,  through  the  Internet  to  provide  on-demand,  based  on  Web  software  solutions. 
PaaS provides all the required for the operation of the Internet application infrastructure. Users only need to "open 
water"  to  obtain  the  service,  they  don't  have  to  worry  about  behind  the  scenes  complexity.  PaaS  is  based  on  a 
subscription  model,  so  the  user  only  needs  to  pay  for  his  use  of  function.  Using  PaaS,  independent  software 
developers  and  enterprise  IT  departments  is  to  focus  more  on  innovation,  rather  than  the  complex  infrastructure. 
Logistics enterprises can budget more into can provide real value to the business place, rather than basic equipment 
purchase and maintenance. 
 
The Internet of things worth is not a network capable of sensing, but must all sectors involved application, different 
industries,  will  have  different  application,  will  have  different  requirements,  these  must  be  based  on  the 
characteristics of the industry, for the development of in-depth study and valuable. This application development can 
not  rely  on  the  operator;  can  not  just  rely  on  the  so-called  Internet  enterprise,  because  operators  and  technology 
companies are unable to understand the requirements of the industry and the industry specific.

In  cloud  computing  platform  of  general  data  through  the  Internet  transmission,  data  by  the  cloud  service 
management need to keep the security of the data, including the calculation and data backup of the data on the server 
[3]. Generally speaking, the enterprise data security requirements, such as customer information, contract bidding 
rules. But the enterprise the data submitted to the cloud computing platform, enterprises will lose control of the data, 
unable to ensure the security of the data, increase the likelihood that data is leaked. 
 
The  logistics  department  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  shipper  sales  invoice  generation  Chukuchan: 
according to the outbound priority (such as the date of production priority  from the  front) query outbound  goods 
storage bin and inventory status to the  warehouse,  such as customer specified  number specified batch query, and 
outbound goods delivery into position and the corresponding tray of goods. Picking a person carrying out of order to 
the  warehouse  manager,  and  it  is  warehouse  keeper  check  information  for  executing  the  corresponding  product 
warehouse forklift driver.     
 
At present, the Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Sun companies such as cloud computing infrastructure or cloud 
computing  platform,  open  source  organizations  and  academic  circles  have  put  forward  many  cloud  computing 
system or platform. The Google cloud computing infrastructure Google cloud computing infrastructure in the initial 
search services  for application based on gradually  extended, consists of distributed file  system  GoogleFileSystem 
(GFS) system is composed of it, several large-scale distributed database BigTable, MapReduce programming mode, 
distributed  Chubby  locking  mechanism,  independent  and  closely.  "Blue  cloud  computing  platform  3.2IBM"  IBM 
"Lan  Yun  (BlueCloud)"  computing  platform  is  composed  of  a  data  center  monitoring  software,  IBMTivoli 
(Tivolimonitoring), 
software 
(Tivoliprovi-sioningmanager), IBMWebSphere application server and open source virtualization software and open 
source software consists of information processing, as is shown by equation2.

is uncorrelated. In the face of cloud computing services, business users will usually on 
system  reliability,  availability,  skeptical,  worried  about  the  timely  resolution  of  problems  can  not  be  services, 
comprehensive application and so on have affected the enterprise cloud computing. To solve this problem, it can 
introduce SLA service level agreement to provide reliable service to the user. At the same time, SLA can further 
constraints  on  the  cloud  service  provider,  improve  service  quality;  I  can  increase  the  enterprise  users  of  cloud 
services of confidence. 
 
Sun's cloud infrastructure architecture, including service application, middleware, operating system, virtual server, 
physical server and so on 6 levels, the proposed "cloud computing can be described from hardware to any traditional 
hierarchical  application  services"  point  of  view.  The  Azure  cloud  platform  of  Microsoft  includes  4  levels.  The 
bottom  layer  is  Microsoft  Global  Foundation  Services  System  (globalfoundationservice,  GFS),  from  all  over  the 
world  the  fourth  generation  data  center;  cloud  infrastructure  service  layer  (cloudinfrastructureservice)  on  the 
WindowsAzure operating system as the core, mainly engaged in virtualized computing resource management and 
intelligent  task  allocation;  WindowsAzure  is  an  application  service  platform,  it  plays  a  member  (BuildingBlock) 
function, provides a range of services for users. 
 
The  third  party  logistics  enterprise,  the  span  of  regional  storage  location  is  great,  and  therefore  need  to  network 
distributed storage management and inventory control technology to reduce management costs, improve efficiency. 
Network  distributed  storage  management  and  inventory  control  technology  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ILS  [4]. 
Distributed storage  management and inventory control  module is a part, ERP software at present, relatively large 
ERP system, such as SAP R/3 including the module. In order to ensure consistency, that is established in the local 
area  of  all,  as  is  equation3.  Where  the  main  features  of  the  covariance  P  matrix  of  the  noise  correction  value

problem of infinite growth, allows the IT infrastructure to realize resource and service, so that users can customize 
according to need, thus changing the traditional IT infrastructure delivery and payment. 
 
Many  cloud  computing  deployment  depends  on  the  computer  cluster  (but  with  grid  composition,  architecture, 
working  mode,  to  be  quite  different),  also  absorbed  the  characteristics  of  autonomic  computing  and  utility 
computing. In a large number of distributed computers through the calculation, rather than the local computer or a 
remote server, enterprise data center operation will be more similar with the internet. This makes the enterprise can 
be  resource  switch  on  the  application  of  need,  demand  according  to  visit  the  computer  and  storage  system.  Like 
from  a  single  generator  model  ancient  to  power  plant  centralized  power  supply  mode.  It  means  that  computing 
power  can  also  be  used  as  a kind  of  commodity  circulation,  like  gas,  hydropower,  and  convenient  use,  low  cost. 
Biggest difference lies in that; it is to be transmitted through the internet.                     
                                                             
The cloud computing platforms have their own different characteristics. Especially in the platform use, transparent 
computing  platform  for  the  user  and  provides  a  client  node  user  actual  contact  and  remote  virtual  storage  server 
cannot  be  contacted.  1.5  Open.  Google  platforms  for  cloud  computing  environment  is  a  private  environment,  in 
addition  to  the  application  program  interface  open  limited,  such  as  GWT  (GoogleWebtoolkit),  except  for 
GoogleAppEngine and GoogleMapAPI, Google and no cloud computing internal infrastructure sharing to external 
users  to  use  it.  IBM's  "blue  cloud  computing  platform  is  soft,"  the  set  of  hardware  available  for  sale,  the  soft, 
hardware  products  to  build  their  own  cloud  computing  applications  based  on  Amazon  elastic  cloud  computing  is 
managed  cloud  computing  platform,  users  can  remote  operating  direct  manipulation  user  interface,  not  to  see  the 
actual physical node [5]. From the perspective of the other differences is between the cloud computing systems. It 
can be seen that, although cloud computing systems are common in  many  ways, but in fact each system still has 
very big different, it also calculates the user or developer to cloud brought different experience. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  is  to  deepen  the  application  based  on  the  Internet,  the  Internet  of  things  technology,  analysis 
technology  by  using  the  advanced  information  collection,  information  processing,  information  flow,  information 
management,  intelligent,  completed  intelligent  transportation,  warehousing,  distribution,  packaging,  handling  a 
number of links, and the real-time feedback flow, enhanced flow monitoring, enables fast efficient delivery to the 
demand from the suppliers, so as to provide maximum profits for the supplier, to provide the most efficient service 
for  the  demand  side,  greatly  reduce  the  consumption  of  natural  resources  and  social  resources,  maximize  the 
protection of the natural ecological environment. 
 
3. Application of Internet of Things RFID in Intelligent Logistics System 
Internet of things through the sensor, RFID technology, mobile phone, GPS and other equipment, all objects in the 
world are connected to the information network, fully embodies the integration of physical space and information 
space,  but  also  provides  to  the  matter,  to  complex,  interconnected  relationship  between  person  and  person,  thus 
reducing the. Information systems and physical distance in the world, to construct coverage of all things in the world 
of "Internet of Things", one of its core technologies is the RFID technology. 
 
RFID reader is a wireless transmitting and receiving equipment, mainly including the RF module and digital signal 
processing  unit  2  part  of  read  and  write  operations,  label,  reader  demodulate  and  decode  the  received  radio 
frequency signal, and then sent to the application system through network. So it has a strong ability of storage and 
computation. 
 
Although RFID is fast in every field, but with respect to our country economy of scale, the scope of its application is 
still far from achieving wide degree, even in the transport and logistics industry RFID application more and more, 
and also at the point distribution state, and can not reach the surface state. Often is the industry leading enterprises to 
maintain  its  competitive  position  and  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  use  this  kind  of  new  technology,  more  and  more 
enterprises have a wait-and-see attitude and hesitation. Or to the logistics industry as an example, the application of 
RFID  technology  can  greatly  improve  the  operation  efficiency  of  logistics,  such  as  speeding  up  the  goods  out  of 
storage  time,  reduce  the  field  operation  personnel,  realize  accurate  inventory  fast  and  accurate  positioning,  cargo 
tracking [6].

service and application development platform -- PaaS (Plat-formasaserice), on the one hand, provide a platform, to 
build and run the software services at the same time, on the other hand, it is responsible for the management of all 
hardware  and  software  resources,  through  the  Internet  to  provide  on-demand,  based  on  Web  software  solutions. 
PaaS provides all the required for the operation of the Internet application infrastructure. Users only need to "open 
water"  to  obtain  the  service,  they  don't  have  to  worry  about  behind  the  scenes  complexity.  PaaS  is  based  on  a 
subscription  model,  so  the  user  only  needs  to  pay  for  his  use  of  function.  Using  PaaS,  independent  software 
developers  and  enterprise  IT  departments  is  to  focus  more  on  innovation,  rather  than  the  complex  infrastructure. 
Logistics enterprises can budget more into can provide real value to the business place, rather than basic equipment 
purchase and maintenance. 
 
The Internet of things worth is not a network capable of sensing, but must all sectors involved application, different 
industries,  will  have  different  application,  will  have  different  requirements,  these  must  be  based  on  the 
characteristics of the industry, for the development of in-depth study and valuable. This application development can 
not  rely  on  the  operator;  can  not  just  rely  on  the  so-called  Internet  enterprise,  because  operators  and  technology 
companies are unable to understand the requirements of the industry and the industry specific.

In  cloud  computing  platform  of  general  data  through  the  Internet  transmission,  data  by  the  cloud  service 
management need to keep the security of the data, including the calculation and data backup of the data on the server 
[3]. Generally speaking, the enterprise data security requirements, such as customer information, contract bidding 
rules. But the enterprise the data submitted to the cloud computing platform, enterprises will lose control of the data, 
unable to ensure the security of the data, increase the likelihood that data is leaked. 
 
The  logistics  department  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  shipper  sales  invoice  generation  Chukuchan: 
according to the outbound priority (such as the date of production priority  from the  front) query outbound  goods 
storage bin and inventory status to the  warehouse,  such as customer specified  number specified batch query, and 
outbound goods delivery into position and the corresponding tray of goods. Picking a person carrying out of order to 
the  warehouse  manager,  and  it  is  warehouse  keeper  check  information  for  executing  the  corresponding  product

At present, the Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Sun companies such as cloud computing infrastructure or cloud 
computing  platform,  open  source  organizations  and  academic  circles  have  put  forward  many  cloud  computing 
system or platform. The Google cloud computing infrastructure Google cloud computing infrastructure in the initial

system  reliability,  availability,  skeptical,  worried  about  the  timely  resolution  of  problems  can  not  be  services, 
comprehensive application and so on have affected the enterprise cloud computing. To solve this problem, it can 
introduce SLA service level agreement to provide reliable service to the user. At the same time, SLA can further 
constraints  on  the  cloud  service  provider,  improve  service  quality;  I  can  increase  the  enterprise  users  of  cloud 
services of confidence. 
 
Sun's cloud infrastructure architecture, including service application, middleware, operating system, virtual server, 
physical server and so on 6 levels, the proposed "cloud computing can be described from hardware to any traditional 
hierarchical  application  services"  point  of  view.  The  Azure  cloud  platform  of  Microsoft  includes  4  levels.  The 
bottom  layer  is  Microsoft  Global  Foundation  Services  System  (globalfoundationservice,  GFS),  from  all  over  the 
world  the  fourth  generation  data  center;  cloud  infrastructure  service  layer  (cloudinfrastructureservice)  on  the 
WindowsAzure operating system as the core, mainly engaged in virtualized computing resource management and 
intelligent  task  allocation;  WindowsAzure  is  an  application  service  platform,  it  plays  a  member  (BuildingBlock) 
function, provides a range of services for users. 
 
The  third  party  logistics  enterprise,  the  span  of  regional  storage  location  is  great,  and  therefore  need  to  network 
distributed storage management and inventory control technology to reduce management costs, improve efficiency. 
Network  distributed  storage  management  and  inventory  control  technology  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ILS  [4]. 
Distributed storage  management and inventory control  module is a part, ERP software at present, relatively large 
ERP system, such as SAP R/3 including the module. In order to ensure consistency, that is established in the local 
area  of  all,  as  is  equation3.  Where  the  main  features  of  the  covariance  P  matrix  of  the  noise  correction  value

problem of infinite growth, allows the IT infrastructure to realize resource and service, so that users can customize 
according to need, thus changing the traditional IT infrastructure delivery and payment. 
 
Many  cloud  computing  deployment  depends  on  the  computer  cluster  (but  with  grid  composition,  architecture, 
working  mode,  to  be  quite  different),  also  absorbed  the  characteristics  of  autonomic  computing  and  utility 
computing. In a large number of distributed computers through the calculation, rather than the local computer or a 
remote server, enterprise data center operation will be more similar with the internet. This makes the enterprise can 
be  resource  switch  on  the  application  of  need,  demand  according  to  visit  the  computer  and  storage  system.  Like 
from  a  single  generator  model  ancient  to  power  plant  centralized  power  supply  mode.  It  means  that  computing 
power  can  also  be  used  as  a kind  of  commodity  circulation,  like  gas,  hydropower,  and  convenient  use,  low  cost. 
Biggest difference lies in that; it is to be transmitted through the internet.                     
                                                             
The cloud computing platforms have their own different characteristics. Especially in the platform use, transparent 
computing  platform  for  the  user  and  provides  a  client  node  user  actual  contact  and  remote  virtual  storage  server 
cannot  be  contacted.  1.5  Open.  Google  platforms  for  cloud  computing  environment  is  a  private  environment,  in 
addition  to  the  application  program  interface  open  limited,  such  as  GWT  (GoogleWebtoolkit),  except  for 
GoogleAppEngine and GoogleMapAPI, Google and no cloud computing internal infrastructure sharing to external 
users  to  use  it.  IBM's  "blue  cloud  computing  platform  is  soft,"  the  set  of  hardware  available  for  sale,  the  soft, 
hardware  products  to  build  their  own  cloud  computing  applications  based  on  Amazon  elastic  cloud  computing  is 
managed  cloud  computing  platform,  users  can  remote  operating  direct  manipulation  user  interface,  not  to  see  the 
actual physical node [5]. From the perspective of the other differences is between the cloud computing systems. It 
can be seen that, although cloud computing systems are common in  many  ways, but in fact each system still has 
very big different, it also calculates the user or developer to cloud brought different experience. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  is  to  deepen  the  application  based  on  the  Internet,  the  Internet  of  things  technology,  analysis 
technology  by  using  the  advanced  information  collection,  information  processing,  information  flow,  information 
management,  intelligent,  completed  intelligent  transportation,  warehousing,  distribution,  packaging,  handling  a 
number of links, and the real-time feedback flow, enhanced flow monitoring, enables fast efficient delivery to the 
demand from the suppliers, so as to provide maximum profits for the supplier, to provide the most efficient service 
for  the  demand  side,  greatly  reduce  the  consumption  of  natural  resources  and  social  resources,  maximize  the 
protection of the natural ecological environment. 
 
3. Application of Internet of Things RFID in Intelligent Logistics System 
Internet of things through the sensor, RFID technology, mobile phone, GPS and other equipment, all objects in the 
world are connected to the information network, fully embodies the integration of physical space and information 
space,  but  also  provides  to  the  matter,  to  complex,  interconnected  relationship  between  person  and  person,  thus 
reducing the. Information systems and physical distance in the world, to construct coverage of all things in the world 
of "Internet of Things", one of its core technologies is the RFID technology. 
 
RFID reader is a wireless transmitting and receiving equipment, mainly including the RF module and digital signal 
processing  unit  2  part  of  read  and  write  operations,  label,  reader  demodulate  and  decode  the  received  radio 
frequency signal, and then sent to the application system through network. So it has a strong ability of storage and 
computation. 
 
Although RFID is fast in every field, but with respect to our country economy of scale, the scope of its application is 
still far from achieving wide degree, even in the transport and logistics industry RFID application more and more, 
and also at the point distribution state, and can not reach the surface state. Often is the industry leading enterprises to 
maintain  its  competitive  position  and  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  use  this  kind  of  new  technology,  more  and  more 
enterprises have a wait-and-see attitude and hesitation. Or to the logistics industry as an example, the application of 
RFID  technology  can  greatly  improve  the  operation  efficiency  of  logistics,  such  as  speeding  up  the  goods  out  of 
storage  time,  reduce  the  field  operation  personnel,  realize  accurate  inventory  fast  and  accurate  positioning,  cargo 
tracking [6].

ABSTRACT 
 
RFID technology in logistics system is widely used as the core in Internet of things and plays an important role in 
the field of logistics management. The EPC code is stored in the RFID tag, can realize the identification of the real 
target.  Cloud  computing  is  a  distributed  processing,  parallel  processing  and  grid  computing  development, 
distributed in a large number of distributed computers through the calculation, rather than the local computer or a 
remote server, enterprise data center operation will be more similar as internet. The paper presents build intelligent 
logistics system based on Internet of things RFID in the platform of cloud computing. Simulation results validate the 
effectiveness of the proposed model.   
 
Keywords: RFID, Cloud computing, Internet of things, Intelligent logistics system.

INTRODUCTION 

 

In IOT application services through sharing the same huge cloud computing resource pool to obtain large system 
throughput capacity to meet user needs in some cases of ultra high computation or storage resource request, and the 
cost  is  the  total  amount  of  use  of  resources  costs  [1].  Dynamic  expansion  and  contraction  process  of  the  above 
system does not require user intervention, the system will automatically, developers on its platform but according to 
the  standard  and  follow  the  procedure  is  easy  to  be  extended  principle,  with  not  much  difference  between  the 
development of local application, the system developers and users have brought a lot of benefits, and the operator 
can also be middleware services the core link control firmly. 
 
The work principle of RFID is: label into the field, if the received reader special RF signals, can with the induced 
current obtained by the energy sending out the product information stored in the chips (i.e. Passive Tag, passive tags 
or passive tags), or take the initiative to send signals to send a frequency (i.e. Active Tag, active tags or active tags), 
the reader reads information and decoded, sent to the central information system on the data processing. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  system  is  mainly  to  achieve  the  following  two  objectives:  To  carry  on  the  business  process 
reengineering  of  logistics  enterprise  itself  (Business  Process  Re-Engineering,  BPR),  the  traditional  logistics 
enterprise  management  and  business  process  has  been  changed  fundamentally,  so  that  it  can  survive  in  the 
information society. In the EC operating environment, providing value-added logistics services have not provide for 
the customer, the value-added logistics services will enhance the convenience of logistics services, to accelerate the 
reaction speed and reduce the service cost, extended enterprises downstream in the supply chain of the business. 
 
Using the technology of RFID network in the world all items together, can be "communication between each other 
and articles". RFID tags are stored in the items of information, the reader information obtained through wireless data 
communication network automatic acquisition to the central information system, to realize the goods identification;

through the computer network to realize the sharing and exchange of information. That is to say the world through 
RFID  and  other  information  sensing  did  not  have  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  eventually  realize  intelligent 
identification and management. The Internet of things will become the sensor network based on RFID technology, 
the RFID technology of Internet of things based on system is composed of the physical world and the logic space 
composed of 2 levels. 
 
Transportation  costs  under  the  influence  of  economic  globalization,  the  increasingly  fierce  competition.  How  to 
configure  and  use  of  resources  and  it  is  reduce  manufacturing  cost  and  enterprises  to  focus  on  the  problem.  To 
implement this strategy, not a highly advanced, reliable and efficient logistics system is unable to realize. With the 
development of economic globalization and the rise of network economy, the logistics function is no longer simple 
in  order  to  reduce  the  cost,  but  rather  becomes  improve  customer  service  quality  to  enhance  the  comprehensive 
competitiveness of enterprises. At present, the logistics industry is gradually formed seven development trends, they 
are  respectively  and  the  third  party  logistics  cooperative  information,  intelligence,  environmental  protection, 
enterprise  globalization  and  internationalization,  service  quality,  industry.  The  paper  presents  build  intelligent 
logistics system based on Internet of things RFID in the platform of cloud computing. 
 
2. Design of Intelligent Logistics System based on Platform of Cloud Computing 
SDK provides application development tools in the cloud platform, similar to the traditional API development, but 
here the SDK is a customized, provide the interface of application service cloud computing platform architecture. 
The main purpose of SDK is to provide enterprises to meet the personalized needs of IT. In the current enterprise 
management software model, when enterprises need some personalized software, technical department will take this 
application  to  the  server.  If  there  is  a  cloud  computing  platform  to  provide  services,  enterprises  can  develop 
personalized application by using SDK. 
 
Logistics  in  the  field  of  cloud  computing,  can  let  the  logistics  enterprises  according  to  the  actual  size  and  its 
requirements; dynamically select the corresponding visual resources and services on the Internet cloud, so as to meet 
the need of the enterprise in the daily operations in the process of the IT service. IBM wisdom "logistics cloud" put 
forward a similar concept [2]. It provides a cloud based intelligent logistics plan, can put the things used in logistics, 
intelligence will progress cargo handling, transport, storage, maintenance and customs clearance, logistics industry, 
fast efficient, intensive, transparent, save the management cost, improve the management level. 
 
SDK provides support for enterprise application basic API, including storage service, queue service, authentication 
service  etc..  In  addition  also  provides  the  ability  to  invoke  the  Web  Service  and  packaged  into  Web  Service  for 
external calls. Problems and countermeasures have been, security problems are restricting the development of cloud 
computing, cloud computing is the biggest obstacle in the implementation of enterprises. This paper summarizes the 
security platform facing and puts forward the corresponding countermeasures, as is shown by equation1.

hardware  and  software  resources,  through  the  Internet  to  provide  on-demand,  based  on  Web  software  solutions. 
PaaS provides all the required for the operation of the Internet application infrastructure. Users only need to "open 
water"  to  obtain  the  service,  they  don't  have  to  worry  about  behind  the  scenes  complexity.  PaaS  is  based  on  a 
subscription  model,  so  the  user  only  needs  to  pay  for  his  use  of  function.  Using  PaaS,  independent  software 
developers  and  enterprise  IT  departments  is  to  focus  more  on  innovation,  rather  than  the  complex  infrastructure. 
Logistics enterprises can budget more into can provide real value to the business place, rather than basic equipment

The Internet of things worth is not a network capable of sensing, but must all sectors involved application, different 
industries,  will  have  different  application,  will  have  different  requirements,  these  must  be  based  on  the 
characteristics of the industry, for the development of in-depth study and valuable. This application development can 
not  rely  on  the  operator;  can  not  just  rely  on  the  so-called  Internet  enterprise,  because  operators  and  technology 
companies are unable to understand the requirements of the industry and the industry specific.

In  cloud  computing  platform  of  general  data  through  the  Internet  transmission,  data  by  the  cloud  service 
management need to keep the security of the data, including the calculation and data backup of the data on the server 
[3]. Generally speaking, the enterprise data security requirements, such as customer information, contract bidding 
rules. But the enterprise the data submitted to the cloud computing platform, enterprises will lose control of the data, 
unable to ensure the security of the data, increase the likelihood that data is leaked. 
 
The  logistics  department  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  shipper  sales  invoice  generation  Chukuchan: 
according to the outbound priority (such as the date of production priority  from the  front) query outbound  goods 
storage bin and inventory status to the  warehouse,  such as customer specified  number specified batch query, and 
outbound goods delivery into position and the corresponding tray of goods. Picking a person carrying out of order to 
the  warehouse  manager,  and  it  is  warehouse  keeper  check  information  for  executing  the  corresponding  product

At present, the Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Sun companies such as cloud computing infrastructure or cloud 
computing  platform,  open  source  organizations  and  academic  circles  have  put  forward  many  cloud  computing 
system or platform. The Google cloud computing infrastructure Google cloud computing infrastructure in the initial 
search services  for application based on gradually  extended, consists of distributed file  system  GoogleFileSystem 
(GFS) system is composed of it, several large-scale distributed database BigTable, MapReduce programming mode,

system  reliability,  availability,  skeptical,  worried  about  the  timely  resolution  of  problems  can  not  be  services, 
comprehensive application and so on have affected the enterprise cloud computing. To solve this problem, it can 
introduce SLA service level agreement to provide reliable service to the user. At the same time, SLA can further 
constraints  on  the  cloud  service  provider,  improve  service  quality;  I  can  increase  the  enterprise  users  of  cloud 
services of confidence. 
 
Sun's cloud infrastructure architecture, including service application, middleware, operating system, virtual server, 
physical server and so on 6 levels, the proposed "cloud computing can be described from hardware to any traditional 
hierarchical  application  services"  point  of  view.  The  Azure  cloud  platform  of  Microsoft  includes  4  levels.  The 
bottom  layer  is  Microsoft  Global  Foundation  Services  System  (globalfoundationservice,  GFS),  from  all  over  the 
world  the  fourth  generation  data  center;  cloud  infrastructure  service  layer  (cloudinfrastructureservice)  on  the 
WindowsAzure operating system as the core, mainly engaged in virtualized computing resource management and 
intelligent  task  allocation;  WindowsAzure  is  an  application  service  platform,  it  plays  a  member  (BuildingBlock) 
function, provides a range of services for users. 
 
The  third  party  logistics  enterprise,  the  span  of  regional  storage  location  is  great,  and  therefore  need  to  network 
distributed storage management and inventory control technology to reduce management costs, improve efficiency. 
Network  distributed  storage  management  and  inventory  control  technology  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ILS  [4]. 
Distributed storage  management and inventory control  module is a part, ERP software at present, relatively large 
ERP system, such as SAP R/3 including the module. In order to ensure consistency, that is established in the local

problem of infinite growth, allows the IT infrastructure to realize resource and service, so that users can customize 
according to need, thus changing the traditional IT infrastructure delivery and payment. 
 
Many  cloud  computing  deployment  depends  on  the  computer  cluster  (but  with  grid  composition,  architecture, 
working  mode,  to  be  quite  different),  also  absorbed  the  characteristics  of  autonomic  computing  and  utility 
computing. In a large number of distributed computers through the calculation, rather than the local computer or a 
remote server, enterprise data center operation will be more similar with the internet. This makes the enterprise can 
be  resource  switch  on  the  application  of  need,  demand  according  to  visit  the  computer  and  storage  system.  Like 
from  a  single  generator  model  ancient  to  power  plant  centralized  power  supply  mode.  It  means  that  computing 
power  can  also  be  used  as  a kind  of  commodity  circulation,  like  gas,  hydropower,  and  convenient  use,  low  cost. 
Biggest difference lies in that; it is to be transmitted through the internet.                     
                                                             
The cloud computing platforms have their own different characteristics. Especially in the platform use, transparent 
computing  platform  for  the  user  and  provides  a  client  node  user  actual  contact  and  remote  virtual  storage  server 
cannot  be  contacted.  1.5  Open.  Google  platforms  for  cloud  computing  environment  is  a  private  environment,  in 
addition  to  the  application  program  interface  open  limited,  such  as  GWT  (GoogleWebtoolkit),  except  for 
GoogleAppEngine and GoogleMapAPI, Google and no cloud computing internal infrastructure sharing to external 
users  to  use  it.  IBM's  "blue  cloud  computing  platform  is  soft,"  the  set  of  hardware  available  for  sale,  the  soft, 
hardware  products  to  build  their  own  cloud  computing  applications  based  on  Amazon  elastic  cloud  computing  is 
managed  cloud  computing  platform,  users  can  remote  operating  direct  manipulation  user  interface,  not  to  see  the 
actual physical node [5]. From the perspective of the other differences is between the cloud computing systems. It 
can be seen that, although cloud computing systems are common in  many  ways, but in fact each system still has 
very big different, it also calculates the user or developer to cloud brought different experience. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  is  to  deepen  the  application  based  on  the  Internet,  the  Internet  of  things  technology,  analysis 
technology  by  using  the  advanced  information  collection,  information  processing,  information  flow,  information 
management,  intelligent,  completed  intelligent  transportation,  warehousing,  distribution,  packaging,  handling  a 
number of links, and the real-time feedback flow, enhanced flow monitoring, enables fast efficient delivery to the 
demand from the suppliers, so as to provide maximum profits for the supplier, to provide the most efficient service 
for  the  demand  side,  greatly  reduce  the  consumption  of  natural  resources  and  social  resources,  maximize  the 
protection of the natural ecological environment. 
 
3. Application of Internet of Things RFID in Intelligent Logistics System 
Internet of things through the sensor, RFID technology, mobile phone, GPS and other equipment, all objects in the 
world are connected to the information network, fully embodies the integration of physical space and information 
space,  but  also  provides  to  the  matter,  to  complex,  interconnected  relationship  between  person  and  person,  thus 
reducing the. Information systems and physical distance in the world, to construct coverage of all things in the world 
of "Internet of Things", one of its core technologies is the RFID technology. 
 
RFID reader is a wireless transmitting and receiving equipment, mainly including the RF module and digital signal 
processing  unit  2  part  of  read  and  write  operations,  label,  reader  demodulate  and  decode  the  received  radio 
frequency signal, and then sent to the application system through network. So it has a strong ability of storage and 
computation. 
 
Although RFID is fast in every field, but with respect to our country economy of scale, the scope of its application is 
still far from achieving wide degree, even in the transport and logistics industry RFID application more and more, 
and also at the point distribution state, and can not reach the surface state. Often is the industry leading enterprises to 
maintain  its  competitive  position  and  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  use  this  kind  of  new  technology,  more  and  more 
enterprises have a wait-and-see attitude and hesitation. Or to the logistics industry as an example, the application of 
RFID  technology  can  greatly  improve  the  operation  efficiency  of  logistics,  such  as  speeding  up  the  goods  out  of 
storage  time,  reduce  the  field  operation  personnel,  realize  accurate  inventory  fast  and  accurate  positioning,  cargo 
tracking [6].

In recent years, electronic label application in some practical, such as logistics management, process management, 
industrial air parcel quay container management etc.. At present, in addition to the actual carrier container source 
box, non vessel carrier is a part of the box and the owner owned box, the rest for the container leasing company 
case. The actual carrier is Ship Company, train, car, all aircraft; they control the transportation [7]. The non vessel 
carrier  is  in  container  transportation,  management  of  container  freight  canvassing,  packing,  detaining,  inland 
transportation and business to business or inland war, but not the operation of ships. 
 
The  reader  and  tag  data  information  is  the  main  threat  to  the  RFID  network  system  security  by  using  the  soft 
hardware. Application of RFID technology in the system general design, usually attack methods are: information, 
forgery, tampering with information, information playback interruption of information, as well as the illegal tracking 
tags, interferes with the normal work of the reader and the tag, as is shown by equation() the interception of tag data 
transfer information.

authentication process, at least to access these data area one, therefore, can use the signal probe monitoring on the 
bus access to important data. For good design, simple repeated authentication is not enough to the key position of 
access  memory  all.  For  example,  use  a  different  encryption  key  and  encryption  algorithm  in  the  same  card,  then 
every few weeks in between them to switch to a storage area of the chip, the algorithm and the key without being

according  to  temporal  relations,  transfer,  data  to  realize  the  energy.  There  are  two  types  of  coupling  RF  signal 
between reader and tag. (1) Inductively coupled. The transformer model, achieved by coupling space high frequency 
alternating  magnetic  field,  is  based  on  law  of  electromagnetic  induction.  (2)  The  electromagnetic  backscattering 
coupling: the principle of radar model, electromagnetic waves transmitted, met the target reflection, and carried back 
to the target information, is based on the law of propagation of electromagnetic wave. 
 
Public  logistics  information  platform  is  to  provide  international  logistics  information  service  for  international 
logistics, international logistics needs of enterprises and other relevant departments of the public business platform. 
Its  essence  is  to  support  and  guarantee  for  international  logistics  information  means  of  production.  The 
establishment of public logistics information platform can achieve rapid response to customer. The modern social 
economy  is  a  service  economy  society.  Establish  customer  rapid  response  system  is  the  basis  of  international 
logistics  enterprises  to  better  customer  service.  The  establishment  of  public  logistics  information  platform  can 
strengthen cooperation with partners.

In logistics, goods or goods of information recorded in the tray box label. This barcode system can clear information 
about their location, cargo tray and even individual identity, history, goods transportation destination, validity and 
other useful information [8]. Bar code system can provide detailed data for the goods in the supply chain, and the 
establishment of physical contact between the goods and the integrity of the identity, the user can easily access the 
reliable  information  goods.  And  through  the  data  acquisition  of  bar  code  efficient,  it  is  timely  logistics  and 
warehousing information feedback to production and processing, to guide the production. 
 
If the container transfer mode in theory, each circulation partly responsible for all abide by the original rules, then 
the container can be timely recovery, but the fact is not such as we desire, container, container damage caused by the 
recovery is not timely situation exists. For example, if the goods transfer mode is CY - CY, namely from the carrier 
at  the  port  of  loading  container  yard  to  the  carrier  at  the  port  of  discharge  of  the  container  yard.  If  in  strict 
accordance with the regulations, the carrier should be at the port of container yard will container deranging, will the 
delivery of the goods from the container and pulled out, and then the handing over of the goods to the consignee or 
his agent. 
 
Basic data management, logistics and integration, the key lies in the processing of massive data, the upstream and 
downstream information  sharing, data sources, to ensure the reliability and  security, provide the data  storage and 
backup, access to different application system. RFID data is described by the standard format (such as XML based, 
RDF etc.). A middleware standard, follow the standards development, universal adapter, emphasizes the modularity, 
provide  two  times  the  development  interface,  applications  of  different  RFID;  according  to  the  characteristics  of 
RFID, RFID data  model definitions, joined the RFID interface, access to the enterprise application system. RFID 
data cannot be filtered out, the historical data is very important, the middleware filters to establish a data filtering 
rules, can be used for the public information service. 
 
4. Build Intelligent Logistics System based on Internet of Things RFID in Platform of Cloud Computing 
RFID is an automatic identification technique of non-contact radio frequency communication to achieve. The RFID 
tag has the advantages of small volume, large capacity, long life and reusable characteristics, can support fast read 
and write, multi object recognition, non visual recognition, mobile recognition, positioning and long-term follow-up 
management. 
 
The  hardware  platform  is  commonly  known  as  the  Iaas,  which  mainly  provide  user  virtual  computing  resources, 
storage resources, cyber source. All hardware facilities including servers, network equipment, storage equipment, it 
is cloud computing data center [9]. The hardware platform must first have the scalability (Scaling), the user can be 
assumed that the hardware resources infinite. 
 
According to their own needs, user dynamic use of these resources, and to pay the service fee according to usage. 
Need not to need to buy equipment to support the current maintenance visits. In the virtual technology to design a 
hardware platform is  very important, it can share a large  hardware facilities allow  multiple operating  system, the 
hardware  platform  provider  can  provide  all  kinds  of  cloud  platform  hardware  requirements.  Virtual  technology 
common charges (such as: VMware), is a free open source technology (such as: Xen) the cloud platform to Paas, it 
provides service development tools and software (such as: database, distributed operating system, etc.) to help the 
developers to develop service cloud services. In addition, it is also a cloud service platform. Therefore, the cloud 
platform needs to have the Java runtime, Web2.0 application runtime, all kinds of middleware. 
 
Collaborative sharing platform of the system through the Internet of things, the enterprise can be carried out between 
the  logistics  share  cooperative  distribution  and  storage:  logistics  enterprises  based  on  cooperation  between 
effectively  freight  information  sharing,  resource  sharing  to  realize  collaborative  freight,  delivery;  between  supply 
chain  enterprises  will  storage  resource  sharing  in  the  whole  supply  chain  scope,  an  enterprise  can  use  the  supply 
other enterprises on the chain storage resources, improve the efficiency of transportation and distribution. 
 
Cloud  computing  operating  system  usually  contains  the  following  modules:  modules  large-scale  infrastructure 
software and hardware management, virtual management of computing, distributed file system, business / resource 
scheduling management, safety management control. Build intelligent logistics system based on Internet of things 
RFID with cloud computing is figure1. In simple terms, the cloud operating system has the following functions, one 
is treated as the control of a few, can manage and drive the massive server, storage hardware, the hardware resource 
logic of a data center is integrated into a server; two is to provide a unified, standard for cloud application software 
interface is calculated; three task management of massive and resource allocation.

INTRODUCTION 

 

In IOT application services through sharing the same huge cloud computing resource pool to obtain large system 
throughput capacity to meet user needs in some cases of ultra high computation or storage resource request, and the 
cost  is  the  total  amount  of  use  of  resources  costs  [1].  Dynamic  expansion  and  contraction  process  of  the  above 
system does not require user intervention, the system will automatically, developers on its platform but according to 
the  standard  and  follow  the  procedure  is  easy  to  be  extended  principle,  with  not  much  difference  between  the 
development of local application, the system developers and users have brought a lot of benefits, and the operator 
can also be middleware services the core link control firmly. 
 
The work principle of RFID is: label into the field, if the received reader special RF signals, can with the induced 
current obtained by the energy sending out the product information stored in the chips (i.e. Passive Tag, passive tags 
or passive tags), or take the initiative to send signals to send a frequency (i.e. Active Tag, active tags or active tags), 
the reader reads information and decoded, sent to the central information system on the data processing. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  system  is  mainly  to  achieve  the  following  two  objectives:  To  carry  on  the  business  process 
reengineering  of  logistics  enterprise  itself  (Business  Process  Re-Engineering,  BPR),  the  traditional  logistics 
enterprise  management  and  business  process  has  been  changed  fundamentally,  so  that  it  can  survive  in  the 
information society. In the EC operating environment, providing value-added logistics services have not provide for 
the customer, the value-added logistics services will enhance the convenience of logistics services, to accelerate the 
reaction speed and reduce the service cost, extended enterprises downstream in the supply chain of the business. 
 
Using the technology of RFID network in the world all items together, can be "communication between each other 
and articles". RFID tags are stored in the items of information, the reader information obtained through wireless data 
communication network automatic acquisition to the central information system, to realize the goods identification;

through the computer network to realize the sharing and exchange of information. That is to say the world through 
RFID  and  other  information  sensing  did  not  have  connected  to  the  Internet,  and  eventually  realize  intelligent 
identification and management. The Internet of things will become the sensor network based on RFID technology, 
the RFID technology of Internet of things based on system is composed of the physical world and the logic space 
composed of 2 levels. 
 
Transportation  costs  under  the  influence  of  economic  globalization,  the  increasingly  fierce  competition.  How  to 
configure  and  use  of  resources  and  it  is  reduce  manufacturing  cost  and  enterprises  to  focus  on  the  problem.  To 
implement this strategy, not a highly advanced, reliable and efficient logistics system is unable to realize. With the 
development of economic globalization and the rise of network economy, the logistics function is no longer simple 
in  order  to  reduce  the  cost,  but  rather  becomes  improve  customer  service  quality  to  enhance  the  comprehensive 
competitiveness of enterprises. At present, the logistics industry is gradually formed seven development trends, they 
are  respectively  and  the  third  party  logistics  cooperative  information,  intelligence,  environmental  protection, 
enterprise  globalization  and  internationalization,  service  quality,  industry.  The  paper  presents  build  intelligent 
logistics system based on Internet of things RFID in the platform of cloud computing. 
 
2. Design of Intelligent Logistics System based on Platform of Cloud Computing 
SDK provides application development tools in the cloud platform, similar to the traditional API development, but 
here the SDK is a customized, provide the interface of application service cloud computing platform architecture. 
The main purpose of SDK is to provide enterprises to meet the personalized needs of IT. In the current enterprise 
management software model, when enterprises need some personalized software, technical department will take this 
application  to  the  server.  If  there  is  a  cloud  computing  platform  to  provide  services,  enterprises  can  develop 
personalized application by using SDK. 
 
Logistics  in  the  field  of  cloud  computing,  can  let  the  logistics  enterprises  according  to  the  actual  size  and  its 
requirements; dynamically select the corresponding visual resources and services on the Internet cloud, so as to meet 
the need of the enterprise in the daily operations in the process of the IT service. IBM wisdom "logistics cloud" put 
forward a similar concept [2]. It provides a cloud based intelligent logistics plan, can put the things used in logistics, 
intelligence will progress cargo handling, transport, storage, maintenance and customs clearance, logistics industry, 
fast efficient, intensive, transparent, save the management cost, improve the management level. 
 
SDK provides support for enterprise application basic API, including storage service, queue service, authentication 
service  etc..  In  addition  also  provides  the  ability  to  invoke  the  Web  Service  and  packaged  into  Web  Service  for 
external calls. Problems and countermeasures have been, security problems are restricting the development of cloud 
computing, cloud computing is the biggest obstacle in the implementation of enterprises. This paper summarizes the 
security platform facing and puts forward the corresponding countermeasures, as is shown by equation1.

build and run the software services at the same time, on the other hand, it is responsible for the management of all 
hardware  and  software  resources,  through  the  Internet  to  provide  on-demand,  based  on  Web  software  solutions. 
PaaS provides all the required for the operation of the Internet application infrastructure. Users only need to "open 
water"  to  obtain  the  service,  they  don't  have  to  worry  about  behind  the  scenes  complexity.  PaaS  is  based  on  a 
subscription  model,  so  the  user  only  needs  to  pay  for  his  use  of  function.  Using  PaaS,  independent  software 
developers  and  enterprise  IT  departments  is  to  focus  more  on  innovation,  rather  than  the  complex  infrastructure. 
Logistics enterprises can budget more into can provide real value to the business place, rather than basic equipment 
purchase and maintenance. 
 
The Internet of things worth is not a network capable of sensing, but must all sectors involved application, different 
industries,  will  have  different  application,  will  have  different  requirements,  these  must  be  based  on  the 
characteristics of the industry, for the development of in-depth study and valuable. This application development can 
not  rely  on  the  operator;  can  not  just  rely  on  the  so-called  Internet  enterprise,  because  operators  and  technology 
companies are unable to understand the requirements of the industry and the industry specific.

In  cloud  computing  platform  of  general  data  through  the  Internet  transmission,  data  by  the  cloud  service 
management need to keep the security of the data, including the calculation and data backup of the data on the server 
[3]. Generally speaking, the enterprise data security requirements, such as customer information, contract bidding 
rules. But the enterprise the data submitted to the cloud computing platform, enterprises will lose control of the data, 
unable to ensure the security of the data, increase the likelihood that data is leaked. 
 
The  logistics  department  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  shipper  sales  invoice  generation  Chukuchan: 
according to the outbound priority (such as the date of production priority  from the  front) query outbound  goods 
storage bin and inventory status to the  warehouse,  such as customer specified  number specified batch query, and 
outbound goods delivery into position and the corresponding tray of goods. Picking a person carrying out of order to 
the  warehouse  manager,  and  it  is  warehouse  keeper  check  information  for  executing  the  corresponding  product

At present, the Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Sun companies such as cloud computing infrastructure or cloud 
computing  platform,  open  source  organizations  and  academic  circles  have  put  forward  many  cloud  computing 
system or platform. The Google cloud computing infrastructure Google cloud computing infrastructure in the initial

system  reliability,  availability,  skeptical,  worried  about  the  timely  resolution  of  problems  can  not  be  services, 
comprehensive application and so on have affected the enterprise cloud computing. To solve this problem, it can 
introduce SLA service level agreement to provide reliable service to the user. At the same time, SLA can further 
constraints  on  the  cloud  service  provider,  improve  service  quality;  I  can  increase  the  enterprise  users  of  cloud 
services of confidence. 
 
Sun's cloud infrastructure architecture, including service application, middleware, operating system, virtual server, 
physical server and so on 6 levels, the proposed "cloud computing can be described from hardware to any traditional 
hierarchical  application  services"  point  of  view.  The  Azure  cloud  platform  of  Microsoft  includes  4  levels.  The 
bottom  layer  is  Microsoft  Global  Foundation  Services  System  (globalfoundationservice,  GFS),  from  all  over  the 
world  the  fourth  generation  data  center;  cloud  infrastructure  service  layer  (cloudinfrastructureservice)  on  the 
WindowsAzure operating system as the core, mainly engaged in virtualized computing resource management and 
intelligent  task  allocation;  WindowsAzure  is  an  application  service  platform,  it  plays  a  member  (BuildingBlock) 
function, provides a range of services for users. 
 
The  third  party  logistics  enterprise,  the  span  of  regional  storage  location  is  great,  and  therefore  need  to  network 
distributed storage management and inventory control technology to reduce management costs, improve efficiency. 
Network  distributed  storage  management  and  inventory  control  technology  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ILS  [4]. 
Distributed storage  management and inventory control  module is a part, ERP software at present, relatively large 
ERP system, such as SAP R/3 including the module. In order to ensure consistency, that is established in the local

problem of infinite growth, allows the IT infrastructure to realize resource and service, so that users can customize 
according to need, thus changing the traditional IT infrastructure delivery and payment. 
 
Many  cloud  computing  deployment  depends  on  the  computer  cluster  (but  with  grid  composition,  architecture, 
working  mode,  to  be  quite  different),  also  absorbed  the  characteristics  of  autonomic  computing  and  utility 
computing. In a large number of distributed computers through the calculation, rather than the local computer or a 
remote server, enterprise data center operation will be more similar with the internet. This makes the enterprise can 
be  resource  switch  on  the  application  of  need,  demand  according  to  visit  the  computer  and  storage  system.  Like 
from  a  single  generator  model  ancient  to  power  plant  centralized  power  supply  mode.  It  means  that  computing 
power  can  also  be  used  as  a kind  of  commodity  circulation,  like  gas,  hydropower,  and  convenient  use,  low  cost. 
Biggest difference lies in that; it is to be transmitted through the internet.                     
                                                             
The cloud computing platforms have their own different characteristics. Especially in the platform use, transparent 
computing  platform  for  the  user  and  provides  a  client  node  user  actual  contact  and  remote  virtual  storage  server 
cannot  be  contacted.  1.5  Open.  Google  platforms  for  cloud  computing  environment  is  a  private  environment,  in 
addition  to  the  application  program  interface  open  limited,  such  as  GWT  (GoogleWebtoolkit),  except  for 
GoogleAppEngine and GoogleMapAPI, Google and no cloud computing internal infrastructure sharing to external 
users  to  use  it.  IBM's  "blue  cloud  computing  platform  is  soft,"  the  set  of  hardware  available  for  sale,  the  soft, 
hardware  products  to  build  their  own  cloud  computing  applications  based  on  Amazon  elastic  cloud  computing  is 
managed  cloud  computing  platform,  users  can  remote  operating  direct  manipulation  user  interface,  not  to  see  the 
actual physical node [5]. From the perspective of the other differences is between the cloud computing systems. It 
can be seen that, although cloud computing systems are common in  many  ways, but in fact each system still has 
very big different, it also calculates the user or developer to cloud brought different experience. 
 
Intelligent  logistics  is  to  deepen  the  application  based  on  the  Internet,  the  Internet  of  things  technology,  analysis 
technology  by  using  the  advanced  information  collection,  information  processing,  information  flow,  information 
management,  intelligent,  completed  intelligent  transportation,  warehousing,  distribution,  packaging,  handling  a 
number of links, and the real-time feedback flow, enhanced flow monitoring, enables fast efficient delivery to the 
demand from the suppliers, so as to provide maximum profits for the supplier, to provide the most efficient service 
for  the  demand  side,  greatly  reduce  the  consumption  of  natural  resources  and  social  resources,  maximize  the 
protection of the natural ecological environment. 
 
3. Application of Internet of Things RFID in Intelligent Logistics System 
Internet of things through the sensor, RFID technology, mobile phone, GPS and other equipment, all objects in the 
world are connected to the information network, fully embodies the integration of physical space and information 
space,  but  also  provides  to  the  matter,  to  complex,  interconnected  relationship  between  person  and  person,  thus 
reducing the. Information systems and physical distance in the world, to construct coverage of all things in the world 
of "Internet of Things", one of its core technologies is the RFID technology. 
 
RFID reader is a wireless transmitting and receiving equipment, mainly including the RF module and digital signal 
processing  unit  2  part  of  read  and  write  operations,  label,  reader  demodulate  and  decode  the  received  radio 
frequency signal, and then sent to the application system through network. So it has a strong ability of storage and 
computation. 
 
Although RFID is fast in every field, but with respect to our country economy of scale, the scope of its application is 
still far from achieving wide degree, even in the transport and logistics industry RFID application more and more, 
and also at the point distribution state, and can not reach the surface state. Often is the industry leading enterprises to 
maintain  its  competitive  position  and  take  the  lead  in  trying  to  use  this  kind  of  new  technology,  more  and  more 
enterprises have a wait-and-see attitude and hesitation. Or to the logistics industry as an example, the application of 
RFID  technology  can  greatly  improve  the  operation  efficiency  of  logistics,  such  as  speeding  up  the  goods  out  of 
storage  time,  reduce  the  field  operation  personnel,  realize  accurate  inventory  fast  and  accurate  positioning,  cargo 
tracking [6].

In recent years, electronic label application in some practical, such as logistics management, process management, 
industrial air parcel quay container management etc.. At present, in addition to the actual carrier container source 
box, non vessel carrier is a part of the box and the owner owned box, the rest for the container leasing company 
case. The actual carrier is Ship Company, train, car, all aircraft; they control the transportation [7]. The non vessel 
carrier  is  in  container  transportation,  management  of  container  freight  canvassing,  packing,  detaining,  inland 
transportation and business to business or inland war, but not the operation of ships. 
 
The  reader  and  tag  data  information  is  the  main  threat  to  the  RFID  network  system  security  by  using  the  soft 
hardware. Application of RFID technology in the system general design, usually attack methods are: information, 
forgery, tampering with information, information playback interruption of information, as well as the illegal tracking 
tags, interferes with the normal work of the reader and the tag, as is shown by equation() the interception of tag data 
transfer information.

authentication process, at least to access these data area one, therefore, can use the signal probe monitoring on the 
bus access to important data. For good design, simple repeated authentication is not enough to the key position of 
access  memory  all.  For  example,  use  a  different  encryption  key  and  encryption  algorithm  in  the  same  card,  then 
every few weeks in between them to switch to a storage area of the chip, the algorithm and the key without being

according  to  temporal  relations,  transfer,  data  to  realize  the  energy.  There  are  two  types  of  coupling  RF  signal 
between reader and tag. (1) Inductively coupled. The transformer model, achieved by coupling space high frequency 
alternating  magnetic  field,  is  based  on  law  of  electromagnetic  induction.  (2)  The  electromagnetic  backscattering 
coupling: the principle of radar model, electromagnetic waves transmitted, met the target reflection, and carried back 
to the target information, is based on the law of propagation of electromagnetic wave. 
 
Public  logistics  information  platform  is  to  provide  international  logistics  information  service  for  international 
logistics, international logistics needs of enterprises and other relevant departments of the public business platform. 
Its  essence  is  to  support  and  guarantee  for  international  logistics  information  means  of  production.  The 
establishment of public logistics information platform can achieve rapid response to customer. The modern social 
economy  is  a  service  economy  society.  Establish  customer  rapid  response  system  is  the  basis  of  international 
logistics  enterprises  to  better  customer  service.  The  establishment  of  public  logistics  information  platform  can 
strengthen cooperation with partners.

In logistics, goods or goods of information recorded in the tray box label. This barcode system can clear information 
about their location, cargo tray and even individual identity, history, goods transportation destination, validity and 
other useful information [8]. Bar code system can provide detailed data for the goods in the supply chain, and the 
establishment of physical contact between the goods and the integrity of the identity, the user can easily access the 
reliable  information  goods.  And  through  the  data  acquisition  of  bar  code  efficient,  it  is  timely  logistics  and 
warehousing information feedback to production and processing, to guide the production. 
 
If the container transfer mode in theory, each circulation partly responsible for all abide by the original rules, then 
the container can be timely recovery, but the fact is not such as we desire, container, container damage caused by the 
recovery is not timely situation exists. For example, if the goods transfer mode is CY - CY, namely from the carrier 
at  the  port  of  loading  container  yard  to  the  carrier  at  the  port  of  discharge  of  the  container  yard.  If  in  strict 
accordance with the regulations, the carrier should be at the port of container yard will container deranging, will the 
delivery of the goods from the container and pulled out, and then the handing over of the goods to the consignee or 
his agent. 
 
Basic data management, logistics and integration, the key lies in the processing of massive data, the upstream and 
downstream information  sharing, data sources, to ensure the reliability and  security, provide the data  storage and 
backup, access to different application system. RFID data is described by the standard format (such as XML based, 
RDF etc.). A middleware standard, follow the standards development, universal adapter, emphasizes the modularity, 
provide  two  times  the  development  interface,  applications  of  different  RFID;  according  to  the  characteristics  of 
RFID, RFID data  model definitions, joined the RFID interface, access to the enterprise application system. RFID 
data cannot be filtered out, the historical data is very important, the middleware filters to establish a data filtering 
rules, can be used for the public information service.

RFID is an automatic identification technique of non-contact radio frequency communication to achieve. The RFID 
tag has the advantages of small volume, large capacity, long life and reusable characteristics, can support fast read 
and write, multi object recognition, non visual recognition, mobile recognition, positioning and long-term follow-up 
management. 
 
The  hardware  platform  is  commonly  known  as  the  Iaas,  which  mainly  provide  user  virtual  computing  resources, 
storage resources, cyber source. All hardware facilities including servers, network equipment, storage equipment, it 
is cloud computing data center [9]. The hardware platform must first have the scalability (Scaling), the user can be 
assumed that the hardware resources infinite. 
 
According to their own needs, user dynamic use of these resources, and to pay the service fee according to usage. 
Need not to need to buy equipment to support the current maintenance visits. In the virtual technology to design a 
hardware platform is  very important, it can share a large  hardware facilities allow  multiple operating  system, the 
hardware  platform  provider  can  provide  all  kinds  of  cloud  platform  hardware  requirements.  Virtual  technology 
common charges (such as: VMware), is a free open source technology (such as: Xen) the cloud platform to Paas, it 
provides service development tools and software (such as: database, distributed operating system, etc.) to help the 
developers to develop service cloud services. In addition, it is also a cloud service platform. Therefore, the cloud 
platform needs to have the Java runtime, Web2.0 application runtime, all kinds of middleware. 
 
Collaborative sharing platform of the system through the Internet of things, the enterprise can be carried out between 
the  logistics  share  cooperative  distribution  and  storage:  logistics  enterprises  based  on  cooperation  between 
effectively  freight  information  sharing,  resource  sharing  to  realize  collaborative  freight,  delivery;  between  supply 
chain  enterprises  will  storage  resource  sharing  in  the  whole  supply  chain  scope,  an  enterprise  can  use  the  supply 
other enterprises on the chain storage resources, improve the efficiency of transportation and distribution. 
 
Cloud  computing  operating  system  usually  contains  the  following  modules:  modules  large-scale  infrastructure 
software and hardware management, virtual management of computing, distributed file system, business / resource 
scheduling management, safety management control. Build intelligent logistics system based on Internet of things 
RFID with cloud computing is figure1. In simple terms, the cloud operating system has the following functions, one 
is treated as the control of a few, can manage and drive the massive server, storage hardware, the hardware resource 
logic of a data center is integrated into a server; two is to provide a unified, standard for cloud application software 
interface is calculated; three task management of massive and resource allocation.

Now  RFID  technology  in  logistics  system  is  widely  used  as  the  Internet  of  things,  the  core  technology  plays  an 
important  role  in  the  field  of  logistics  management.  The  EPC  code  is  stored  in  the  RFID  tag,  can  realize  the 
identification of the real target, some real-time dynamic information at the same time label also stores the real target 
and may be updated, high-level information processing software can pass the RFID reader to identify, transmission 
and query of the target information. Compared and the now widespread use of bar code technology, RFID has the 
advantages of read and write long distance, high security, large amount of stored data, the use of harsh environment, 
long  service  life  etc..  RFID  can  be  used  to  track  and  manage  almost  all  physical  objects,  is  one  of  the  important 
means  of  informationization  of  logistics  management,  tracking  and  other  fields,  and  has  a  very  important  role  to 
improve the intelligent level of logistics. Through virtualization, cloud computing platform can be very flexible to 
meet various needs, not by hardware limitations.   
 
Computing hardware platform in the realization of their cloud, which takes into account the storage structure, which 
not only need to consider the storage capacity, more important is the need to consider disk data read and write speed. 
The rate of a single disk is likely to limit the service program for data access, so in the actual process, data needs to 
be distributed to multiple disks, and through the multiple simultaneous disk read and write in order to improve the 
speed of it. 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
Cloud computing users can through the network access to resources on demand, and pay per use, like to turn on the 
light  electricity,  turn  on  the  tap  water,  access  is  used;  from  the  background,  cloud  computing  can  realize  the 
compatibility  of  various  heterogeneous  hardware  and  software  resources  on  the  basis  of  dynamic  circulation,  to 
achieve  resource.  The  paper  presents  build  intelligent  logistics  system  based  on  Internet  of  things  RFID  in  the 
platform  of  cloud  computing.  The  static,  fixed  hardware  resource  scheduling,  forming  a  pool  of  resources,  the 
realization of the two basic functions of the cloud is Cloud Computing Center operating system, but the important 
role of the operating system is far more than that.
