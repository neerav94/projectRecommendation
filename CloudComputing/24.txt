Abstract:  The  introduction  and  continuous  development  of  information  and  communication  technologies  has  made 
governments  across  the  globe  realize  their  potential  benefits.  Although  the  computerization  of  departments  has 
enhanced  the  efficiency  with  which  information  is  handled  and  processed,  it  comes  at  a  large  cost  in  terms  of 
infrastructure, skilled personnel and user reluctance. Whenever there is a change or update in technology, there arises a 
major need to update the infrastructure, skill set as well as the user perspective. Its not always possible to carry out such 
hugely expensive changes every time there is a technology update. Leaving aside the under-developed ones, even the 
developed countries would not afford to risk their resources for such tasks every now and then. In this paper, we take 
up  the  issue  from  a  cloud  based  computing  perspective  and  propose  a  cloud  framework  for  the  Indian  National  e-
Governance Plan (NeGP) to ensure interoperability functionality among different states and to see the benefits such as - 
reduce the operating costs, provide greater reliability, transparency and sustainability while using latest technologies.

“E-Government”  refers 
the  use  by  government 
agencies, of information technologies (such as Wide Area 
Networks,  the  Internet,  mobile  computing)  that  have  the 
ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and 
other arms of government. These technologies can serve a 
variety  of  different  ends:  better  delivery  of  government 
services  to  citizens,  improved  interactions  with  business 
and  industry,  citizen  empowerment  through  access  to

INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing is a relatively new business model in the 
computing  world.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  official  definition, 
"cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction." [2]

infrastructure),  and 

tenets  of  Cloud  computing  are 

The  definition  lists  five  essential  characteristics  of  cloud 
computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity  or  expansion,  and 
measured  service.  It  also  lists  three  "service  models" 
(software,  platform  and 
four 
"deployment  models"  (private,  community,  public  and 
hybrid)  that  together  categorize  ways  to  deliver  cloud 
services. In this paper, we take up the cloud characteristics 
and services in greater detail. 
 
The  main 
instant 
availability  of  services,  pay-per-use  model,  increased 
reliability and massive scalability. Following are the main 
characteristics: 
 
  On Demand Self Service: The consumer can make use 
of  the  computing  resources  such  as  processor  time, 
storage  or  bandwidth  as  and  when  required,  without 
the  need  of  any  human  involvement  with 
the 
service/resource  provider.  The  government  related 
processes, in a traditional manner, take some time for 
the  processing  of  such  requests  and  the  delay  caused 
may lead to loss  of productivity. The cloud approach 
reduces this delay substantially. 

  Broad Network Access: The consumer can access the 
cloud  services 
through  a  variety  of  channels 
irrespective  of  the  platform,  architecture  or  the 
operating  system.  The  same  content  can  be  accessed 
via a mobile phone, workstation or a laptop. The only 
requirement  is  of  connecting  to  the  cloud  and  once 
you  are  there,  you  have  virtual  access  to  the  huge 
cloud resources at your convenience. The government 
agencies and personnel need not be always present at 
their workstations. Rather, they carry their entire work 
over  the  cloud  wherever  and  whenever  there  is  a 
requirement. 

  Resource  Pooling:  The  cloud  service  provider  pools 
the computing resources to serve multiple consumers 
at multiple locations. There is dynamic allocation and 
de-allocation  of  resources  according  to  consumer 
demand,  independent  of  the  consumer  location.  The 
government  agencies  can  free 
themselves  from 
botheration  of  having  limited  resources  such  as 
storage,  network  bandwidth,  processing  speed  etc. 
They  can  rather  focus  more  on  the  productivity  and 
efficiency  of  their  operations  assuming  they  have 
unlimited  resources  at  their  disposal,  when  operating 
over the cloud. 

  Rapid  Elasticity:  The  cloud  has 

the  ability 

to 
manipulate  its  resources  among  the  consumers  based 
on  the  user  demand.  The  scaling  capacity  is  so 
efficient  and  rapid  that  the  resources  appear  to  be 
unlimited  for  provision  of  the  user  and  can  be 
appropriated  in  any  quantity  at  any  time.  The 
government  departments  can  scale  up  the  scope  for 
any  of  their  projects  without  giving much  thought to 
the resource constraints. 

  Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  the  resource  usage  by  leveraging  a  metering 
capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction  appropriate  to 
the 
(e.g.,  storage,  processing, 

type  of  service 

bandwidth, and active user accounts) being accessed. 
Resource  usage  can  be  monitored,  controlled  and 
reported,  providing  greater 
transparency.  The 
government  agencies  can  control  and  keep  check  on 
the  amount  of  services  being  used  by  each  of  its 
employees,  thus  providing  greater  transparency  and 
preventing  misuse  of  resources.  This  can  easily  be 
accomplished as whenever a person wishes to use the 
cloud  services,  he/she  is  first  authenticated  and  then 
logged for every activity performed. 

 
Fig.  2  shows  how  the  cloud  concept  can  be  used  to 
integrate  the  functioning  among  various  government 
agencies and departments.

Following  are  the  different  services  provided  through  the 
cloud platform: 


Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability  to

provide 
resources 
processing,  storage,  networking  etc,  where 
the 
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software 
that  can  include  operating  systems  and  applications. 
The  consumer  does  not  have 
to  bother  about 
managing  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  but has 
control over the deployed applications. 

  E-Governance

requires 

infrastructure 
availability  with  minimum  downtime.  Application 
designers can focus more on the features and usability 
instead of worrying about the scalability, platform and 
infrastructure  requirements  when  they  design  for  the 
cloud.  Hardware  maintenance  is  greatly  reduced  on 
part of the government, which can then divert more of 
its attention towards enhancing the quality of software 
and  thereby  providing  better  quality  services  to  the 
consumers.

underlying  cloud  infrastructure  including  network, 
servers, operating systems  or storage, but has control

Going  through  the  basics,  we  can  have  the  following 
advantages using the cloud platform: 
 
  Availability: The cloud is responsible to provide 24x7 
access  of  its  service  uptime  to  the  consumers.  The 
government agencies can get benefitted in a way that 
they  do  not  have  to  maintain  the  infrastructure  and 
hence  no  delays  in  the  delivery  of  services  to  the 
users. 

  Disaster  Recovery:  The  cloud  service  providers 
generally  maintain  their  data  centers  at  multiple 
locations  that  are  geographically  distributed.  In  case 
of  any  natural  calamity,  the  data  can  be  well 
recovered  as  multiple  copies  are  being  maintained. 
The  important  documents  need  not  be  taken  care  of 
from  a  physical  storage  point  of  view  by  the 
government agencies. 

  Transparency:  As  the  cloud  provides  measurable 
services,  activities  of  the  users  can  be  well  audited 
against any type of misuse. This also helps provide a 
mechanism  against  corruption.  There  can  be  no 
unnecessary delays in the processing of documents. 

  Updation  of  Technology:  Change  is  an  inevitable 
process.  The  government  has  to  handle  many  costs 
(software, network bandwidth, personnel training etc.) 
whenever  there  is  a  change  or  update  in  technology. 
Such  costs  can  be  greatly  reduced  on  part  of  the 
government if these considerations are handled by the 
cloud provider.

government  estimates  say  that,  if  two  or  more  states 
consume  IT-as-a-service  using  the  private  Cloud 
model, it could save the exchequer almost 50% of the 
Rs.  1,378  crore  allocated  for  the  state  data  center 
projects [4].

same software at multiple workstations in the various 
departments,  a  huge  amount  of  recurring  cost  is 
involved in the name of Software Licensing fee which 
is  renewed  after  some  period  of  time.  In  the  cloud 
concept, one does not have to purchase the license for 
every  software  that  is  to  be  used.  Just  a  usage  fee  is 
charged for the time the software is being accessed by

Abstract:  The  introduction  and  continuous  development  of  information  and  communication  technologies  has  made 
governments  across  the  globe  realize  their  potential  benefits.  Although  the  computerization  of  departments  has 
enhanced  the  efficiency  with  which  information  is  handled  and  processed,  it  comes  at  a  large  cost  in  terms  of 
infrastructure, skilled personnel and user reluctance. Whenever there is a change or update in technology, there arises a 
major need to update the infrastructure, skill set as well as the user perspective. Its not always possible to carry out such 
hugely expensive changes every time there is a technology update. Leaving aside the under-developed ones, even the 
developed countries would not afford to risk their resources for such tasks every now and then. In this paper, we take 
up  the  issue  from  a  cloud  based  computing  perspective  and  propose  a  cloud  framework  for  the  Indian  National  e-
Governance Plan (NeGP) to ensure interoperability functionality among different states and to see the benefits such as - 
reduce the operating costs, provide greater reliability, transparency and sustainability while using latest technologies.

INTRODUCTION TO E-GOVERNANCE 

to 

“E-Government”  refers 
the  use  by  government 
agencies, of information technologies (such as Wide Area 
Networks,  the  Internet,  mobile  computing)  that  have  the 
ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and 
other arms of government. These technologies can serve a 
variety  of  different  ends:  better  delivery  of  government 
services  to  citizens,  improved  interactions  with  business 
and  industry,  citizen  empowerment  through  access  to 
information,  or  more  efficient  government  management 
[1]. The resulting benefits can be- increased transparency, 
greater  convenience,  revenue  growth,  cost  reductions, 
better efficiency and performance. 
 
Electronic  governance  is  all  about  using  the  information 
and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  to  transform  the 
traditional  government  operations  through  the  application 
of  faster, more  efficient mechanisms  which help  simplify 
the  administrative  processes  in  addition to  facilitating  the 
integration of services among different departments. 

 

Governments  have  innumerable  applications  that  can  be 
automated  to  increase  productivity  and  ease  the  decision-
making  and  policy  enforcement  processes  at  a  higher 
level. The various application areas of the government can 
be classified as follows: 
 
  Government to Government (G2G): Various functions 
of  the government  agencies  interact to  fulfill a  work, 
which  requires  a  high  degree  of  message  passing 
across  departments.  For  instance,  Administration 
Control, Employment Exchange 

  Government 

to  Business 

(G2B):  The  different 
government departments need to interact with various 
business  houses  in the  private  sector. The  conduct  of 
online 
regulatory 
processes,  therefore  helping  businesses  to  become 
more

tenders/e-procurement,  Tax  collection  and  related 
activities

 
Government  to  Citizen  (G2C):  A  number  of 
services  are  being  offered  by  the  government agencies  to 
the citizens that can range from a simple request resolution 
to  anything  useful  to  both  the  parties.  For  instance, 
Vehicle/Land Registration, License Issuing 
In  order  to  implement  these  functions  through  the 
traditional  mechanism,  it  is  required  by  each  of  the 
government  departments 
the 
required infrastructure as there is a more or less clear cut 
boundary between the operations of any two departments. 
The emphasis is more towards the computerization of the 
work processes at a departmental level as observed in the

INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing is a relatively new business model in the 
computing  world.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  official  definition, 
"cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction." [2]

infrastructure),  and 

tenets  of  Cloud  computing  are 

The  definition  lists  five  essential  characteristics  of  cloud 
computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity  or  expansion,  and 
measured  service.  It  also  lists  three  "service  models" 
(software,  platform  and 
four 
"deployment  models"  (private,  community,  public  and 
hybrid)  that  together  categorize  ways  to  deliver  cloud 
services. In this paper, we take up the cloud characteristics 
and services in greater detail. 
 
The  main 
instant 
availability  of  services,  pay-per-use  model,  increased 
reliability and massive scalability. Following are the main 
characteristics: 
 
  On Demand Self Service: The consumer can make use 
of  the  computing  resources  such  as  processor  time, 
storage  or  bandwidth  as  and  when  required,  without 
the  need  of  any  human  involvement  with 
the 
service/resource  provider.  The  government  related 
processes, in a traditional manner, take some time for 
the  processing  of  such  requests  and  the  delay  caused 
may lead to loss  of productivity. The cloud approach 
reduces this delay substantially. 

  Broad Network Access: The consumer can access the 
cloud  services 
through  a  variety  of  channels 
irrespective  of  the  platform,  architecture  or  the 
operating  system.  The  same  content  can  be  accessed 
via a mobile phone, workstation or a laptop. The only 
requirement  is  of  connecting  to  the  cloud  and  once 
you  are  there,  you  have  virtual  access  to  the  huge 
cloud resources at your convenience. The government 
agencies and personnel need not be always present at 
their workstations. Rather, they carry their entire work 
over  the  cloud  wherever  and  whenever  there  is  a 
requirement. 

  Resource  Pooling:  The  cloud  service  provider  pools 
the computing resources to serve multiple consumers 
at multiple locations. There is dynamic allocation and 
de-allocation  of  resources  according  to  consumer 
demand,  independent  of  the  consumer  location.  The 
government  agencies  can  free 
themselves  from 
botheration  of  having  limited  resources  such  as 
storage,  network  bandwidth,  processing  speed  etc. 
They  can  rather  focus  more  on  the  productivity  and 
efficiency  of  their  operations  assuming  they  have 
unlimited  resources  at  their  disposal,  when  operating 
over the cloud. 

  Rapid  Elasticity:  The  cloud  has 

the  ability 

to 
manipulate  its  resources  among  the  consumers  based 
on  the  user  demand.  The  scaling  capacity  is  so 
efficient  and  rapid  that  the  resources  appear  to  be 
unlimited  for  provision  of  the  user  and  can  be 
appropriated  in  any  quantity  at  any  time.  The 
government  departments  can  scale  up  the  scope  for 
any  of  their  projects  without  giving much  thought to 
the resource constraints. 

  Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  the  resource  usage  by  leveraging  a  metering 
capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction  appropriate  to 
the 
(e.g.,  storage,  processing, 

type  of  service 

bandwidth, and active user accounts) being accessed. 
Resource  usage  can  be  monitored,  controlled  and 
reported,  providing  greater 
transparency.  The 
government  agencies  can  control  and  keep  check  on 
the  amount  of  services  being  used  by  each  of  its 
employees,  thus  providing  greater  transparency  and 
preventing  misuse  of  resources.  This  can  easily  be 
accomplished as whenever a person wishes to use the 
cloud  services,  he/she  is  first  authenticated  and  then 
logged for every activity performed. 

 
Fig.  2  shows  how  the  cloud  concept  can  be  used  to 
integrate  the  functioning  among  various  government 
agencies and departments.

consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software 
that  can  include  operating  systems  and  applications. 
The  consumer  does  not  have 
to  bother  about 
managing  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  but has 
control over the deployed applications.

availability  with  minimum  downtime.  Application 
designers can focus more on the features and usability 
instead of worrying about the scalability, platform and 
infrastructure  requirements  when  they  design  for  the 
cloud.  Hardware  maintenance  is  greatly  reduced  on 
part of the government, which can then divert more of 
its attention towards enhancing the quality of software 
and  thereby  providing  better  quality  services  to  the 
consumers.

It helps  the  government agencies  to  plan and  control

  Scalability:  The  ability  of  the  cloud  architecture  to 
provide  rapid  scaling  helps  the  government  agencies 
in  a  great  deal  to  magnify  the  scope  of  their  projects 
without thinking much about resource pooling.

for  additional  air  conditioning  in  the  server  rooms

billion won (about $521 million) through 2014 to provide 
the  foundation  for  a  Web-based  computing  industry.  
According  to  the  initiative  announced  by  the  Korea 
Communications Commission (KCC), the country's media 
and  telecommunications  regulator,  much  of  the  planned 
spending is to be devoted to establishing cloud computing 
infrastructures and developing core technologies [7]. With 
this, the government intends to increase the Korean Cloud 
market share to 10% in the global marketplace and reduce 
the cost of public ICT infrastructure by 50%. 
 
In  the  US,  the  federal  government‟s  Chief  Information 
Officer  (CIO) has  given a mandate  that  every  department 
in every state should have at least two state applications on 
the  Cloud.  To  fast  track  adoption,  the  U.S.  General 
Services Administration has established a portal dedicated 
to cloud computing applications for the public sector. The

agencies with a common platform for the procurement of 
cloud services from recommended service providers [8]. 
 
In 2010, the Taiwanese Government announced its Cloud 
Computing  Industry  Development  Program  with  the  aim 
of  maintaining  its  ICT  industry‟s  competitiveness  in  the 
global  market.  The  Government  plans  to  spend  $744

computing 
the  country. 
Microsoft  inked  a  separate  agreement  with  Taiwan's 
largest phone company, Chunghwa Telecom, allowing the 
carrier to deploy the Windows Azure operating system for 
its cloud-technology applications. Microsoft also signed a

Government  information  systems  are  using  innovative 
technologies,  such  as  cloud  computing,  to  develop  the 
Kasumigaseki  Cloud  (tentative  name)  in  stages  by  2015. 
The Kasumigaseki Cloud will enable various ministries to 
collaborate  to  integrate  and  consolidate  hardware  and 
create platforms for shared functions. Efforts will be made 
to  efficiently  develop  and  operate  information  systems 
with  the  aim  to  greatly  reducing  electronic  government-
related  development  and  operating  costs  while  increasing 
the  pace  of  processing  by  integrating  shared  functions, 
increasing  collaboration  among  systems,  and  providing 
secure and advanced governmental services [10]. 
 
The  government  of  India  is  actively  promoting  Cloud 
computing  through  the  construction  of  various  test  beds 
and the launch of multiple Cloud service initiatives such as 
e-governance,  Cloud  grids  etc.  The  adoption  of  cloud 
computing services, which is expected to cross one billion 
US dollar by 2014 in India, will be driven by government 
initiatives like e-governance and the Unique Identification 
Authority of India (UIDAI) project.

Information  Technology,  Government  of  India  launched 
the  portal,  in  August  2010.  It  has  been  developed  by  a 
start-up member company of NASSCOM, and is hosted on 
the Cloud platform. The portal has built a rich directory of

Abstract:  The  introduction  and  continuous  development  of  information  and  communication  technologies  has  made 
governments  across  the  globe  realize  their  potential  benefits.  Although  the  computerization  of  departments  has 
enhanced  the  efficiency  with  which  information  is  handled  and  processed,  it  comes  at  a  large  cost  in  terms  of 
infrastructure, skilled personnel and user reluctance. Whenever there is a change or update in technology, there arises a 
major need to update the infrastructure, skill set as well as the user perspective. Its not always possible to carry out such 
hugely expensive changes every time there is a technology update. Leaving aside the under-developed ones, even the 
developed countries would not afford to risk their resources for such tasks every now and then. In this paper, we take 
up  the  issue  from  a  cloud  based  computing  perspective  and  propose  a  cloud  framework  for  the  Indian  National  e-
Governance Plan (NeGP) to ensure interoperability functionality among different states and to see the benefits such as - 
reduce the operating costs, provide greater reliability, transparency and sustainability while using latest technologies.

INTRODUCTION TO E-GOVERNANCE 

to 

“E-Government”  refers 
the  use  by  government 
agencies, of information technologies (such as Wide Area 
Networks,  the  Internet,  mobile  computing)  that  have  the 
ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and 
other arms of government. These technologies can serve a 
variety  of  different  ends:  better  delivery  of  government 
services  to  citizens,  improved  interactions  with  business 
and  industry,  citizen  empowerment  through  access  to 
information,  or  more  efficient  government  management 
[1]. The resulting benefits can be- increased transparency, 
greater  convenience,  revenue  growth,  cost  reductions, 
better efficiency and performance. 
 
Electronic  governance  is  all  about  using  the  information 
and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  to  transform  the 
traditional  government  operations  through  the  application 
of  faster, more  efficient mechanisms  which help  simplify 
the  administrative  processes  in  addition to  facilitating  the 
integration of services among different departments. 

 

Governments  have  innumerable  applications  that  can  be 
automated  to  increase  productivity  and  ease  the  decision-
making  and  policy  enforcement  processes  at  a  higher 
level. The various application areas of the government can 
be classified as follows: 
 
  Government to Government (G2G): Various functions 
of  the government  agencies  interact to  fulfill a  work, 
which  requires  a  high  degree  of  message  passing 
across  departments.  For  instance,  Administration 
Control, Employment Exchange 

  Government 

to  Business 

(G2B):  The  different 
government departments need to interact with various 
business  houses  in the  private  sector. The  conduct  of 
online 
regulatory 
processes,  therefore  helping  businesses  to  become 
more 
instance,  Tendering/e-
tenders/e-procurement,  Tax  collection  and  related 
activities 

competitive.  For 

transactions 

simplifies 

the 

 
 
Government  to  Citizen  (G2C):  A  number  of 
services  are  being  offered  by  the  government agencies  to 
the citizens that can range from a simple request resolution 
to  anything  useful  to  both  the  parties.  For  instance, 
Vehicle/Land Registration, License Issuing 
In  order  to  implement  these  functions  through  the 
traditional  mechanism,  it  is  required  by  each  of  the 
government  departments 
the 
required infrastructure as there is a more or less clear cut 
boundary between the operations of any two departments. 
The emphasis is more towards the computerization of the 
work processes at a departmental level as observed in the

INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing is a relatively new business model in the 
computing  world.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  official  definition, 
"cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction." [2]

infrastructure),  and 

tenets  of  Cloud  computing  are 

The  definition  lists  five  essential  characteristics  of  cloud 
computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity  or  expansion,  and 
measured  service.  It  also  lists  three  "service  models" 
(software,  platform  and 
four 
"deployment  models"  (private,  community,  public  and 
hybrid)  that  together  categorize  ways  to  deliver  cloud 
services. In this paper, we take up the cloud characteristics 
and services in greater detail. 
 
The  main 
instant 
availability  of  services,  pay-per-use  model,  increased 
reliability and massive scalability. Following are the main 
characteristics: 
 
  On Demand Self Service: The consumer can make use 
of  the  computing  resources  such  as  processor  time, 
storage  or  bandwidth  as  and  when  required,  without 
the  need  of  any  human  involvement  with 
the 
service/resource  provider.  The  government  related 
processes, in a traditional manner, take some time for 
the  processing  of  such  requests  and  the  delay  caused 
may lead to loss  of productivity. The cloud approach 
reduces this delay substantially. 

  Broad Network Access: The consumer can access the 
cloud  services 
through  a  variety  of  channels 
irrespective  of  the  platform,  architecture  or  the 
operating  system.  The  same  content  can  be  accessed 
via a mobile phone, workstation or a laptop. The only 
requirement  is  of  connecting  to  the  cloud  and  once 
you  are  there,  you  have  virtual  access  to  the  huge 
cloud resources at your convenience. The government 
agencies and personnel need not be always present at 
their workstations. Rather, they carry their entire work 
over  the  cloud  wherever  and  whenever  there  is  a 
requirement. 

  Resource  Pooling:  The  cloud  service  provider  pools 
the computing resources to serve multiple consumers 
at multiple locations. There is dynamic allocation and 
de-allocation  of  resources  according  to  consumer 
demand,  independent  of  the  consumer  location.  The 
government  agencies  can  free 
themselves  from 
botheration  of  having  limited  resources  such  as 
storage,  network  bandwidth,  processing  speed  etc. 
They  can  rather  focus  more  on  the  productivity  and 
efficiency  of  their  operations  assuming  they  have 
unlimited  resources  at  their  disposal,  when  operating 
over the cloud. 

  Rapid  Elasticity:  The  cloud  has 

the  ability 

to 
manipulate  its  resources  among  the  consumers  based 
on  the  user  demand.  The  scaling  capacity  is  so 
efficient  and  rapid  that  the  resources  appear  to  be 
unlimited  for  provision  of  the  user  and  can  be 
appropriated  in  any  quantity  at  any  time.  The 
government  departments  can  scale  up  the  scope  for 
any  of  their  projects  without  giving much  thought to 
the resource constraints. 

  Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  the  resource  usage  by  leveraging  a  metering 
capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction  appropriate  to 
the 
(e.g.,  storage,  processing, 

type  of  service 

bandwidth, and active user accounts) being accessed. 
Resource  usage  can  be  monitored,  controlled  and 
reported,  providing  greater 
transparency.  The 
government  agencies  can  control  and  keep  check  on 
the  amount  of  services  being  used  by  each  of  its 
employees,  thus  providing  greater  transparency  and 
preventing  misuse  of  resources.  This  can  easily  be 
accomplished as whenever a person wishes to use the 
cloud  services,  he/she  is  first  authenticated  and  then 
logged for every activity performed. 

 
Fig.  2  shows  how  the  cloud  concept  can  be  used  to 
integrate  the  functioning  among  various  government 
agencies and departments.

Following  are  the  different  services  provided  through  the 
cloud platform: 


resources 
processing,  storage,  networking  etc,  where 
the 
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software 
that  can  include  operating  systems  and  applications. 
The  consumer  does  not  have 
to  bother  about 
managing  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  but has 
control over the deployed applications. 

  E-Governance

availability  with  minimum  downtime.  Application 
designers can focus more on the features and usability 
instead of worrying about the scalability, platform and 
infrastructure  requirements  when  they  design  for  the 
cloud.  Hardware  maintenance  is  greatly  reduced  on 
part of the government, which can then divert more of 
its attention towards enhancing the quality of software 
and  thereby  providing  better  quality  services  to  the 
consumers.

programming languages,  libraries,  services  and tools. 
The  consumer  does  not  have  to  worry  about  the 
underlying  cloud  infrastructure  including  network, 
servers, operating systems  or storage, but has control 
over  the  deployed  applications  and  possibly  the

Government  departments  requiring  such  resources  can 
request  and  get  them  instantly  as  compared  to  the 
traditional  methods  where  they  have  to  wait  until  the 
resources  are  first  purchased  and  then  deployed.  The 
programmers do not have to constrain their imagination or 
adjust  their  skills  according  to  the  available  resources. 
They can also code for various platforms simultaneously. 
 
  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  Consumer  has  the 
capability  of  running  applications  over  the  cloud 
infrastructure,  which  are  accessible  through  either  a 
thin  client  interface  (such  as  a  web  browser)  or  a 
program interface. The consumer does not manage or 
control  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  including 
network,  servers,  operating  systems,  storage  or  even 
individual  application  capabilities,  with  the  possible 
exception  of 
application 
configuration settings. 
 

limited  user-specific 

Since  the  cloud  offers  applications  as  services,  numerous 
applications can be provided as standard packages, which 
the similar departments all over the world can request and 
manage.  These  services  can  be  generalized  to  cater  to  a 
wider  audience  base  distributed  across 
international 
boundaries, so that time is not wasted in creating similarly 
functioning  redundant  applications.  Instead,  one  can 
contribute towards enhancing the capability and quality of 
the  general  one  so  that  all  the  consumers  of  the  same 
service  are  benefitted  altogether.  According  to  studies  in 
the  field  of  Software  Engineering,  Software  Maintenance 
consumes  maximum  of  the  total  cost  involved  in  a 
software  product  during  the  Software  Development  Life 
Cycle (SDLC) process [3]. Hence, it is always economical 
to maintain a general copy of software and deliver it to the 
consumers  with  minor  customizations  as  desired  by  the 
latter‟s  requirements,  instead  of  going  in  for  an  entirely 
new  piece  of  software  application  right  from  the  scratch. 
In  case  of  any  bug  detection  after  the  deployment  too,  a 
single  patch  file  shall  be  able  to  take  care  of  multiple 
installations but this is not the case in standalone systems. 
A cloud  based approach can better handle such situations 
through  its  service  oriented  architecture  and  thus  reduce 
the government expenses. Fig. 3 represents how the cloud 
solutions scale up near to the rate of business as compared 
to the traditional ones based on a survey conducted for the 
Confederation 
by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC).

Going  through  the  basics,  we  can  have  the  following 
advantages using the cloud platform: 
 
  Availability: The cloud is responsible to provide 24x7 
access  of  its  service  uptime  to  the  consumers.  The 
government agencies can get benefitted in a way that 
they  do  not  have  to  maintain  the  infrastructure  and 
hence  no  delays  in  the  delivery  of  services  to  the 
users. 

  Disaster  Recovery:  The  cloud  service  providers 
generally  maintain  their  data  centers  at  multiple 
locations  that  are  geographically  distributed.  In  case 
of  any  natural  calamity,  the  data  can  be  well 
recovered  as  multiple  copies  are  being  maintained. 
The  important  documents  need  not  be  taken  care  of 
from  a  physical  storage  point  of  view  by  the 
government agencies. 

  Transparency:  As  the  cloud  provides  measurable 
services,  activities  of  the  users  can  be  well  audited 
against any type of misuse. This also helps provide a 
mechanism  against  corruption.  There  can  be  no 
unnecessary delays in the processing of documents. 

  Updation  of  Technology:  Change  is  an  inevitable 
process.  The  government  has  to  handle  many  costs 
(software, network bandwidth, personnel training etc.) 
whenever  there  is  a  change  or  update  in  technology. 
Such  costs  can  be  greatly  reduced  on  part  of  the 
government if these considerations are handled by the 
cloud provider.

the 

  Cost  Reduction:  The  government has  to  handle  costs

governance scenario. With cloud based e-governance, 
these  costs  can  reduce  substantially.  According  to  P 
Sridhar  Reddy,  CEO  and  CMD,  CtrlS  Data  centers, 
government  estimates  say  that,  if  two  or  more  states 
consume  IT-as-a-service  using  the  private  Cloud 
model, it could save the exchequer almost 50% of the 
Rs.  1,378  crore  allocated  for  the  state  data  center 
projects [4]. 

  Software Licensing: With multiple installations of the 
same software at multiple workstations in the various 
departments,  a  huge  amount  of  recurring  cost  is 
involved in the name of Software Licensing fee which 
is  renewed  after  some  period  of  time.  In  the  cloud 
concept, one does not have to purchase the license for 
every  software  that  is  to  be  used.  Just  a  usage  fee  is 
charged for the time the software is being accessed by 
the consumer.

  Reliability:  As  the  resources  are  being  pooled  from 
various 
appropriated 
according  to  the  consumer  demand,  there  is  increase 
in  the  reliability  of  resources  as  the  cloud  service 
provider  is  bound  to  provide  non-stop  services  to  its 
clients.  The  client,  on  the  contrary,  does  not  have  to 
worry about the availability or non-availability  of the 
required resources.

  Reporting  for  Policy  Planning  and Enforcement: The 
upper level management can get instant access to the 
reports from various departments simultaneously. The 
desired information is available as and when required.

It helps  the  government agencies  to  plan and  control 
the policies more efficiently. 

  Scalability:  The  ability  of  the  cloud  architecture  to 
provide  rapid  scaling  helps  the  government  agencies 
in  a  great  deal  to  magnify  the  scope  of  their  projects 
without thinking much about resource pooling. 

  Environment  Friendly:  All  the  data  gets  stored  in  a 
centralized  fashion  over  the  cloud.  The  operations  of 
multiple data centers are not desired. There is no need 
for  additional  air  conditioning  in  the  server  rooms 
hence  no  more  chloro-fluoro  carbon  emission.  Cloud 
computing  also  results  in  lesser  use  of  paper  in  the 
offices.

CURRENT INITIATIVES 

According to  a  statement  by  Praveen  Bhadada,  Manager-
Global  Consulting,  Zinnov  Management  Consulting  Pvt. 
Ltd.,  Governments  in  Brazil,  Russia,  India,  China,  South 
Africa  and  South  Korea  (BRICSS)  nations  are  extremely 
active participants in the Cloud ecosystem [6]. 
 
The  Korean  government  has  plans  to  spend  around  610 
billion won (about $521 million) through 2014 to provide 
the  foundation  for  a  Web-based  computing  industry.  
According  to  the  initiative  announced  by  the  Korea 
Communications Commission (KCC), the country's media 
and  telecommunications  regulator,  much  of  the  planned 
spending is to be devoted to establishing cloud computing 
infrastructures and developing core technologies [7]. With 
this, the government intends to increase the Korean Cloud 
market share to 10% in the global marketplace and reduce 
the cost of public ICT infrastructure by 50%. 
 
In  the  US,  the  federal  government‟s  Chief  Information 
Officer  (CIO) has  given a mandate  that  every  department 
in every state should have at least two state applications on 
the  Cloud.  To  fast  track  adoption,  the  U.S.  General 
Services Administration has established a portal dedicated 
to cloud computing applications for the public sector. The 

in 

Japanese  Ministry  of 

technology  and  services 

portal  -  www.apps.gov  -  provides  the  public  sector 
agencies with a common platform for the procurement of 
cloud services from recommended service providers [8]. 
 
In 2010, the Taiwanese Government announced its Cloud 
Computing  Industry  Development  Program  with  the  aim 
of  maintaining  its  ICT  industry‟s  competitiveness  in  the 
global  market.  The  Government  plans  to  spend  $744 
million  over  the  next  five  years  to  establish  cloud 
computing 
the  country. 
Microsoft  inked  a  separate  agreement  with  Taiwan's 
largest phone company, Chunghwa Telecom, allowing the 
carrier to deploy the Windows Azure operating system for 
its cloud-technology applications. Microsoft also signed a 
deal with the Taiwanese government to jointly establish a 
cloud-computing research center [9]. 
 
The 
Internal  Affairs  and 
Communications  (MIC)  has  compiled  and  announced  the 
outline  of  Digital  Japan  Creation  Project  (ICT  Hatoyama 
Plan). The Project Outline sets priority policies that will be 
implemented  intensively  over  the  next  three  years  based 
on  the  emergency  proposals  of  the  Panel  on  ICT  Vision. 
Government  information  systems  are  using  innovative 
technologies,  such  as  cloud  computing,  to  develop  the 
Kasumigaseki  Cloud  (tentative  name)  in  stages  by  2015. 
The Kasumigaseki Cloud will enable various ministries to 
collaborate  to  integrate  and  consolidate  hardware  and 
create platforms for shared functions. Efforts will be made 
to  efficiently  develop  and  operate  information  systems 
with  the  aim  to  greatly  reducing  electronic  government-

the  pace  of  processing  by  integrating  shared  functions, 
increasing  collaboration  among  systems,  and  providing 
secure and advanced governmental services [10]. 
 
The  government  of  India  is  actively  promoting  Cloud 
computing  through  the  construction  of  various  test  beds 
and the launch of multiple Cloud service initiatives such as 
e-governance,  Cloud  grids  etc.  The  adoption  of  cloud 
computing services, which is expected to cross one billion 
US dollar by 2014 in India, will be driven by government 
initiatives like e-governance and the Unique Identification 
Authority of India (UIDAI) project.  
 
National Association of Software and Services Companies 
(NASSCOM) envisioned and launched eGovReach Portal

closer  interaction  and  connect  between  the  Government 
and  industry.  Mr.  R.  Chandrasekhar,  the  then  Secretary-
Information  Technology,  Government  of  India  launched 
the  portal,  in  August  2010.  It  has  been  developed  by  a 
start-up member company of NASSCOM, and is hosted on 
the Cloud platform. The portal has built a rich directory of 
service  providers  in  the  eGovernance  ecosystem.  The 
portal  now  hosts  daily  updates  on 
tenders  and

In  the  present  scenario,  the  different  Indian  states  are 
responsible for maintaining their respective statewide data 
centers through State Wide Area Networks (SWAN) right 
from  the  grassroot  Panchayat  level  in  the  villages  to  the 
Block and District levels as shown in Fig. 5. Under NeGP 
SWAN  policy,  it  is  proposed  to  connect  state  Head 
Quarter  (SHQ)  with  all  the  District  Head  Quarter  (DHQ) 
and subsequently all the DHQ to be connected with Blocks 
Head Quarters (BHQ). It will then be extended to Village 
& Gram Panchayat level. The present layout of the SWAN 
does  not  provide  for  the  interoperability  functionality 
among  the  various  states  which  tends  to  pose  problems. 
For instance, 
 
  The police departments of the different states are not 
yet  inter-connected  over  the  cloud  because  of  which 
the  criminal  information  records  are  not  instantly 
available to the authorities outside their states. 

 

  The  information  of  foreign  visitors  to  our  country 
(such  as  personal  data  and  the  visa  details)  is  not 
currently  centralized,  unlike  many  of  the  European 
Union  countries. This  poses  a  potential hazard to  the 
security  arrangements  in  our  country  as  there  is  no 
efficient  way  to  keep  track  of  the  foreigners  with 
invalid permission and their activities. 

 
With recent advancements in the computing field, the once 
looking  dream  to  have  centralized  access  to  various 
services under one portal can now soon be fulfilled by the 
usage of cloud computing methodology.

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK 

The  Government  of  India  is  discussing  the  concept  of  a 
national Cloud computing platform connecting the central 
and  state  government  as  well  as  the  municipalities  on  a 
common  platform  where  decision  making  is  faster, 
procurement  cycles  are  shorter  and  visibility  on 
government functions is much higher. 
 
Now that we are well aware about the benefits of having a 
cloud  based  working  environment  over  a  traditional  one, 
based  on  our  research,  we  figure  out  a  cloud  framework 
for  its  application  to  the  Indian  National  e-Governance 
Plan as shown in Fig. 6. 

Fig 5. Current Structure of a State Wide Area Network 

 

(SWAN) 

 
  The vehicle registration records of different states are 
also  not  yet  available  under  one  centralized  portal. 
Incase of a vehicle making some traffic rule violation 
out  of  its  state  of  registration,  it  is  a  cumbersome 
process of tracking and penalizing the culprit. 

  Due  to  the  present  unavailability  of  land/property 
registration  records  over  the  cloud,  the  concerned 
people  have  to  travel  to  the  respective  locations  and 
follow  up  with  the  concerned  officers  (like  the 
Patwaris,  Tehsildars  etc.)  for  every  small  task.  This 
leads to a lot of frustration on part of the information 
seekers and sometimes even misconduct on part of the 
officers incharge. This has been a very serious issue in 
parts of the Punjab state where a large number of Non 
Resident  Indians  (NRI‟s)  have  to  bear  with  such 
conditions. 

  A large number of heavy motor vehicles plying on the 
national highways have to make halt at the entry and 
exit  check  posts  while  crossing  the  different  state

Framework 

 

 
In  our proposed  cloud  framework, the  State  Data Centers 
corresponding  to  the  various  states  can  be  integrated 
together  logically  over  the  cloud  so  that  the  concerned 
authorities  may  be  provided  instant  access  to  the  desired 
information  without  any  delays  and  barriers 
to 
communication  across  the  states.  This  will  provide  fast 
and  efficient  resolution  to  the  governance  related  matters 
without causing inconvenience to the consumer. 
 
With the use of Cloud based technology, the SWAN for all 
the states can be integrated together at a national level so 
that  the  consumers  can  get  uninterrupted  access  to  the

Abstract:  The  introduction  and  continuous  development  of  information  and  communication  technologies  has  made 
governments  across  the  globe  realize  their  potential  benefits.  Although  the  computerization  of  departments  has 
enhanced  the  efficiency  with  which  information  is  handled  and  processed,  it  comes  at  a  large  cost  in  terms  of 
infrastructure, skilled personnel and user reluctance. Whenever there is a change or update in technology, there arises a 
major need to update the infrastructure, skill set as well as the user perspective. Its not always possible to carry out such 
hugely expensive changes every time there is a technology update. Leaving aside the under-developed ones, even the 
developed countries would not afford to risk their resources for such tasks every now and then. In this paper, we take 
up  the  issue  from  a  cloud  based  computing  perspective  and  propose  a  cloud  framework  for  the  Indian  National  e-
Governance Plan (NeGP) to ensure interoperability functionality among different states and to see the benefits such as - 
reduce the operating costs, provide greater reliability, transparency and sustainability while using latest technologies.

INTRODUCTION TO E-GOVERNANCE 

to 

“E-Government”  refers 
the  use  by  government 
agencies, of information technologies (such as Wide Area 
Networks,  the  Internet,  mobile  computing)  that  have  the 
ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and 
other arms of government. These technologies can serve a 
variety  of  different  ends:  better  delivery  of  government 
services  to  citizens,  improved  interactions  with  business 
and  industry,  citizen  empowerment  through  access  to 
information,  or  more  efficient  government  management 
[1]. The resulting benefits can be- increased transparency, 
greater  convenience,  revenue  growth,  cost  reductions, 
better efficiency and performance. 
 
Electronic  governance  is  all  about  using  the  information 
and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  to  transform  the 
traditional  government  operations  through  the  application 
of  faster, more  efficient mechanisms  which help  simplify 
the  administrative  processes  in  addition to  facilitating  the 
integration of services among different departments. 

 

Governments  have  innumerable  applications  that  can  be 
automated  to  increase  productivity  and  ease  the  decision-
making  and  policy  enforcement  processes  at  a  higher 
level. The various application areas of the government can 
be classified as follows: 
 
  Government to Government (G2G): Various functions 
of  the government  agencies  interact to  fulfill a  work, 
which  requires  a  high  degree  of  message  passing 
across  departments.  For  instance,  Administration 
Control, Employment Exchange 

  Government 

to  Business 

(G2B):  The  different 
government departments need to interact with various 
business  houses  in the  private  sector. The  conduct  of 
online 
regulatory 
processes,  therefore  helping  businesses  to  become 
more

tenders/e-procurement,  Tax  collection  and  related 
activities

 
Government  to  Citizen  (G2C):  A  number  of 
services  are  being  offered  by  the  government agencies  to 
the citizens that can range from a simple request resolution 
to  anything  useful  to  both  the  parties.  For  instance, 
Vehicle/Land Registration, License Issuing 
In  order  to  implement  these  functions  through  the 
traditional  mechanism,  it  is  required  by  each  of  the 
government  departments 
the 
required infrastructure as there is a more or less clear cut 
boundary between the operations of any two departments. 
The emphasis is more towards the computerization of the 
work processes at a departmental level as observed in the

INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud computing is a relatively new business model in the 
computing  world.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  official  definition, 
"cloud  computing  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous, 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can  be  rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction." [2]

infrastructure),  and 

tenets  of  Cloud  computing  are 

The  definition  lists  five  essential  characteristics  of  cloud 
computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, 
resource  pooling,  rapid  elasticity  or  expansion,  and 
measured  service.  It  also  lists  three  "service  models" 
(software,  platform  and 
four 
"deployment  models"  (private,  community,  public  and 
hybrid)  that  together  categorize  ways  to  deliver  cloud 
services. In this paper, we take up the cloud characteristics 
and services in greater detail. 
 
The  main 
instant 
availability  of  services,  pay-per-use  model,  increased 
reliability and massive scalability. Following are the main 
characteristics: 
 
  On Demand Self Service: The consumer can make use 
of  the  computing  resources  such  as  processor  time, 
storage  or  bandwidth  as  and  when  required,  without 
the  need  of  any  human  involvement  with 
the 
service/resource  provider.  The  government  related 
processes, in a traditional manner, take some time for 
the  processing  of  such  requests  and  the  delay  caused 
may lead to loss  of productivity. The cloud approach 
reduces this delay substantially. 

  Broad Network Access: The consumer can access the 
cloud  services 
through  a  variety  of  channels 
irrespective  of  the  platform,  architecture  or  the 
operating  system.  The  same  content  can  be  accessed 
via a mobile phone, workstation or a laptop. The only 
requirement  is  of  connecting  to  the  cloud  and  once 
you  are  there,  you  have  virtual  access  to  the  huge 
cloud resources at your convenience. The government 
agencies and personnel need not be always present at 
their workstations. Rather, they carry their entire work 
over  the  cloud  wherever  and  whenever  there  is  a 
requirement. 

  Resource  Pooling:  The  cloud  service  provider  pools 
the computing resources to serve multiple consumers 
at multiple locations. There is dynamic allocation and 
de-allocation  of  resources  according  to  consumer 
demand,  independent  of  the  consumer  location.  The 
government  agencies  can  free 
themselves  from 
botheration  of  having  limited  resources  such  as 
storage,  network  bandwidth,  processing  speed  etc. 
They  can  rather  focus  more  on  the  productivity  and 
efficiency  of  their  operations  assuming  they  have 
unlimited  resources  at  their  disposal,  when  operating 
over the cloud. 

  Rapid  Elasticity:  The  cloud  has 

the  ability 

to 
manipulate  its  resources  among  the  consumers  based 
on  the  user  demand.  The  scaling  capacity  is  so 
efficient  and  rapid  that  the  resources  appear  to  be 
unlimited  for  provision  of  the  user  and  can  be 
appropriated  in  any  quantity  at  any  time.  The 
government  departments  can  scale  up  the  scope  for 
any  of  their  projects  without  giving much  thought to 
the resource constraints. 

  Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  the  resource  usage  by  leveraging  a  metering 
capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction  appropriate  to 
the 
(e.g.,  storage,  processing, 

type  of  service 

bandwidth, and active user accounts) being accessed. 
Resource  usage  can  be  monitored,  controlled  and 
reported,  providing  greater 
transparency.  The 
government  agencies  can  control  and  keep  check  on 
the  amount  of  services  being  used  by  each  of  its 
employees,  thus  providing  greater  transparency  and 
preventing  misuse  of  resources.  This  can  easily  be 
accomplished as whenever a person wishes to use the 
cloud  services,  he/she  is  first  authenticated  and  then 
logged for every activity performed. 

 
Fig.  2  shows  how  the  cloud  concept  can  be  used  to 
integrate  the  functioning  among  various  government 
agencies and departments.

consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software 
that  can  include  operating  systems  and  applications. 
The  consumer  does  not  have 
to  bother  about 
managing  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  but has 
control over the deployed applications.

availability  with  minimum  downtime.  Application 
designers can focus more on the features and usability 
instead of worrying about the scalability, platform and 
infrastructure  requirements  when  they  design  for  the 
cloud.  Hardware  maintenance  is  greatly  reduced  on 
part of the government, which can then divert more of 
its attention towards enhancing the quality of software 
and  thereby  providing  better  quality  services  to  the 
consumers.

underlying  cloud  infrastructure  including  network, 
servers, operating systems  or storage, but has control 
over  the  deployed  applications  and  possibly  the

the  application-hosting 

Government  departments  requiring  such  resources  can 
request  and  get  them  instantly  as  compared  to  the 
traditional  methods  where  they  have  to  wait  until  the 
resources  are  first  purchased  and  then  deployed.  The 
programmers do not have to constrain their imagination or 
adjust  their  skills  according  to  the  available  resources. 
They can also code for various platforms simultaneously. 
 
  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  Consumer  has  the 
capability  of  running  applications  over  the  cloud 
infrastructure,  which  are  accessible  through  either  a 
thin  client  interface  (such  as  a  web  browser)  or  a 
program interface. The consumer does not manage or 
control  the  underlying  cloud  infrastructure  including 
network,  servers,  operating  systems,  storage  or  even 
individual  application  capabilities,  with  the  possible 
exception  of 
application 
configuration settings. 
 

limited  user-specific 

Since  the  cloud  offers  applications  as  services,  numerous 
applications can be provided as standard packages, which 
the similar departments all over the world can request and 
manage.  These  services  can  be  generalized  to  cater  to  a 
wider  audience  base  distributed  across 
international 
boundaries, so that time is not wasted in creating similarly 
functioning  redundant  applications.  Instead,  one  can 
contribute towards enhancing the capability and quality of 
the  general  one  so  that  all  the  consumers  of  the  same 
service  are  benefitted  altogether.  According  to  studies  in 
the  field  of  Software  Engineering,  Software  Maintenance 
consumes  maximum  of  the  total  cost  involved  in  a 
software  product  during  the  Software  Development  Life 
Cycle (SDLC) process [3]. Hence, it is always economical 
to maintain a general copy of software and deliver it to the 
consumers  with  minor  customizations  as  desired  by  the 
latter‟s  requirements,  instead  of  going  in  for  an  entirely 
new  piece  of  software  application  right  from  the  scratch. 
In  case  of  any  bug  detection  after  the  deployment  too,  a 
single  patch  file  shall  be  able  to  take  care  of  multiple 
installations but this is not the case in standalone systems. 
A cloud  based approach can better handle such situations 
through  its  service  oriented  architecture  and  thus  reduce 
the government expenses. Fig. 3 represents how the cloud 
solutions scale up near to the rate of business as compared 
to the traditional ones based on a survey conducted for the 
Confederation 
by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC).

Going  through  the  basics,  we  can  have  the  following 
advantages using the cloud platform: 
 
  Availability: The cloud is responsible to provide 24x7 
access  of  its  service  uptime  to  the  consumers.  The 
government agencies can get benefitted in a way that 
they  do  not  have  to  maintain  the  infrastructure  and 
hence  no  delays  in  the  delivery  of  services  to  the 
users. 

  Disaster  Recovery:  The  cloud  service  providers 
generally  maintain  their  data  centers  at  multiple 
locations  that  are  geographically  distributed.  In  case 
of  any  natural  calamity,  the  data  can  be  well 
recovered  as  multiple  copies  are  being  maintained. 
The  important  documents  need  not  be  taken  care  of 
from  a  physical  storage  point  of  view  by  the 
government agencies. 

  Transparency:  As  the  cloud  provides  measurable 
services,  activities  of  the  users  can  be  well  audited 
against any type of misuse. This also helps provide a 
mechanism  against  corruption.  There  can  be  no 
unnecessary delays in the processing of documents. 

  Updation  of  Technology:  Change  is  an  inevitable 
process.  The  government  has  to  handle  many  costs 
(software, network bandwidth, personnel training etc.) 
whenever  there  is  a  change  or  update  in  technology. 
Such  costs  can  be  greatly  reduced  on  part  of  the 
government if these considerations are handled by the 
cloud provider.

the 

  Cost  Reduction:  The  government has  to  handle  costs

governance scenario. With cloud based e-governance, 
these  costs  can  reduce  substantially.  According  to  P 
Sridhar  Reddy,  CEO  and  CMD,  CtrlS  Data  centers, 
government  estimates  say  that,  if  two  or  more  states 
consume  IT-as-a-service  using  the  private  Cloud 
model, it could save the exchequer almost 50% of the 
Rs.  1,378  crore  allocated  for  the  state  data  center 
projects [4]. 

  Software Licensing: With multiple installations of the 
same software at multiple workstations in the various 
departments,  a  huge  amount  of  recurring  cost  is 
involved in the name of Software Licensing fee which 
is  renewed  after  some  period  of  time.  In  the  cloud 
concept, one does not have to purchase the license for 
every  software  that  is  to  be  used.  Just  a  usage  fee  is 
charged for the time the software is being accessed by 
the consumer.

  Reliability:  As  the  resources  are  being  pooled  from 
various 
appropriated 
according  to  the  consumer  demand,  there  is  increase 
in  the  reliability  of  resources  as  the  cloud  service 
provider  is  bound  to  provide  non-stop  services  to  its 
clients.  The  client,  on  the  contrary,  does  not  have  to 
worry about the availability or non-availability  of the 
required resources.

upper level management can get instant access to the 
reports from various departments simultaneously. The 
desired information is available as and when required.

It helps  the  government agencies  to  plan and  control 
the policies more efficiently. 

  Scalability:  The  ability  of  the  cloud  architecture  to 
provide  rapid  scaling  helps  the  government  agencies 
in  a  great  deal  to  magnify  the  scope  of  their  projects 
without thinking much about resource pooling. 

  Environment  Friendly:  All  the  data  gets  stored  in  a 
centralized  fashion  over  the  cloud.  The  operations  of 
multiple data centers are not desired. There is no need 
for  additional  air  conditioning  in  the  server  rooms 
hence  no  more  chloro-fluoro  carbon  emission.  Cloud 
computing  also  results  in  lesser  use  of  paper  in  the 
offices.

CURRENT INITIATIVES 

According to  a  statement  by  Praveen  Bhadada,  Manager-
Global  Consulting,  Zinnov  Management  Consulting  Pvt. 
Ltd.,  Governments  in  Brazil,  Russia,  India,  China,  South 
Africa  and  South  Korea  (BRICSS)  nations  are  extremely

The  Korean  government  has  plans  to  spend  around  610 
billion won (about $521 million) through 2014 to provide 
the  foundation  for  a  Web-based  computing  industry.  
According  to  the  initiative  announced  by  the  Korea 
Communications Commission (KCC), the country's media 
and  telecommunications  regulator,  much  of  the  planned 
spending is to be devoted to establishing cloud computing 
infrastructures and developing core technologies [7]. With 
this, the government intends to increase the Korean Cloud 
market share to 10% in the global marketplace and reduce 
the cost of public ICT infrastructure by 50%. 
 
In  the  US,  the  federal  government‟s  Chief  Information

In  the  present  scenario,  the  different  Indian  states  are 
responsible for maintaining their respective statewide data 
centers through State Wide Area Networks (SWAN) right 
from  the  grassroot  Panchayat  level  in  the  villages  to  the 
Block and District levels as shown in Fig. 5. Under NeGP 
SWAN  policy,  it  is  proposed  to  connect  state  Head 
Quarter  (SHQ)  with  all  the  District  Head  Quarter  (DHQ) 
and subsequently all the DHQ to be connected with Blocks 
Head Quarters (BHQ). It will then be extended to Village 
& Gram Panchayat level. The present layout of the SWAN 
does  not  provide  for  the  interoperability  functionality 
among  the  various  states  which  tends  to  pose  problems. 
For instance, 
 
  The police departments of the different states are not 
yet  inter-connected  over  the  cloud  because  of  which 
the  criminal  information  records  are  not  instantly 
available to the authorities outside their states. 

 

  The  information  of  foreign  visitors  to  our  country 
(such  as  personal  data  and  the  visa  details)  is  not 
currently  centralized,  unlike  many  of  the  European 
Union  countries. This  poses  a  potential hazard to  the 
security  arrangements  in  our  country  as  there  is  no 
efficient  way  to  keep  track  of  the  foreigners  with 
invalid permission and their activities. 

 
With recent advancements in the computing field, the once 
looking  dream  to  have  centralized  access  to  various 
services under one portal can now soon be fulfilled by the 
usage of cloud computing methodology. 
 

IV. 

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK 

The  Government  of  India  is  discussing  the  concept  of  a 
national Cloud computing platform connecting the central 
and  state  government  as  well  as  the  municipalities  on  a 
common  platform  where  decision  making  is  faster, 
procurement  cycles  are  shorter  and  visibility  on 
government functions is much higher. 
 
Now that we are well aware about the benefits of having a 
cloud  based  working  environment  over  a  traditional  one, 
based  on  our  research,  we  figure  out  a  cloud  framework 
for  its  application  to  the  Indian  National  e-Governance 
Plan as shown in Fig. 6.

(SWAN) 

 
  The vehicle registration records of different states are 
also  not  yet  available  under  one  centralized  portal. 
Incase of a vehicle making some traffic rule violation 
out  of  its  state  of  registration,  it  is  a  cumbersome 
process of tracking and penalizing the culprit. 

  Due  to  the  present  unavailability  of  land/property 
registration  records  over  the  cloud,  the  concerned 
people  have  to  travel  to  the  respective  locations  and 
follow  up  with  the  concerned  officers  (like  the 
Patwaris,  Tehsildars  etc.)  for  every  small  task.  This 
leads to a lot of frustration on part of the information 
seekers and sometimes even misconduct on part of the 
officers incharge. This has been a very serious issue in 
parts of the Punjab state where a large number of Non 
Resident  Indians  (NRI‟s)  have  to  bear  with  such 
conditions. 

  A large number of heavy motor vehicles plying on the 
national highways have to make halt at the entry and 
exit  check  posts  while  crossing  the  different  state

Framework 

 

 
In  our proposed  cloud  framework, the  State  Data Centers 
corresponding  to  the  various  states  can  be  integrated 
together  logically  over  the  cloud  so  that  the  concerned 
authorities  may  be  provided  instant  access  to  the  desired 
information  without  any  delays  and  barriers 
to 
communication  across  the  states.  This  will  provide  fast 
and  efficient  resolution  to  the  governance  related  matters 
without causing inconvenience to the consumer. 
 
With the use of Cloud based technology, the SWAN for all 
the states can be integrated together at a national level so 
that  the  consumers  can  get  uninterrupted  access  to  the

information they seek instantly. Listed below are some of 
the  potential  applications  where  cloud  computing  can 
prove beneficial: 
  Having  the  criminal  information  records  maintained 
over the cloud can help the police departments of the 
various  states  as  well  as  other  investigation  agencies 
to track the criminal activities more efficiently.  

  Controlling the movement of traffic  on the roads can 
become  easier.  Any  vehicle  breaking  some  rule  can 
easily  be tracked and penalized, even out of the state 
of  its registration  once  the registration information  is 
available  over  the  cloud  and  made  accessible  to  the 
authorities outside the vehicle registering state.  

  With the availability  of land registration records over 
the  cloud,  the  Non  Resident  Indians  (NRI‟s)  will not 
have to rush back to their villages and struggle hard to 
get  some  piece  of  paper ready.  The  cloud  computing 
will  also  help  curb  the  issue  of  corruption  through 
increasing transparency of government agencies. 

  We can also imagine having the barrier records for all 
the states centralized so that the vehicles do not have 
to make halt at every state barrier check post. Rather,  
they  can  make  a  collective  tax  payment  for  all  the  states 
being  travelled  at  their  starting  location  when  they  begin 
their  long  route  journey  in  order  to  avoid  unnecessary 
delays enroute. 
 
 
The information of all the foreign visitors can be 
maintained  over  the  cloud  so  that  there  is  an  efficient 
mechanism to  keep  track  of  their  background  checks  and 
activities in our country across all the states. 
 
The Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) state government is the first 
to  adopt  Cloud  computing  for  its  e-governance  services. 
The government, using the State Data Centers based out of 
Madhya  Pradesh,  is  provisioning  e-governance  services 
such as issuing death or birth certificates and trade licenses 
through  the  Cloud.  It  is  using  Microsoft‟s  solution  to 
implement  Cloud  computing.  The  use  of  the  cloud 
computing model enabled the J&K government to roll out 
these  services  within  60  days  at  zero  initial  cost.  The 
governments  of  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Uttaranchal  are 
also 
to  roll  out  e-
Government services based on the Cloud platform [13]. 
 
Cloud  Computing  will  definitely  prove  to  be  a  big  step 
forward  in  the  direction  of  providing  SMART  (simple, 
moral, 
transparent) 
governance to the citizens.
