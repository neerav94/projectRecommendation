Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth.

users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11].

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6].

2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6].

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID }

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a

you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11].

3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider.

3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID }

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

Operate design and operational process for rights management system, user authentication 
and service authentication using OAuth. We descript the proposed model implementation

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated.

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

Operate design and operational process for rights management system, user authentication 
and service authentication using OAuth. We descript the proposed model implementation 
results and logical evaluation in chapter four. Finally, chapter five is conclusion. 
 
2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider. 
Table 2 descript for each components. 
 
3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID } 

226

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities.

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider. 
Table 2 descript for each components. 
 
3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID } 

226

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

4. Experiment and Analysis 
 
4.1. Experimental Scenario 

In this paper, we build a book search system in order to test the proposed protocol, the 
user authentication protocol design and implementation. Environment of proposed system 
has two  Linux  operating  system  of  the  Book  Search server.  Book  Search  server  each  to 
each was designed have three Book Research  DATABASE server. We are Book Search 
in a cloud computing environment use Hadoop. 

Experimental scenarios are two. User's access to the system and authority was limited. 
Scenario 2 has all rights to the User access to the system. The order of the authority is the 
read, modify, download and optional. 

 

(1) Experimental scenario 1 

User  A  request  access  to  the  system  by  the  Book  Search  Book  named  "Antonio 
Salieri". User A read, download, and print rights have to connect to the web server. User 
A  experiments  were  possible  to  normal  data  research.  Also,  Test  the  fails  of  the 
experiment when DATABASE to modify the data access. 

Privilege_A = { 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 } Order to read, impossible to modify, download, option to 

authorize. Shown in Figure 7.Shows the modification is limited privileges.

(2) Experimental scenario 2 

User  B  to  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  shall  have  the  authority.  Experiments 
was to the normal behavior when a user B with all privileges to research data. Also, Test 
the success of the experiment when DATABASE to access and modify data. 

Privilege_B  =  {  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  }  user  B  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  was  to 

authorize.

4.3. Verification 

We want verify the reasonableness of our proposed schemes in this paper, by using the 
logic  of  ASVO  verification  one  of  the  security  protocol  verification  techniques. 
Verification goals are ASVO 0 is Activeness check the activation status. Next, ASVO 1 is 
Aliveness checks online status. And ASVO3 is verify the Authentication status [12]. 
 
(1) ASVO 0: Activeness 

It can determine whether you have received the message X for activation protocol other 

party in online status. It does not confirm the identity of others. 

 
ASVO 0 : A believes A received X…….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 1) 

230   

 

Copyright  ⓒ  2014 SERSC 

International Journal of  Security and Its Applications 
Vol.8, No.3 (2014) 
 
 
Protocol enable state is verified as a received by the X. In this paper, protocol Activity 

state is verified because Consumer received the token from Privilege Management.   
 

C  believes  SP  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. …….  ……. 
(Expression 2) 
SP  believes  U  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. 
(Expression 3) 
U believes C received token from D  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 4) 

 
(2) ASVO 1 : Aliveness 

Protocol activity state is verified other party of online status. For Implied to the identity 
of the other party to make, protocol participants should be able to get the trust on the other 
side of the transmission and point. 

 
ASVO 1 : A believes B says X    …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 5) 

This  is  authentication  to  implied  because  perform  protocol  between  A  and  B.  In  this 
paper,  Consumer  can  verify  to  activity  protocol  as  the  Service  Provider  exchange  the 
Token in online status. 
 

C believes SP say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 6) 
SP believes U say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 7) 
U believes C say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …  …….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 8) 

 
(3) ASVO 2 : Authentication 

We cannot be sure whether a trust for the communication between themselves and that 
is the other party. Therefore, Shall determine whether the certification of the other party 
through the key distribution. 
 

ASVO 2 : A believes B says A key B and A believes A keyB.  …  …….  ……. …. …. ……. …. 
(Expression 9) 

 

It trust the fact that A and B share the same key, and it shows that B also recognized 
the fact. In this paper, Consumer believes Service Provider because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. And Consumer believes you because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. 
 

C  believes  SP  say  C    token  SP    and    C  believes  C  say  C token  SP  ….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 10) 
SP  believes  U  say  SP  token  U    and    SP  believes  SP  say  SP  token  U    …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 11) 
U believes C say U    token C and    U    believes U say U token C    …….  …  …  …….  …. 
(Expression 12) 

 

ASVO verification method validation results, we were able to prove that this protocol 

is logically.

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider. 
Table 2 descript for each components. 
 
3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID } 

226

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

4. Experiment and Analysis 
 
4.1. Experimental Scenario 

In this paper, we build a book search system in order to test the proposed protocol, the 
user authentication protocol design and implementation. Environment of proposed system 
has two  Linux  operating  system  of  the  Book  Search server.  Book  Search  server  each  to 
each was designed have three Book Research  DATABASE server. We are Book Search 
in a cloud computing environment use Hadoop. 

Experimental scenarios are two. User's access to the system and authority was limited. 
Scenario 2 has all rights to the User access to the system. The order of the authority is the 
read, modify, download and optional. 

 

(1) Experimental scenario 1 

User  A  request  access  to  the  system  by  the  Book  Search  Book  named  "Antonio 
Salieri". User A read, download, and print rights have to connect to the web server. User 
A  experiments  were  possible  to  normal  data  research.  Also,  Test  the  fails  of  the 
experiment when DATABASE to modify the data access. 

Privilege_A = { 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 } Order to read, impossible to modify, download, option to 

authorize. Shown in Figure 7.Shows the modification is limited privileges. 
 

Figure 7. System Configuration of Scenario 1 

 

(2) Experimental scenario 2 

User  B  to  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  shall  have  the  authority.  Experiments 
was to the normal behavior when a user B with all privileges to research data. Also, Test 
the success of the experiment when DATABASE to access and modify data. 

Privilege_B  =  {  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  }  user  B  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  was  to 

authorize.

4.2. The Experimental Results 

(1) Experimental results of Scenario 1 

This scenario, ADAMS was implemented of the user's initial identification process to 
connect to the web server to handle the authentication. In Fig.9, Logged in enter your user 
ID  and  password  then  user  ID,  password,  timestamp  and  nonce  value  is  checking  the 
screen.

Scenario  2  is  the  same  as  for  Scenario1  except  DATABASE  to  modify  the  approach 
that it is possible. It shows that cannot to access if you do not have permission. It shows 
that  success  in  DATABASE  modification  of  Scenario  2  because  you  have  to  the 
permissions.

4.3. Verification 

We want verify the reasonableness of our proposed schemes in this paper, by using the 
logic  of  ASVO  verification  one  of  the  security  protocol  verification  techniques. 
Verification goals are ASVO 0 is Activeness check the activation status. Next, ASVO 1 is 
Aliveness checks online status. And ASVO3 is verify the Authentication status [12]. 
 
(1) ASVO 0: Activeness 

It can determine whether you have received the message X for activation protocol other 

party in online status. It does not confirm the identity of others. 

 
ASVO 0 : A believes A received X…….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 1) 

230   

 

Copyright  ⓒ  2014 SERSC 

International Journal of  Security and Its Applications 
Vol.8, No.3 (2014) 
 
 
Protocol enable state is verified as a received by the X. In this paper, protocol Activity 

state is verified because Consumer received the token from Privilege Management.   
 

C  believes  SP  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. …….  ……. 
(Expression 2) 
SP  believes  U  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. 
(Expression 3) 
U believes C received token from D  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 4) 

 
(2) ASVO 1 : Aliveness 

Protocol activity state is verified other party of online status. For Implied to the identity 
of the other party to make, protocol participants should be able to get the trust on the other 
side of the transmission and point. 

 
ASVO 1 : A believes B says X    …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 5) 

This  is  authentication  to  implied  because  perform  protocol  between  A  and  B.  In  this 
paper,  Consumer  can  verify  to  activity  protocol  as  the  Service  Provider  exchange  the 
Token in online status. 
 

C believes SP say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 6) 
SP believes U say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 7) 
U believes C say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …  …….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 8) 

 
(3) ASVO 2 : Authentication 

We cannot be sure whether a trust for the communication between themselves and that 
is the other party. Therefore, Shall determine whether the certification of the other party 
through the key distribution. 
 

ASVO 2 : A believes B says A key B and A believes A keyB.  …  …….  ……. …. …. ……. …. 
(Expression 9) 

 

It trust the fact that A and B share the same key, and it shows that B also recognized 
the fact. In this paper, Consumer believes Service Provider because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. And Consumer believes you because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. 
 

C  believes  SP  say  C    token  SP    and    C  believes  C  say  C token  SP  ….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 10) 
SP  believes  U  say  SP  token  U    and    SP  believes  SP  say  SP  token  U    …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 11) 
U believes C say U    token C and    U    believes U say U token C    …….  …  …  …….  …. 
(Expression 12) 

 

ASVO verification method validation results, we were able to prove that this protocol 

is logically.

5. Conclusion 

Cloud  computing  environment  is  growing  rapidly  in  demand  because  due  to  ease  of 
access  and  increase  resource  utilization.  But  it  has  many  security  vulnerabilities  Due  to 
the  specificity  of  virtualization  technology  to  provide  of  cloud  computing  environment. 
Recently,  has  been  developed  a  fast  and  simple  protocol  OAuth  to  authentication 
structure. But yet the problem of security and privacy is implied. 

This paper proposed and designed ADAMS for user authentication systems to be used 
in cloud environments and mobile cloud environment. ADAMS is a hybrid authentication 
protocol.  User  identity  authentication  was  used  symmetric-key  approach  and  service 
authentication  was  used  public-key  approach.  In  the  Services  Certification  was  adding 
that privilege management method by change the existing OAuth protocol authentication. 
As  shown  in  the  operating  procedures  provide  basic  security  services  such  as 
confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. ADAMS structure has higher security than 
OAuth  protocol.  It  has  simple  processing  procedures  compared  with  existing 
authentication system. 

ADAMS  is  integrated  authentication  protocol  system  to  one  integrated  system 
configured  into  user  identity  authentication  and  privilege  management  services.  We 
expected  good  retrieval  system  by  integrating  several  agencies,  including  the  ability  to 
perform cross-certification system utilizing advanced research in progress.

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities.

Operate design and operational process for rights management system, user authentication 
and service authentication using OAuth. We descript the proposed model implementation 
results and logical evaluation in chapter four. Finally, chapter five is conclusion. 
 
2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider. 
Table 2 descript for each components. 
 
3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID } 

226

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

4. Experiment and Analysis 
 
4.1. Experimental Scenario 

In this paper, we build a book search system in order to test the proposed protocol, the 
user authentication protocol design and implementation. Environment of proposed system 
has two  Linux  operating  system  of  the  Book  Search server.  Book  Search  server  each  to 
each was designed have three Book Research  DATABASE server. We are Book Search 
in a cloud computing environment use Hadoop. 

Experimental scenarios are two. User's access to the system and authority was limited. 
Scenario 2 has all rights to the User access to the system. The order of the authority is the 
read, modify, download and optional. 

 

(1) Experimental scenario 1 

User  A  request  access  to  the  system  by  the  Book  Search  Book  named  "Antonio 
Salieri". User A read, download, and print rights have to connect to the web server. User 
A  experiments  were  possible  to  normal  data  research.  Also,  Test  the  fails  of  the 
experiment when DATABASE to modify the data access. 

Privilege_A = { 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 } Order to read, impossible to modify, download, option to 

authorize. Shown in Figure 7.Shows the modification is limited privileges. 
 

Figure 7. System Configuration of Scenario 1 

 

(2) Experimental scenario 2 

User  B  to  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  shall  have  the  authority.  Experiments 
was to the normal behavior when a user B with all privileges to research data. Also, Test 
the success of the experiment when DATABASE to access and modify data. 

Privilege_B  =  {  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  }  user  B  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  was  to 

authorize.

4.2. The Experimental Results 

(1) Experimental results of Scenario 1 

This scenario, ADAMS was implemented of the user's initial identification process to 
connect to the web server to handle the authentication. In Fig.9, Logged in enter your user 
ID  and  password  then  user  ID,  password,  timestamp  and  nonce  value  is  checking  the 
screen.

(2) Experimental results of Scenario 2 

Scenario  2  is  the  same  as  for  Scenario1  except  DATABASE  to  modify  the  approach 
that it is possible. It shows that cannot to access if you do not have permission. It shows 
that  success  in  DATABASE  modification  of  Scenario  2  because  you  have  to  the 
permissions.

4.3. Verification 

We want verify the reasonableness of our proposed schemes in this paper, by using the 
logic  of  ASVO  verification  one  of  the  security  protocol  verification  techniques. 
Verification goals are ASVO 0 is Activeness check the activation status. Next, ASVO 1 is 
Aliveness checks online status. And ASVO3 is verify the Authentication status [12]. 
 
(1) ASVO 0: Activeness 

It can determine whether you have received the message X for activation protocol other 

party in online status. It does not confirm the identity of others. 

 
ASVO 0 : A believes A received X…….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 1) 

230   

 

Copyright  ⓒ  2014 SERSC 

International Journal of  Security and Its Applications 
Vol.8, No.3 (2014) 
 
 
Protocol enable state is verified as a received by the X. In this paper, protocol Activity 

state is verified because Consumer received the token from Privilege Management.   
 

C  believes  SP  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. …….  ……. 
(Expression 2) 
SP  believes  U  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. 
(Expression 3) 
U believes C received token from D  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 4) 

 
(2) ASVO 1 : Aliveness 

Protocol activity state is verified other party of online status. For Implied to the identity 
of the other party to make, protocol participants should be able to get the trust on the other 
side of the transmission and point. 

 
ASVO 1 : A believes B says X    …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 5) 

This  is  authentication  to  implied  because  perform  protocol  between  A  and  B.  In  this 
paper,  Consumer  can  verify  to  activity  protocol  as  the  Service  Provider  exchange  the 
Token in online status. 
 

C believes SP say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 6) 
SP believes U say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 7) 
U believes C say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …  …….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 8) 

 
(3) ASVO 2 : Authentication 

We cannot be sure whether a trust for the communication between themselves and that 
is the other party. Therefore, Shall determine whether the certification of the other party 
through the key distribution. 
 

ASVO 2 : A believes B says A key B and A believes A keyB.  …  …….  ……. …. …. ……. …. 
(Expression 9) 

 

It trust the fact that A and B share the same key, and it shows that B also recognized 
the fact. In this paper, Consumer believes Service Provider because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. And Consumer believes you because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. 
 

C  believes  SP  say  C    token  SP    and    C  believes  C  say  C token  SP  ….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 10) 
SP  believes  U  say  SP  token  U    and    SP  believes  SP  say  SP  token  U    …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 11) 
U believes C say U    token C and    U    believes U say U token C    …….  …  …  …….  …. 
(Expression 12) 

 

ASVO verification method validation results, we were able to prove that this protocol 

is logically.

5. Conclusion 

Cloud  computing  environment  is  growing  rapidly  in  demand  because  due  to  ease  of 
access  and  increase  resource  utilization.  But  it  has  many  security  vulnerabilities  Due  to 
the  specificity  of  virtualization  technology  to  provide  of  cloud  computing  environment. 
Recently,  has  been  developed  a  fast  and  simple  protocol  OAuth  to  authentication 
structure. But yet the problem of security and privacy is implied. 

This paper proposed and designed ADAMS for user authentication systems to be used 
in cloud environments and mobile cloud environment. ADAMS is a hybrid authentication 
protocol.  User  identity  authentication  was  used  symmetric-key  approach  and  service 
authentication  was  used  public-key  approach.  In  the  Services  Certification  was  adding 
that privilege management method by change the existing OAuth protocol authentication. 
As  shown  in  the  operating  procedures  provide  basic  security  services  such  as 
confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. ADAMS structure has higher security than 
OAuth  protocol.  It  has  simple  processing  procedures  compared  with  existing 
authentication system. 

ADAMS  is  integrated  authentication  protocol  system  to  one  integrated  system 
configured  into  user  identity  authentication  and  privilege  management  services.  We 
expected  good  retrieval  system  by  integrating  several  agencies,  including  the  ability  to 
perform cross-certification system utilizing advanced research in progress.

Abstract 

OAuth  protocol  has  been  developed  of  fast  and  easy-to-use  proxy  authentication 
structure over a surge in user demand for mobile cloud. However, OAuth involves some 
security  and  privacy  problems.  So,  we  propose  ADAMS  for  user  user  authentication 
system mobile environments  that can support user authentication, service authentication 
and  access  control  services  more  convenience  and  easily.  ADAMS  simplify  the 
authentication processing procedures to improve the structure of complex authentication 
of SSL or PKI. We developed a book research system in order to evaluate the safety of the 
ADAMS environment. It was assessment of ADAMS logicality using ASVO logic. ADAMS 
experimental  results  can  improve  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability,  and  non-
repudiation services in mobile book research service.

1. Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  very  fast  increase  that  being  used  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  the  efficient  use  of  IT  resources.  The  world's  major  companies  provide 
cloud  computing  services.  -Google  App  Engine,  Amazon's  EC2,  Microsoft  Azure 
Services Platform etc. And KT, SK, LG, and SKT are public and typical agencies to cloud 
computing  service  in  domestic  environment.  2013  World  Mobile  SNS  number  of 
subscribers is expected to reach 10 billion. Services such as Facebook, twitter, YouTube 
and each college Book Search App service for smartphones is on the rise. Most of these 
SNS  services  are  using  OAuth.  OAuth  as  a  way  of  authenticating  users  to  access  Web 
services are vulnerable to security. Virtualization technology can violated Infringement of 
malicious code and availability [1]. Therefore, it requires the use of a safer protocol and 
more  reliable  user  authentication  to  access  cloud  computing  services.  We  propose 
ADAMS for prevent the disorder that cloud computing can occur in the vulnerability of 
virtualization  and  information  leakage  occurs  due  to  the  centralization  of  information 
service.  ADAMS  was  simplifying  the  certification  authentication  procedure  to  the 
structure  of  the  complexity  of  the  existing  PKI  and  SSL.  We  build  the  appropriate 
database  in  the  cloud  environment,  using  the  data  of  several  university  libraries  to 
experiment with ADAMS and at other universities to search. Changes to OAuth for safe 
user authentication and service authentication and permission-based access control can be 
designed  to  Book  Search.  So,  it  was  designed  so  that  it  can  effectively  handle  the 
authentication problem that can occur when sharing data from various universities. 

Composition of this treatise is as following. Chapter two, described about connection 
research  about  cloud  computing  and  certification.  And  chapter  three,  Described  about

Operate design and operational process for rights management system, user authentication 
and service authentication using OAuth. We descript the proposed model implementation 
results and logical evaluation in chapter four. Finally, chapter five is conclusion. 
 
2. Related Works 

We  explain  about  related  research  in  this  chapter.  First,  Describe  authentication 
technology  using  OAuth.  In  second  section,  we  explain  PMI  and  Cloud  computing  in 
third section. 
 
2.1. OAuth (Open Authentication) 

OAuth  1.0  protocol  developed  by  the  OpenAPI  is  an  international  standard 
authentication method. When authorized in a variety of applications, user authentication is 
used.  OAuth  is  standardized  authentication  method  each  authentication  method  as  a 
Google's  AuthSub,  AOL  OpenAuth,  Yahoo's  BBAuth,  Amazon's  Web  Services  API.  If 
you  are  using  OAuth,  this  authentication  application  to  share  ours  does  not  require  a 
separate  certification.  OAuth  can  be  authentication  and  authorization  functions  [2,  3]. 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft Messenger etc is using OAuth protocol. 

OAuth  consist  three  objects.  There  are  User,  Consumer,  and  Service  Provider.  User 
means a personal account to use the Service Provider and Consumer. Consumer is means 
the  OAuth  Service  Provider  to  access  the  web  site  or  application.  Service  Provider  is 
means Web applications to support access via OAuth. 
 

Figure 1. Procedure of OAuth Certification 

 

Figure  1  User  is  subscribed  to  the  Service  Provider.  When  consumer  is  access  to  the 
users protect data, describe authorization procedure. Step 1 shows that user should be able 
to request the data. Step 2 and 3 shows that consumer is request to the service provider a 
temporary token. And Service Provider issue token and transit to Consumer. Step 4 shows 
that  Consumer  request  access  token  for  access  to  user's  data.  In  step  5  and  6,  Service 
Provider asks whether to approve access to the User. And User approved it. Step 7 shows 
that Service Provider is passing to the Consumer Access Token. Step 8 and 9 show that 
Consumer is request to the Service Provider to access the data requested by the User and 
Service Provider to transmit data. Finally, step 10 shows Consumer response to the User 
[4].

2.2. PMI (Privilege Management Infrastructure) 

PMI  attribute  is  authentication  that  provides  information  to  users  using  the  extension 
field  of  the  X.509  certificate.  PMI  is  simple  because  existing  Public  Key  Infrastructure 
(PKI) can be used because the authentication procedure. However, the shorter the period 
for which the certificate is valid, there is a problem that different attribute certificates and 
Certificate Authority issuing authority. 

PMI  validate the attribute certificate to check the attribute information of the user. In 
this process, the privilege verifier to determine whether the user has a legitimate right that 
Connect a public-key certificates, attribute certificates and pointing it [5, 6]. 
 

Figure 2. PMI Structure 

 

Privilege Management Infrastructure of the overall structure shown in Fig. 1. OA and 
the CA of the PKI is similar to the self-authorization, SOA should blindly trust. AA rights 
of  all  or  any  certificate  issued  under  delegated  some  tasks  to  perform  from  the  SOA. 
Privilege  Holder  End-entity  who  received  assurance  from  AA  through  a  certificate 
authority  for  ownership.  Privilege  Verifier  used  to  fit  the  application  to  receive  this 
attribute certificate. Privilege Holder verify rightfully owns. 
 
2.3. Cloud Computing 

The cloud  computing  service  is  a  novel service  that  can  provide to  a  novel  computer 
function  by  network  infrastructure.  Cloud  computing  service  can  divide  by  three 
categories. It is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Below Table 1 divides cloud computing model by 
three and described explanation about it [7].

Cloud  computing  services  can  divided  depending  on  purpose  to  use  Private  Cloud, 
Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud provides flexible and affordable services in 
order to provide a variety of solutions to the services offered to the general user. Google 
AppEngine  or  Amazon's  EC2  services  are  included  here.  Private  Cloud  within  an 
enterprise  cloud  service  closed,  and  the  agency  or  organization  responsible  for  the 
management and control for the user, and security is a powerful. Hybrid Cloud is a cloud 
service  that  maximizes  the  benefits  of  Public  Cloud  and  Private  Cloud.  Hybrid  cloud  is 
enhanced  security  model  proposed  as  a  new  model.  It  provides  that  reliable  of  Public 
Cloud service and confidential data management services of private cloud [10]. 

Cloud  computing  is  Virtualized  resources.  From  virtualization  to  cloud  computing 
security issues that need to be addressed, is the  biggest problem. Integrated into a single 
resource  to  manage  multiple servers  exist  on  the  Host  OS is installed  on  top  of it,  there 
will  be  an  application.  Cloud  environment,  the  charging  information,  resource  sharing, 
due to the diversity of the terminal, there are a variety of risks [11]. 
 

Figure 3. Virtualization of Vulnerability 

 

Figure  3  Guest  OS  is  infected  with  secondary  infection  takes  place.  And  hypervisor 
infection  leads  to  all  the  virtual  machines  that  can  be  infected  after  shows.  In  addition, 
cloud computing due to the trustee. it is impossible to verify the user's information even if 
copy/move/modify.  By  the  service  provider  of  insider  information  leakage  possibilities 
also exist. 
 
3. Proposal System 
 
3.1. Structure of Proposal System 

ADAMS proposes to form a separate independent delegation of authority by changing 
the  OAuth  protocol.  Independent  privilege  management  provide  in  the  form  of  Web-
proxy server existing structure of PKI and CA permission from government agencies or 
provide one of both consumer or service provider of the system administrator role. This 
can  cause  high  cost.  However,  reliability  can  be  achieved.  In  addition,  the  privilege 
management system of the proposed system is simple processing procedures compared to 
OAuth. Figure 4 Shows structure of proposal system.

ADAMS consists of the user, consumer, service provider, privilege management. User, 
consumer  and  the  service  provider  should  handle  authentication  for  user  authentication 
and  interaction  devices  for  the  service  requested.  it  has  six  modules, in  order  to  convey 
information  about  the  service  it  requested.  Unlike  the  existing  OAuth,  privilege 
management has five modules to centrally control the consumer and the service provider. 
Table 2 descript for each components. 
 
3.2. Procedure of Proposal System 

Proposal  system  has  13  details  procedures.  It  can  divide  two  big  processes.  First 
processing is verifying the user identity authentication.  It consists of two steps. Figure 6 
shows proposal system. 
 

Figure 6. Procedures of our Proposal System 

 

First process has two procedures. 

1) Consumer transmits to the Service Provider User login information. In this time, the 
consumer  transmits  information  of  encrypted  by  user  ID,  PWD,  TS  and  nonce  using 
Session Key for legitimate visitor check. 

    User_Info = ENCSK{ ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

2) Service Provider permits the User into login after confirming information. 

 

The second process is authentication procedures to the Service Provider and Consumer 
objects for identification.  In  this  step,  privilege  management  creates  identification  token 
to the Consumer and Service Provider after confirming information.   

This work consists of five steps. From step 3 to 7 is describe detail procedure.   

3) Consumer and Service to Privilege Management request authentication. In this time, 
Consumer or Service Provider generate encrypted by IP, MAC, TS and Session ID. and 
pass. 

Obj_Info = ENCSK{ C_IP  | Obj_MAC | TS  | Se_ID } / Obj_Info = ENCSK{ SP_IP  | 

Obj_MAC | TS | Se_ID } 

226

4) Privilege Management verifies justice and generates a token. 

5) Privilege Management is generated token then Encrypt and passed 

Obj_Token=ENCSK{ C_IP | SP_IP | TS | Se_ID | D_MAC } 

6)  Consumer  signed  Obj_Token  by  HMAC_SHA1  algorithm  and  his  own  secret  key 

value. And Passed it to the other party's public key to encrypt. 

Sig_Token=ENSK(HMAC-SHA1{Obj_Token, s_key}) 

7) Completing the process of identity authentication by opponent. 

 

Next procedure has four steps. Service request and the Privilege Management through 
a  process  of  mutual  authentication  is  to  go  through  the  certification  process  for  the 
service. It is from 8 to 11 steps. 

8) User request access to the Service Provider for the resource. 

Request_Service= ENSK{Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

9) Service Provider requests privilege information of user for prove the legitimacy of 

user request. The authorization information is encrypted using the session key. 

User_Request=ENSK { Service_ID | Obj_name | ID | PWD | TS | nonce} 

10) Privilege Management to validate the user's rights.. 

11)  Privilege  management  transfer  user's  privilege  information  by  encryption.  At  this 

time, guide to license is according to the User's privilege. 

User_Privilege = ENSK{ Service_ID | Obj_name | R | W | E | Optional } 

12)  Service  Provider  transfers  the  results  of  limiting  by  privilege  management  to  the 
user's  request.  At  this  time,  you  can  avoid  the  man-in-the-middle  attacks  by  the  other 
party's public key encryption. 

Response_Service(Resource=ENSK (Service_ID | Obj_result) 

13) Finally, disconnect a session that means communication is terminated. 
 
We  can  be  seen  that  the  course  of  action  to  provide  basic  security  services  of 
confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  such  as  man-in-the-middle  attack.  Table  3  is

4. Experiment and Analysis 
 
4.1. Experimental Scenario 

In this paper, we build a book search system in order to test the proposed protocol, the 
user authentication protocol design and implementation. Environment of proposed system 
has two  Linux  operating  system  of  the  Book  Search server.  Book  Search  server  each  to 
each was designed have three Book Research  DATABASE server. We are Book Search 
in a cloud computing environment use Hadoop. 

Experimental scenarios are two. User's access to the system and authority was limited. 
Scenario 2 has all rights to the User access to the system. The order of the authority is the 
read, modify, download and optional. 

 

(1) Experimental scenario 1 

User  A  request  access  to  the  system  by  the  Book  Search  Book  named  "Antonio 
Salieri". User A read, download, and print rights have to connect to the web server. User 
A  experiments  were  possible  to  normal  data  research.  Also,  Test  the  fails  of  the 
experiment when DATABASE to modify the data access. 

Privilege_A = { 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 } Order to read, impossible to modify, download, option to 

authorize. Shown in Figure 7.Shows the modification is limited privileges. 
 

Figure 7. System Configuration of Scenario 1 

 

(2) Experimental scenario 2 

User  B  to  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  shall  have  the  authority.  Experiments 
was to the normal behavior when a user B with all privileges to research data. Also, Test 
the success of the experiment when DATABASE to access and modify data. 

Privilege_B  =  {  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  }  user  B  read,  modify,  download,  the  option  was  to 

authorize.

4.2. The Experimental Results 

(1) Experimental results of Scenario 1 

This scenario, ADAMS was implemented of the user's initial identification process to 
connect to the web server to handle the authentication. In Fig.9, Logged in enter your user 
ID  and  password  then  user  ID,  password,  timestamp  and  nonce  value  is  checking  the 
screen.

Scenario  2  is  the  same  as  for  Scenario1  except  DATABASE  to  modify  the  approach 
that it is possible. It shows that cannot to access if you do not have permission. It shows 
that  success  in  DATABASE  modification  of  Scenario  2  because  you  have  to  the 
permissions. 
 

Figure 12. Result of Access Success 

 

4.3. Verification 

We want verify the reasonableness of our proposed schemes in this paper, by using the 
logic  of  ASVO  verification  one  of  the  security  protocol  verification  techniques. 
Verification goals are ASVO 0 is Activeness check the activation status. Next, ASVO 1 is 
Aliveness checks online status. And ASVO3 is verify the Authentication status [12]. 
 
(1) ASVO 0: Activeness 

It can determine whether you have received the message X for activation protocol other 

party in online status. It does not confirm the identity of others. 

 
ASVO 0 : A believes A received X…….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 1) 

230   

 

Copyright  ⓒ  2014 SERSC 

International Journal of  Security and Its Applications 
Vol.8, No.3 (2014) 
 
 
Protocol enable state is verified as a received by the X. In this paper, protocol Activity 

state is verified because Consumer received the token from Privilege Management.   
 

C  believes  SP  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. …….  ……. 
(Expression 2) 
SP  believes  U  received  token  from  D……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. ……. 
(Expression 3) 
U believes C received token from D  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 4) 

 
(2) ASVO 1 : Aliveness 

Protocol activity state is verified other party of online status. For Implied to the identity 
of the other party to make, protocol participants should be able to get the trust on the other 
side of the transmission and point. 

 
ASVO 1 : A believes B says X    …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 5) 

This  is  authentication  to  implied  because  perform  protocol  between  A  and  B.  In  this 
paper,  Consumer  can  verify  to  activity  protocol  as  the  Service  Provider  exchange  the 
Token in online status. 
 

C believes SP say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 6) 
SP believes U say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  ……. 
(Expression 7) 
U believes C say token  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….  …….….  …….  …….  …  …….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 8) 

 
(3) ASVO 2 : Authentication 

We cannot be sure whether a trust for the communication between themselves and that 
is the other party. Therefore, Shall determine whether the certification of the other party 
through the key distribution. 
 

ASVO 2 : A believes B says A key B and A believes A keyB.  …  …….  ……. …. …. ……. …. 
(Expression 9) 

 

It trust the fact that A and B share the same key, and it shows that B also recognized 
the fact. In this paper, Consumer believes Service Provider because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. And Consumer believes you because consumer and service 
provider share the same key. 
 

C  believes  SP  say  C    token  SP    and    C  believes  C  say  C token  SP  ….  …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 10) 
SP  believes  U  say  SP  token  U    and    SP  believes  SP  say  SP  token  U    …….  …….  …. 
(Expression 11) 
U believes C say U    token C and    U    believes U say U token C    …….  …  …  …….  …. 
(Expression 12) 

 

ASVO verification method validation results, we were able to prove that this protocol 

is logically.

5. Conclusion 

Cloud  computing  environment  is  growing  rapidly  in  demand  because  due  to  ease  of 
access  and  increase  resource  utilization.  But  it  has  many  security  vulnerabilities  Due  to 
the  specificity  of  virtualization  technology  to  provide  of  cloud  computing  environment. 
Recently,  has  been  developed  a  fast  and  simple  protocol  OAuth  to  authentication 
structure. But yet the problem of security and privacy is implied. 

This paper proposed and designed ADAMS for user authentication systems to be used 
in cloud environments and mobile cloud environment. ADAMS is a hybrid authentication 
protocol.  User  identity  authentication  was  used  symmetric-key  approach  and  service 
authentication  was  used  public-key  approach.  In  the  Services  Certification  was  adding 
that privilege management method by change the existing OAuth protocol authentication. 
As  shown  in  the  operating  procedures  provide  basic  security  services  such  as 
confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. ADAMS structure has higher security than 
OAuth  protocol.  It  has  simple  processing  procedures  compared  with  existing 
authentication system. 

ADAMS  is  integrated  authentication  protocol  system  to  one  integrated  system 
configured  into  user  identity  authentication  and  privilege  management  services.  We 
expected  good  retrieval  system  by  integrating  several  agencies,  including  the  ability  to 
perform cross-certification system utilizing advanced research in progress.
