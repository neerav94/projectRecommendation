Cloud  computing  is  generally  known  as  on  demand  service.  Cloud  computing  is  an  Internet  based  service 
which provides a new technique to use huge amount of shared resources. It is a flexible and potent service spreading 
its wings on IT industry at a very fast pace. It enables services to be consumed easily as and when needed. This 
archetype has developed substantial interest in the corporate sector and the academic world, and is changing the way 
to do business. The services of cloud computing are provided across the entire computing spectrum. Organizations 
with big infrastructures are moving and extending their business towards cloud computing to lower their cost and to 
free  their  best  technology  managers  to  focus  on  creating  strategic  differentiation.  In  this  cloud,  the  ultimate 
consumers who use the services of cloud do not need anything to connect or equip themselves and their hardware 
with anything and they can have access to their data just through the Internet connectivity. There is a cloud service 
provider  who  facilitates  services  and  manages  those  services  in  the  cloud.  The  cloud  provider  facilitates  all the 
services over the Internet and as a return the end users use services according to their business needs and pay the 
service provider accordingly.  The concept of cloud includes a number of implementations, based on the services 
they provide. For instance, Google Apps Engine, Microsoft Azure, Eucalyptus, Amazon, Rackspace and Open Stack 
are  some  popular  implementations  of  cloud  computing  by  the  world  renowned  companies.  In  addition,  ACME 
Enterprise implemented VMware based v Cloud for permitting multiple organizations to share computing resources. 
Applied Materials developed a desktop cloud for CAD to get rid of the expense of changing out desktop PCs too 
often. “Apps.gov” is a website that provides cloud-based computing services to U.S. government agencies. 

Cloud  computing  is  the  next  generation  paradigm  in  computation,  which  is  continuously  growing  and

Public cloud is the property  of service provider and is used publically, private cloud refers to a property  of any 
company, and hybrid cloud is the blends of public and private cloud. Most of the cloud services are being provided 
by large cloud service companies such as Google, Amazon, and IBM. 

There  can  be  three  main  types  of  cloud  computing  services  which  the  provider  facilitates  with.  These  are 
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In SaaS, also 
known as software on demand, the software and its related data is spread on the cloud by the service provider and 
the user can access and use it through any web browser he/she works  with. In platform as a service, the service 
provider facilitates the user with set of software. PaaS is also known as solution stack as a platform. In infrastructure 
as a service the cloud service provider facilitates the users with virtual machines, servers and storage to enhance 
their business capabilities. Like types of cloud services there are cloud types also which are private, public and a 
hybrid cloud. A private cloud is a cloud in which only the authorized users can use and access the services provided 
by the provider. In pubic cloud anybody can use the cloud services whereas the hybrid cloud contains the concept of 
both public and private clouds. Though cloud computing can save an organization’s time and money but trusting the 
system is very much important because the real asset of any organization is the data which they share in the cloud to 
use the needed services either by putting it directly in the relational database, or eventually in a relational database 
through an application. Cloud computing brings a number of attributes that require special attention when it comes 
to trusting the system. The trust of the entire system depends on the data protection and prevention techniques used 
in it. Numerous different tools and techniques have been tested and introducedby the researchers for data protection 
and prevention to gain and remove the hurdle of trust but there are still gaps which needs attention and are required 
to be lined up by making these techniques much better and effective. 

Data retrieval and data security protection is the major issue in cloud computing. The security of database is 
very important for both local machine and cloud-based environment. There are certain drawbacks linked to cloud 
computing. The major issues include security, resource management and resource monitoring. Additionally, there 
are no standard rules and regulations to deploy the cloud, and there is a lack of standardization in the cloud. From 
the security point of view, a number of novel techniques had been designed and implemented in cloud, but due to 
dynamicity  of  cloud  environment  these  techniques  fall  short  of  ensuring  total  security.  Though  cloud  cannot  be 
made 100% secure, but security risks can be minimized to certain extent so that users can freely adopt it. This paper 
is based on reviewing and analyzing different available tools and techniques for data protection and prevention in 
the environment of cloud computing. Besides, this paper also critically analyzes and summarizes the emphasized 
techniques proposed in the prior published research work in the contemporary literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

 
Cloud environment is being adopted at a large scale by many organizations. However, data security and data 
privacy  are  of  prime  concerns  in  cloud.  For  more  flexibility  and  enhanced  security,  a  hybrid  technique  which 
combines multiple encryption algorithms  such as RSA, Triple DES (3DES) and Random Number Generator has 
been  proposed  in  [1].Triple  DES  is  particularly  useful  for  encryption  of  block  data  and  RSA  is  useful  for 
establishing  secure  communication  connection  through  digital  signature  based  authentication.  Pagano  et  al.[2] 
proposed an In-Memory Database encryption technique for privacy and security of sensitive data over un-trusted 
cloud environment. For this purpose, there should be a synchronizer between the owner and the client seeking access 
to the data. Client would require a key from the synchronizer to decrypt the encrypted shared data it receives from 
the owner. The purpose of the synchronizer will be to store the correlated shared data and the keys separately. A 
caveat  with  this  technique  is  that  the  delay  can  occur  due  to  the  additional  communication  with  the  central 
synchronizer.  However,  this  limitation  can  be  mitigated  by  adopting  group  encryption  and  through  minimizing 
communication between nodes and synchronizer. 

Huang et al. [3] proposed a new asymmetric encryption mechanism which is applied to the databases in the 
cloud.  The  proposed  technique  follows  the  concept  of  commutative  encryption  and  ElGamal  encryption.  The 
commutative  encryption  is  applied  on  data  more  than  once  and  the  order  of  public/private  key  used  for 
encryption/decryption  does not  matter.  Re-encryption mechanism also takes place in the proposed scheme  which 
shows  that  the  cipher-text  data  is  encrypted  once  again  for  duality.  Such  schemes  are  very  useful  in  cloud 
applications where privacy is a key concern. 

Alzain et al. [4] emphasize that most of the security issues related to data privacy in cloud computing have not 
been addressed yet. Integrity of data, intrusion and availability of service in cloud are of prime concern. To ensure 
data integrity, one option could be to store data in multiple clouds or cloud databases. For this purpose, Shamir’s 
Secret Algorithm can be used. The data to be protected from internal or external unauthorized access is divided into 
chunks and Shamir’s Secret Algorithm generates a polynomial function against each chunk. The processed data is

then stored into different CSPs. Another alternative is to use a hybrid technique which uses both key sharing and 
authentication techniques [5] for data confidentiality and integrity. The connectivity between user and the CSP can 
be made more secure by utilizing powerful key sharing and authentication processes. RSA public key algorithm can 
be used  for secure distribution of the keys between the user and CSPs. A three layered data security technique is 
proposed by Eman et al.[6]. The first layer is used for authenticity of the cloud user either by one factor or by two 
factor authentication. The second layer encrypts the user’s data for ensuring protection and privacy. The third layer 
does fast recovery of data through a speedy decryption process. 

Delettre et al. [7]introduced a concealment concept for databases security. Data concealment approaches merge 
real  data  with  the  visual  fake  data  to  falsify  the  real  data’s  volume.  However,  authorized  users  can  easily 
differentiate and separate the fake data from the real data. Such techniques somehow increase the overall volume of 
real data, but provide enhanced security for private data. The objective of data concealment is to make the real data 
safe and secure from malicious users and attackers. Watermarking method can serve as a key for the real data. Only 
the authorized user s have key of watermarking. Manivannam et al. [8] have proposed a lightweight mechanism for 
database encryption known as Transposition, Substitution, Folding and Shifting (TSFS) algorithm. However, as the 
numbers of keys are increased, the amount of computations and processing also increases. 

Perveen et al. [9] has proposed a technique known as security as a service for securing cloud data. Like other 
services, this service would  be available on demand. The proposed technique can achieve maximum security  by 
dividing the user’s data into pieces. These data chunks are then encrypted and stored in separate databases which 
follow the concept of data distribution over cloud. As each sub-piece of data is encrypted and separately distributed 
in databases over cloud, this provides enhanced security against different types of attacks. Asad et al. [10] describe 
the distribution of resources  for cloud computing based on tailored active measurement. The main theme of this 
technique  is  based  on  network  design,  the  specific  routes  for  the  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  and  gradually 
changing the resources as per the needs of the user. Tailored measurement relies on the computing resources and 
storage resources. Due to the variable nature of networks, the allocation of the resources at a particular time based 
on tailored active method does not remain optimal. Due to variable nature of cloud, it possible that the resources 
may increases or decreases, and to counter this, we have to optimize changes in the user requirement either offline or 
online and the resource connectivity. 

The cloud computing facilitates huge amount of shared resources  on the Internet.  Cloud systems  should  be 
capable of averting DoS attacks.Shen et al.[11]analyzed requirement of security services in cloud computing and 
suggest  integrating  cloud  services  for  trusted  computing  platform  (TCP)  and  trusted  platform  support  services 
(TSS).  The  trusted  model  should  bear  characteristics  of  confidentiality,  dynamically  building  trust  domains  and 
dynamic of the services. Normally, the cloud infrastructures require that user transfers their data into cloud merely 
based on trust.Neisse et al.[12]analysindifferent attacks scenarios on Xen cloud platform to evaluate cloud services 
based on trust. Security of data and trust in cloud computing is the key point for its broader adoption. Yeluriet al. 
[13]focused on cloud services from security point of view and explore security challenges in cloud when deploying 
the services. Identity management, data recovery and management, security in cloud confidentiality, trust, visibility 
and application architecture are the key points for ensuring security in cloud computing. 

The overall picture of grid computing has been changed by cloud computing and distribution of data is a new 
way of cloud computing. The security challenges in the cloud include threats, dataloss, service disruption, outside 
malicious attacks and multi-tenancy issues [14].Chen et al. [15] analyse privacy and data security issues in cloud 
computing  by  focusing  on  privacy  protection,  data  segregation  and  cloud  security.  Thedata  security  issues  are 
primarily  at  SPI  (SaaS,  PaaS,  IaaS)  level  and  the  major  challenge  in  cloud  computing  isdata  sharing.Cloud 
computing [16] provides a podium to use wide range of Internet-based services. But besides its advantages, it also 
increases  the security threat when a  trusted  third  party is involved. By involving a trusted  third  party,  there is a 
chance of heterogeneity of users which affects security in the cloud. A possible solution to this problem could be to 
use a trusted third party independent approach for Identity Management to use identity data on untrusted hosts.  

Squicciarini [17] has focused on problems of data leakage and loss of privacy in cloud computing. Different 
levels of protections can be used to prevent data leakage and privacy loss in the cloud. Cloud computing provides 
new business services that is based on demand. The cloud networks have been built through dynamic virtualization 
of hardware, software and datasets. Cloud security infrastructure and the trust reputation management play a vital

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing  is  generally  known  as  on  demand  service.  Cloud  computing  is  an  Internet  based  service 
which provides a new technique to use huge amount of shared resources. It is a flexible and potent service spreading 
its wings on IT industry at a very fast pace. It enables services to be consumed easily as and when needed. This 
archetype has developed substantial interest in the corporate sector and the academic world, and is changing the way 
to do business. The services of cloud computing are provided across the entire computing spectrum. Organizations 
with big infrastructures are moving and extending their business towards cloud computing to lower their cost and to 
free  their  best  technology  managers  to  focus  on  creating  strategic  differentiation.  In  this  cloud,  the  ultimate 
consumers who use the services of cloud do not need anything to connect or equip themselves and their hardware 
with anything and they can have access to their data just through the Internet connectivity. There is a cloud service 
provider  who  facilitates  services  and  manages  those  services  in  the  cloud.  The  cloud  provider  facilitates  all the 
services over the Internet and as a return the end users use services according to their business needs and pay the 
service provider accordingly.  The concept of cloud includes a number of implementations, based on the services 
they provide. For instance, Google Apps Engine, Microsoft Azure, Eucalyptus, Amazon, Rackspace and Open Stack 
are  some  popular  implementations  of  cloud  computing  by  the  world  renowned  companies.  In  addition,  ACME 
Enterprise implemented VMware based v Cloud for permitting multiple organizations to share computing resources. 
Applied Materials developed a desktop cloud for CAD to get rid of the expense of changing out desktop PCs too 
often. “Apps.gov” is a website that provides cloud-based computing services to U.S. government agencies. 

Cloud  computing  is  the  next  generation  paradigm  in  computation,  which  is  continuously  growing  and 
emerging. Cloud computing is a new era of computing which refers to both the applications and resources delivered 
on  demand  over  the  Internet  as  services.  The  hardware  and  software  resources  in  the  data  centers  that  provide 
diverse services over the network or the Internet to address the user requirements are called “cloud” [20]. According 
to  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  cloud  computing  provides  a  convenient  on  demand 
network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing  resources  [19].  Here,  resources  refer  to  computing 
applications,  network  resources,  platforms,  software  services,  virtual  servers  and  computing  infrastructure.  The 
cloud  computing  can  be  conceived  as  a  new  computing archetype  with an  implication  for  greater  elasticity  and 
availability at a minimal cost. The three well-known and commonly used service models in the cloud paradigm are 
IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. 

The cloud is growing day by day as it provides high performance computational services to the users at cheaper 
rates. The Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Rakespace® are clouds giants. There are other types of different clouds.

Public cloud is the property  of service provider and is used publically, private cloud refers to a property  of any 
company, and hybrid cloud is the blends of public and private cloud. Most of the cloud services are being provided 
by large cloud service companies such as Google, Amazon, and IBM. 

There  can  be  three  main  types  of  cloud  computing  services  which  the  provider  facilitates  with.  These  are 
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In SaaS, also 
known as software on demand, the software and its related data is spread on the cloud by the service provider and 
the user can access and use it through any web browser he/she works  with. In platform as a service, the service 
provider facilitates the user with set of software. PaaS is also known as solution stack as a platform. In infrastructure 
as a service the cloud service provider facilitates the users with virtual machines, servers and storage to enhance 
their business capabilities. Like types of cloud services there are cloud types also which are private, public and a 
hybrid cloud. A private cloud is a cloud in which only the authorized users can use and access the services provided 
by the provider. In pubic cloud anybody can use the cloud services whereas the hybrid cloud contains the concept of 
both public and private clouds. Though cloud computing can save an organization’s time and money but trusting the 
system is very much important because the real asset of any organization is the data which they share in the cloud to 
use the needed services either by putting it directly in the relational database, or eventually in a relational database 
through an application. Cloud computing brings a number of attributes that require special attention when it comes 
to trusting the system. The trust of the entire system depends on the data protection and prevention techniques used 
in it. Numerous different tools and techniques have been tested and introducedby the researchers for data protection 
and prevention to gain and remove the hurdle of trust but there are still gaps which needs attention and are required 
to be lined up by making these techniques much better and effective. 

Data retrieval and data security protection is the major issue in cloud computing. The security of database is 
very important for both local machine and cloud-based environment. There are certain drawbacks linked to cloud 
computing. The major issues include security, resource management and resource monitoring. Additionally, there 
are no standard rules and regulations to deploy the cloud, and there is a lack of standardization in the cloud. From 
the security point of view, a number of novel techniques had been designed and implemented in cloud, but due to 
dynamicity  of  cloud  environment  these  techniques  fall  short  of  ensuring  total  security.  Though  cloud  cannot  be 
made 100% secure, but security risks can be minimized to certain extent so that users can freely adopt it. This paper 
is based on reviewing and analyzing different available tools and techniques for data protection and prevention in 
the environment of cloud computing. Besides, this paper also critically analyzes and summarizes the emphasized 
techniques proposed in the prior published research work in the contemporary literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

 
Cloud environment is being adopted at a large scale by many organizations. However, data security and data 
privacy  are  of  prime  concerns  in  cloud.  For  more  flexibility  and  enhanced  security,  a  hybrid  technique  which 
combines multiple encryption algorithms  such as RSA, Triple DES (3DES) and Random Number Generator has 
been  proposed  in  [1].Triple  DES  is  particularly  useful  for  encryption  of  block  data  and  RSA  is  useful  for 
establishing  secure  communication  connection  through  digital  signature  based  authentication.  Pagano  et  al.[2] 
proposed an In-Memory Database encryption technique for privacy and security of sensitive data over un-trusted 
cloud environment. For this purpose, there should be a synchronizer between the owner and the client seeking access 
to the data. Client would require a key from the synchronizer to decrypt the encrypted shared data it receives from 
the owner. The purpose of the synchronizer will be to store the correlated shared data and the keys separately. A 
caveat  with  this  technique  is  that  the  delay  can  occur  due  to  the  additional  communication  with  the  central 
synchronizer.  However,  this  limitation  can  be  mitigated  by  adopting  group  encryption  and  through  minimizing 
communication between nodes and synchronizer. 

Huang et al. [3] proposed a new asymmetric encryption mechanism which is applied to the databases in the 
cloud.  The  proposed  technique  follows  the  concept  of  commutative  encryption  and  ElGamal  encryption.  The 
commutative  encryption  is  applied  on  data  more  than  once  and  the  order  of  public/private  key  used  for 
encryption/decryption  does not  matter.  Re-encryption mechanism also takes place in the proposed scheme  which 
shows  that  the  cipher-text  data  is  encrypted  once  again  for  duality.  Such  schemes  are  very  useful  in  cloud 
applications where privacy is a key concern. 

Alzain et al. [4] emphasize that most of the security issues related to data privacy in cloud computing have not 
been addressed yet. Integrity of data, intrusion and availability of service in cloud are of prime concern. To ensure 
data integrity, one option could be to store data in multiple clouds or cloud databases. For this purpose, Shamir’s 
Secret Algorithm can be used. The data to be protected from internal or external unauthorized access is divided into 
chunks and Shamir’s Secret Algorithm generates a polynomial function against each chunk. The processed data is 

55 

 

J. Basic. Appl. Sci. Res., 4(1)54-59, 2014 

then stored into different CSPs. Another alternative is to use a hybrid technique which uses both key sharing and 
authentication techniques [5] for data confidentiality and integrity. The connectivity between user and the CSP can 
be made more secure by utilizing powerful key sharing and authentication processes. RSA public key algorithm can 
be used  for secure distribution of the keys between the user and CSPs. A three layered data security technique is 
proposed by Eman et al.[6]. The first layer is used for authenticity of the cloud user either by one factor or by two 
factor authentication. The second layer encrypts the user’s data for ensuring protection and privacy. The third layer 
does fast recovery of data through a speedy decryption process. 

Delettre et al. [7]introduced a concealment concept for databases security. Data concealment approaches merge 
real  data  with  the  visual  fake  data  to  falsify  the  real  data’s  volume.  However,  authorized  users  can  easily 
differentiate and separate the fake data from the real data. Such techniques somehow increase the overall volume of 
real data, but provide enhanced security for private data. The objective of data concealment is to make the real data 
safe and secure from malicious users and attackers. Watermarking method can serve as a key for the real data. Only 
the authorized user s have key of watermarking. Manivannam et al. [8] have proposed a lightweight mechanism for 
database encryption known as Transposition, Substitution, Folding and Shifting (TSFS) algorithm. However, as the 
numbers of keys are increased, the amount of computations and processing also increases. 

Perveen et al. [9] has proposed a technique known as security as a service for securing cloud data. Like other 
services, this service would  be available on demand. The proposed technique can achieve maximum security  by 
dividing the user’s data into pieces. These data chunks are then encrypted and stored in separate databases which 
follow the concept of data distribution over cloud. As each sub-piece of data is encrypted and separately distributed 
in databases over cloud, this provides enhanced security against different types of attacks. Asad et al. [10] describe 
the distribution of resources  for cloud computing based on tailored active measurement. The main theme of this 
technique  is  based  on  network  design,  the  specific  routes  for  the  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  and  gradually 
changing the resources as per the needs of the user. Tailored measurement relies on the computing resources and 
storage resources. Due to the variable nature of networks, the allocation of the resources at a particular time based 
on tailored active method does not remain optimal. Due to variable nature of cloud, it possible that the resources 
may increases or decreases, and to counter this, we have to optimize changes in the user requirement either offline or 
online and the resource connectivity. 

The cloud computing facilitates huge amount of shared resources  on the Internet.  Cloud systems  should  be 
capable of averting DoS attacks.Shen et al.[11]analyzed requirement of security services in cloud computing and 
suggest  integrating  cloud  services  for  trusted  computing  platform  (TCP)  and  trusted  platform  support  services 
(TSS).  The  trusted  model  should  bear  characteristics  of  confidentiality,  dynamically  building  trust  domains  and 
dynamic of the services. Normally, the cloud infrastructures require that user transfers their data into cloud merely 
based on trust.Neisse et al.[12]analysindifferent attacks scenarios on Xen cloud platform to evaluate cloud services 
based on trust. Security of data and trust in cloud computing is the key point for its broader adoption. Yeluriet al. 
[13]focused on cloud services from security point of view and explore security challenges in cloud when deploying 
the services. Identity management, data recovery and management, security in cloud confidentiality, trust, visibility 
and application architecture are the key points for ensuring security in cloud computing. 

The overall picture of grid computing has been changed by cloud computing and distribution of data is a new 
way of cloud computing. The security challenges in the cloud include threats, dataloss, service disruption, outside 
malicious attacks and multi-tenancy issues [14].Chen et al. [15] analyse privacy and data security issues in cloud 
computing  by  focusing  on  privacy  protection,  data  segregation  and  cloud  security.  Thedata  security  issues  are 
primarily  at  SPI  (SaaS,  PaaS,  IaaS)  level  and  the  major  challenge  in  cloud  computing  isdata  sharing.Cloud 
computing [16] provides a podium to use wide range of Internet-based services. But besides its advantages, it also 
increases  the security threat when a  trusted  third  party is involved. By involving a trusted  third  party,  there is a 
chance of heterogeneity of users which affects security in the cloud. A possible solution to this problem could be to 
use a trusted third party independent approach for Identity Management to use identity data on untrusted hosts.  

Squicciarini [17] has focused on problems of data leakage and loss of privacy in cloud computing. Different 
levels of protections can be used to prevent data leakage and privacy loss in the cloud. Cloud computing provides 
new business services that is based on demand. The cloud networks have been built through dynamic virtualization 
of hardware, software and datasets. Cloud security infrastructure and the trust reputation management play a vital 
role  to  upgrading  the  cloud  services  [18].  The  Internet  access  security,  server  access  security,  program  access 
security and database security are the main security issues in the cloud. 

The  inherent  issues  of  data  security,  governance  and  management  with  respect  to  control  in  the  cloud 
computing are discussed in [21]. The major issues in cloud data security are: data privacy, data protection, data 
availability,  data  location  and  secure  transmission.  The  issue  of  storing  data  over  the  trans-boarder  servers  is  a 
serious concern of clients as cloud venders are governed by the local laws and, therefore, the cloud clients should be 

56 

Saeed et al.,2014 

cognizant of those laws. The data availability is also an important concern and service downtime must be according 
to  the  predefined  SLAs.  Moreover,  the  cloud  provider  should  ensure  the  data  security,  particularly  data 
confidentiality and integrity. The cloud provider should share all such concerns with the client and  a build trust 
relationship in this connection. The cloud vender should provide guarantees of data safety and explain jurisdiction of 
local laws to the clients. The main focus in the paper is on those data issues and challenges which are associated 
with data storage location and its relocation, cost, availability and security. 

The data confidentiality, authentication and access control issues in cloud computing could be addressed by 
increasing  the  cloud  reliability  and  trustworthiness  [22].  A  cryptographic  algorithm named  as  Diffie-Hellman  is 
proposed  in  [23]  for  secure  communication,  which  is  quite  dissimilar  to  the  key  distribution  management 
mechanism.  Such  a  system  normally  consists  of  three  modules:  administration,  authentication  and  encryption 
modules. Each module has different but interconnected functions. The administration module is used by the cloud 
provider for user registration and administration. While the authentication module is used for authentication of users, 
and encryption module is used for data encryption. The authentication realization is a two-way process. Firstly, the 
system requires the user to enter normal login and password, and then it generates one-time password and sends it 
on the user mobile for authentication. Once the one-time password is supplied, the system authenticates the user and 
grants access to the system. The system eliminates the cloud overload and prevents it from man in the middle attack. 
Sun et al. [24] highlight the key security, privacy and trust issues in existing environment of cloud computing 
and help users to recognize the tangible and intangible threats associated with its use. According to the authors, there 
are three major potential threats in cloud computing, namely the security, privacy and trust.  Security plays a vital 
role in current era of long dreamed vision of computing as utility. It can be divided into four sub-categories: safety 
mechanisms,  cloud  server  monitoring  or  tracing,  data  confidentiality  and  avoiding  malicious  insiders’  illegal 
operations  and  service  hijacking.  Furthermore,  the  authors  highlight  the  importance  of  data  privacy  in  cloud 
computing. It is a key point from user perspective; therefore, it is vital to understand its allied issues like user control 
over the data and legal jurisdiction requirements. Moreover, the trust is a complex relationship between cloud client 
and provider, and it should be planned prior to adopting the cloud milieu. The trust between cloud provider and 
client should be reliable and measurable to make the trustworthy decisions. The trust can be divided into four sub-
categories: trust evaluation, trust relationship, trust degree and trust monitoring.

3.  Motivation 

The systematic investigation of the data protection techniques and security challenges being faced in the area 
of cloud computing in order to address these issues as a future work served as a motivation to conduct this research 
work. The study also helped us to understand the current state of the research in this area and helped establish facts 
and reach new conclusions. 
 

4.   CRITICAL EVALUATION 

 
In this section, we provide summary of the critical review of the proposed techniques discussed in the previous 
section. The hybrid encryption technique proposed by Kaur [1] provides flexibility to the user by allowing them to 
use one or more algorithm altogether, however, with increase in the level of computation due to the selection of 
multiple encryption algorithms, the performance of query processing decreases. To technique proposed in [2] offers 
data privacy and security at row/column level of cloud database. Such a technique provides flexibility as well as data 
security  by  storing  clients’  data  in  the  In-Memory  Database  while  rest  of  data  in  the  synchronizer.  Likewise, 
Commutative Encryption which is a double encryption method is proposed by Huang [3] which provides enhanced 
security but at the computational cost. The concept of multi-cloud databases has been proposed in [4] for better data 
security purposes, but it is cost-intensive solution. Rao [5] proposed a centralized database security using two factor 
authentication which bears minimal cost. 

Enhanced  data  security  model  based  on  a  three  layered  architecture  is  proposed  by  Mohamed  [6]  which 
provides best encryption algorithm for data protection. Likewise, data concealment approach proposed in [7] adds 
fake data to the original data so that even if the data is stolen then still it remains meaningless  to the stealer.  A 
lightweight encryption model used in [8] is a good alternative for database security. Security as a service [9] can 
also be used to achieve maximum security by utilizing existing cloud resources and providing security on demand. 
To attain trust in cloud computing, Shen et al. [11] proposed a mechanism to integrate cloud service. The trust, data 
architecture, identity management, data protection, software isolation, and availability are the key area of interest 
discussed in [15]. A system for data encryption, authentication and data integrity is proposed in [19]. 
A summary of critical review of data protection techniques is provided in Table I below.

caveat  with  this  technique  is  that  the  delay  can  occur  due  to  the  additional  communication  with  the  central 
synchronizer.  However,  this  limitation  can  be  mitigated  by  adopting  group  encryption  and  through  minimizing 
communication between nodes and synchronizer. 

Huang et al. [3] proposed a new asymmetric encryption mechanism which is applied to the databases in the 
cloud.  The  proposed  technique  follows  the  concept  of  commutative  encryption  and  ElGamal  encryption.  The 
commutative  encryption  is  applied  on  data  more  than  once  and  the  order  of  public/private  key  used  for 
encryption/decryption  does not  matter.  Re-encryption mechanism also takes place in the proposed scheme  which 
shows  that  the  cipher-text  data  is  encrypted  once  again  for  duality.  Such  schemes  are  very  useful  in  cloud 
applications where privacy is a key concern. 

Alzain et al. [4] emphasize that most of the security issues related to data privacy in cloud computing have not 
been addressed yet. Integrity of data, intrusion and availability of service in cloud are of prime concern. To ensure 
data integrity, one option could be to store data in multiple clouds or cloud databases. For this purpose, Shamir’s 
Secret Algorithm can be used. The data to be protected from internal or external unauthorized access is divided into 
chunks and Shamir’s Secret Algorithm generates a polynomial function against each chunk. The processed data is 

55

then stored into different CSPs. Another alternative is to use a hybrid technique which uses both key sharing and 
authentication techniques [5] for data confidentiality and integrity. The connectivity between user and the CSP can 
be made more secure by utilizing powerful key sharing and authentication processes. RSA public key algorithm can 
be used  for secure distribution of the keys between the user and CSPs. A three layered data security technique is 
proposed by Eman et al.[6]. The first layer is used for authenticity of the cloud user either by one factor or by two 
factor authentication. The second layer encrypts the user’s data for ensuring protection and privacy. The third layer 
does fast recovery of data through a speedy decryption process. 

Delettre et al. [7]introduced a concealment concept for databases security. Data concealment approaches merge 
real  data  with  the  visual  fake  data  to  falsify  the  real  data’s  volume.  However,  authorized  users  can  easily 
differentiate and separate the fake data from the real data. Such techniques somehow increase the overall volume of 
real data, but provide enhanced security for private data. The objective of data concealment is to make the real data 
safe and secure from malicious users and attackers. Watermarking method can serve as a key for the real data. Only 
the authorized user s have key of watermarking. Manivannam et al. [8] have proposed a lightweight mechanism for 
database encryption known as Transposition, Substitution, Folding and Shifting (TSFS) algorithm. However, as the 
numbers of keys are increased, the amount of computations and processing also increases. 

Perveen et al. [9] has proposed a technique known as security as a service for securing cloud data. Like other 
services, this service would  be available on demand. The proposed technique can achieve maximum security  by 
dividing the user’s data into pieces. These data chunks are then encrypted and stored in separate databases which 
follow the concept of data distribution over cloud. As each sub-piece of data is encrypted and separately distributed 
in databases over cloud, this provides enhanced security against different types of attacks. Asad et al. [10] describe 
the distribution of resources  for cloud computing based on tailored active measurement. The main theme of this 
technique  is  based  on  network  design,  the  specific  routes  for  the  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  and  gradually 
changing the resources as per the needs of the user. Tailored measurement relies on the computing resources and 
storage resources. Due to the variable nature of networks, the allocation of the resources at a particular time based 
on tailored active method does not remain optimal. Due to variable nature of cloud, it possible that the resources 
may increases or decreases, and to counter this, we have to optimize changes in the user requirement either offline or 
online and the resource connectivity. 

The cloud computing facilitates huge amount of shared resources  on the Internet.  Cloud systems  should  be 
capable of averting DoS attacks.Shen et al.[11]analyzed requirement of security services in cloud computing and 
suggest  integrating  cloud  services  for  trusted  computing  platform  (TCP)  and  trusted  platform  support  services 
(TSS).  The  trusted  model  should  bear  characteristics  of  confidentiality,  dynamically  building  trust  domains  and 
dynamic of the services. Normally, the cloud infrastructures require that user transfers their data into cloud merely 
based on trust.Neisse et al.[12]analysindifferent attacks scenarios on Xen cloud platform to evaluate cloud services 
based on trust. Security of data and trust in cloud computing is the key point for its broader adoption. Yeluriet al. 
[13]focused on cloud services from security point of view and explore security challenges in cloud when deploying 
the services. Identity management, data recovery and management, security in cloud confidentiality, trust, visibility 
and application architecture are the key points for ensuring security in cloud computing. 

The overall picture of grid computing has been changed by cloud computing and distribution of data is a new 
way of cloud computing. The security challenges in the cloud include threats, dataloss, service disruption, outside 
malicious attacks and multi-tenancy issues [14].Chen et al. [15] analyse privacy and data security issues in cloud 
computing  by  focusing  on  privacy  protection,  data  segregation  and  cloud  security.  Thedata  security  issues  are 
primarily  at  SPI  (SaaS,  PaaS,  IaaS)  level  and  the  major  challenge  in  cloud  computing  isdata  sharing.Cloud 
computing [16] provides a podium to use wide range of Internet-based services. But besides its advantages, it also 
increases  the security threat when a  trusted  third  party is involved. By involving a trusted  third  party,  there is a 
chance of heterogeneity of users which affects security in the cloud. A possible solution to this problem could be to 
use a trusted third party independent approach for Identity Management to use identity data on untrusted hosts.  

Squicciarini [17] has focused on problems of data leakage and loss of privacy in cloud computing. Different 
levels of protections can be used to prevent data leakage and privacy loss in the cloud. Cloud computing provides 
new business services that is based on demand. The cloud networks have been built through dynamic virtualization 
of hardware, software and datasets. Cloud security infrastructure and the trust reputation management play a vital 
role  to  upgrading  the  cloud  services  [18].  The  Internet  access  security,  server  access  security,  program  access 
security and database security are the main security issues in the cloud. 

The  inherent  issues  of  data  security,  governance  and  management  with  respect  to  control  in  the  cloud 
computing are discussed in [21]. The major issues in cloud data security are: data privacy, data protection, data 
availability,  data  location  and  secure  transmission.  The  issue  of  storing  data  over  the  trans-boarder  servers  is  a 
serious concern of clients as cloud venders are governed by the local laws and, therefore, the cloud clients should be 

56 

Saeed et al.,2014 

cognizant of those laws. The data availability is also an important concern and service downtime must be according 
to  the  predefined  SLAs.  Moreover,  the  cloud  provider  should  ensure  the  data  security,  particularly  data 
confidentiality and integrity. The cloud provider should share all such concerns with the client and  a build trust 
relationship in this connection. The cloud vender should provide guarantees of data safety and explain jurisdiction of 
local laws to the clients. The main focus in the paper is on those data issues and challenges which are associated 
with data storage location and its relocation, cost, availability and security. 

The data confidentiality, authentication and access control issues in cloud computing could be addressed by 
increasing  the  cloud  reliability  and  trustworthiness  [22].  A  cryptographic  algorithm named  as  Diffie-Hellman  is 
proposed  in  [23]  for  secure  communication,  which  is  quite  dissimilar  to  the  key  distribution  management 
mechanism.  Such  a  system  normally  consists  of  three  modules:  administration,  authentication  and  encryption 
modules. Each module has different but interconnected functions. The administration module is used by the cloud 
provider for user registration and administration. While the authentication module is used for authentication of users, 
and encryption module is used for data encryption. The authentication realization is a two-way process. Firstly, the 
system requires the user to enter normal login and password, and then it generates one-time password and sends it 
on the user mobile for authentication. Once the one-time password is supplied, the system authenticates the user and 
grants access to the system. The system eliminates the cloud overload and prevents it from man in the middle attack. 
Sun et al. [24] highlight the key security, privacy and trust issues in existing environment of cloud computing 
and help users to recognize the tangible and intangible threats associated with its use. According to the authors, there 
are three major potential threats in cloud computing, namely the security, privacy and trust.  Security plays a vital 
role in current era of long dreamed vision of computing as utility. It can be divided into four sub-categories: safety 
mechanisms,  cloud  server  monitoring  or  tracing,  data  confidentiality  and  avoiding  malicious  insiders’  illegal 
operations  and  service  hijacking.  Furthermore,  the  authors  highlight  the  importance  of  data  privacy  in  cloud 
computing. It is a key point from user perspective; therefore, it is vital to understand its allied issues like user control 
over the data and legal jurisdiction requirements. Moreover, the trust is a complex relationship between cloud client 
and provider, and it should be planned prior to adopting the cloud milieu. The trust between cloud provider and 
client should be reliable and measurable to make the trustworthy decisions. The trust can be divided into four sub-
categories: trust evaluation, trust relationship, trust degree and trust monitoring.

3.  Motivation 

The systematic investigation of the data protection techniques and security challenges being faced in the area 
of cloud computing in order to address these issues as a future work served as a motivation to conduct this research 
work. The study also helped us to understand the current state of the research in this area and helped establish facts 
and reach new conclusions. 
 

4.   CRITICAL EVALUATION 

 
In this section, we provide summary of the critical review of the proposed techniques discussed in the previous 
section. The hybrid encryption technique proposed by Kaur [1] provides flexibility to the user by allowing them to 
use one or more algorithm altogether, however, with increase in the level of computation due to the selection of 
multiple encryption algorithms, the performance of query processing decreases. To technique proposed in [2] offers 
data privacy and security at row/column level of cloud database. Such a technique provides flexibility as well as data 
security  by  storing  clients’  data  in  the  In-Memory  Database  while  rest  of  data  in  the  synchronizer.  Likewise, 
Commutative Encryption which is a double encryption method is proposed by Huang [3] which provides enhanced 
security but at the computational cost. The concept of multi-cloud databases has been proposed in [4] for better data 
security purposes, but it is cost-intensive solution. Rao [5] proposed a centralized database security using two factor 
authentication which bears minimal cost. 

Enhanced  data  security  model  based  on  a  three  layered  architecture  is  proposed  by  Mohamed  [6]  which 
provides best encryption algorithm for data protection. Likewise, data concealment approach proposed in [7] adds 
fake data to the original data so that even if the data is stolen then still it remains meaningless  to the stealer.  A 
lightweight encryption model used in [8] is a good alternative for database security. Security as a service [9] can 
also be used to achieve maximum security by utilizing existing cloud resources and providing security on demand. 
To attain trust in cloud computing, Shen et al. [11] proposed a mechanism to integrate cloud service. The trust, data 
architecture, identity management, data protection, software isolation, and availability are the key area of interest 
discussed in [15]. A system for data encryption, authentication and data integrity is proposed in [19].

CONCLUSION ANDFUTURE WORK 
The  barrier  and  hurdles  towards  the  rapid  growth  of  cloud  computing  are  the  security  and  privacy  issues 
associated with it. Reducing data processing cost is a mandatory requirement of any organization, but the data and 
information  is  always  the  asset  and  the  backbone  of  any  organization.  No  organization  can  transfer  its  data  or 
information to a third party system until and unless a bridge of trust is build. A number of techniques have been 
proposed by the researchers for data protection and to attain highest level of data security, but there are still many 
gaps that need to be filled by making these techniques more effective. Lot more work is required in the area of cloud 
computing to make it acceptable by the clients. This paper highlighted different techniques for data protection in the 
cloud  computing  environments  to  build  trust.  Besides,  this  study  also  critically  analyzed  and  summarized  the 
highlighted techniques proposed in the prior published research. As a future dimension to this work, the research 
will be conducted for the improved, efficient and secured framework for data protection and prevention to gain trust 
in cloud computing by providing maximum data security.

  ABSTRACT 

 
 
Data security has always remained a major issue in IT, but in cloud it is particularly of serious concern since data is 
scattered at different places all over the globe. The security concerns of users’ needs to be rectified to make cloud 
environment trustworthy. In cloud computing, a trustworthy environment is the basic prerequisite to win confidence 
of a user to adopt such technology. Data protection and security are the two main foremost factors for gaining user 
trust  and  making  the  cloud  successful.  A  number  of  data  protections  and  data  security  techniques  have  been 
proposed in the contemporary studies in the field of cloud computing; nonetheless, there are still new avenues to 
further  enhance  data  protection  related  techniques.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  review  different  security 
techniques  and  challenges  for  securing  and  protecting  data  in the  cloud  and  constitutes  trust  to  make  the  cloud 
trustworthy. This paper presents a comparative research analysis of the existing research work done regarding the 
techniques used in cloud computing and brings out certain gaps. Finally, we bring some vital guidelines for gaining 
trust by securing data in the cloud.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Cloud  computing  is  generally  known  as  on  demand  service.  Cloud  computing  is  an  Internet  based  service 
which provides a new technique to use huge amount of shared resources. It is a flexible and potent service spreading 
its wings on IT industry at a very fast pace. It enables services to be consumed easily as and when needed. This 
archetype has developed substantial interest in the corporate sector and the academic world, and is changing the way 
to do business. The services of cloud computing are provided across the entire computing spectrum. Organizations 
with big infrastructures are moving and extending their business towards cloud computing to lower their cost and to 
free  their  best  technology  managers  to  focus  on  creating  strategic  differentiation.  In  this  cloud,  the  ultimate 
consumers who use the services of cloud do not need anything to connect or equip themselves and their hardware 
with anything and they can have access to their data just through the Internet connectivity. There is a cloud service 
provider  who  facilitates  services  and  manages  those  services  in  the  cloud.  The  cloud  provider  facilitates  all the 
services over the Internet and as a return the end users use services according to their business needs and pay the 
service provider accordingly.  The concept of cloud includes a number of implementations, based on the services 
they provide. For instance, Google Apps Engine, Microsoft Azure, Eucalyptus, Amazon, Rackspace and Open Stack 
are  some  popular  implementations  of  cloud  computing  by  the  world  renowned  companies.  In  addition,  ACME 
Enterprise implemented VMware based v Cloud for permitting multiple organizations to share computing resources. 
Applied Materials developed a desktop cloud for CAD to get rid of the expense of changing out desktop PCs too 
often. “Apps.gov” is a website that provides cloud-based computing services to U.S. government agencies. 

Cloud  computing  is  the  next  generation  paradigm  in  computation,  which  is  continuously  growing  and 
emerging. Cloud computing is a new era of computing which refers to both the applications and resources delivered 
on  demand  over  the  Internet  as  services.  The  hardware  and  software  resources  in  the  data  centers  that  provide 
diverse services over the network or the Internet to address the user requirements are called “cloud” [20]. According 
to  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  cloud  computing  provides  a  convenient  on  demand 
network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing  resources  [19].  Here,  resources  refer  to  computing 
applications,  network  resources,  platforms,  software  services,  virtual  servers  and  computing  infrastructure.  The 
cloud  computing  can  be  conceived  as  a  new  computing archetype  with an  implication  for  greater  elasticity  and 
availability at a minimal cost. The three well-known and commonly used service models in the cloud paradigm are 
IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. 

The cloud is growing day by day as it provides high performance computational services to the users at cheaper 
rates. The Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Rakespace® are clouds giants. There are other types of different clouds.

Public cloud is the property  of service provider and is used publically, private cloud refers to a property  of any 
company, and hybrid cloud is the blends of public and private cloud. Most of the cloud services are being provided 
by large cloud service companies such as Google, Amazon, and IBM. 

There  can  be  three  main  types  of  cloud  computing  services  which  the  provider  facilitates  with.  These  are 
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In SaaS, also 
known as software on demand, the software and its related data is spread on the cloud by the service provider and 
the user can access and use it through any web browser he/she works  with. In platform as a service, the service 
provider facilitates the user with set of software. PaaS is also known as solution stack as a platform. In infrastructure 
as a service the cloud service provider facilitates the users with virtual machines, servers and storage to enhance 
their business capabilities. Like types of cloud services there are cloud types also which are private, public and a 
hybrid cloud. A private cloud is a cloud in which only the authorized users can use and access the services provided 
by the provider. In pubic cloud anybody can use the cloud services whereas the hybrid cloud contains the concept of 
both public and private clouds. Though cloud computing can save an organization’s time and money but trusting the 
system is very much important because the real asset of any organization is the data which they share in the cloud to 
use the needed services either by putting it directly in the relational database, or eventually in a relational database 
through an application. Cloud computing brings a number of attributes that require special attention when it comes 
to trusting the system. The trust of the entire system depends on the data protection and prevention techniques used 
in it. Numerous different tools and techniques have been tested and introducedby the researchers for data protection 
and prevention to gain and remove the hurdle of trust but there are still gaps which needs attention and are required 
to be lined up by making these techniques much better and effective. 

Data retrieval and data security protection is the major issue in cloud computing. The security of database is 
very important for both local machine and cloud-based environment. There are certain drawbacks linked to cloud 
computing. The major issues include security, resource management and resource monitoring. Additionally, there 
are no standard rules and regulations to deploy the cloud, and there is a lack of standardization in the cloud. From 
the security point of view, a number of novel techniques had been designed and implemented in cloud, but due to 
dynamicity  of  cloud  environment  these  techniques  fall  short  of  ensuring  total  security.  Though  cloud  cannot  be 
made 100% secure, but security risks can be minimized to certain extent so that users can freely adopt it. This paper 
is based on reviewing and analyzing different available tools and techniques for data protection and prevention in 
the environment of cloud computing. Besides, this paper also critically analyzes and summarizes the emphasized 
techniques proposed in the prior published research work in the contemporary literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

 
Cloud environment is being adopted at a large scale by many organizations. However, data security and data 
privacy  are  of  prime  concerns  in  cloud.  For  more  flexibility  and  enhanced  security,  a  hybrid  technique  which 
combines multiple encryption algorithms  such as RSA, Triple DES (3DES) and Random Number Generator has 
been  proposed  in  [1].Triple  DES  is  particularly  useful  for  encryption  of  block  data  and  RSA  is  useful  for 
establishing  secure  communication  connection  through  digital  signature  based  authentication.  Pagano  et  al.[2] 
proposed an In-Memory Database encryption technique for privacy and security of sensitive data over un-trusted 
cloud environment. For this purpose, there should be a synchronizer between the owner and the client seeking access 
to the data. Client would require a key from the synchronizer to decrypt the encrypted shared data it receives from 
the owner. The purpose of the synchronizer will be to store the correlated shared data and the keys separately. A 
caveat  with  this  technique  is  that  the  delay  can  occur  due  to  the  additional  communication  with  the  central 
synchronizer.  However,  this  limitation  can  be  mitigated  by  adopting  group  encryption  and  through  minimizing 
communication between nodes and synchronizer. 

Huang et al. [3] proposed a new asymmetric encryption mechanism which is applied to the databases in the 
cloud.  The  proposed  technique  follows  the  concept  of  commutative  encryption  and  ElGamal  encryption.  The 
commutative  encryption  is  applied  on  data  more  than  once  and  the  order  of  public/private  key  used  for 
encryption/decryption  does not  matter.  Re-encryption mechanism also takes place in the proposed scheme  which 
shows  that  the  cipher-text  data  is  encrypted  once  again  for  duality.  Such  schemes  are  very  useful  in  cloud 
applications where privacy is a key concern. 

Alzain et al. [4] emphasize that most of the security issues related to data privacy in cloud computing have not 
been addressed yet. Integrity of data, intrusion and availability of service in cloud are of prime concern. To ensure 
data integrity, one option could be to store data in multiple clouds or cloud databases. For this purpose, Shamir’s 
Secret Algorithm can be used. The data to be protected from internal or external unauthorized access is divided into 
chunks and Shamir’s Secret Algorithm generates a polynomial function against each chunk. The processed data is 

55

then stored into different CSPs. Another alternative is to use a hybrid technique which uses both key sharing and 
authentication techniques [5] for data confidentiality and integrity. The connectivity between user and the CSP can 
be made more secure by utilizing powerful key sharing and authentication processes. RSA public key algorithm can 
be used  for secure distribution of the keys between the user and CSPs. A three layered data security technique is 
proposed by Eman et al.[6]. The first layer is used for authenticity of the cloud user either by one factor or by two 
factor authentication. The second layer encrypts the user’s data for ensuring protection and privacy. The third layer 
does fast recovery of data through a speedy decryption process. 

Delettre et al. [7]introduced a concealment concept for databases security. Data concealment approaches merge 
real  data  with  the  visual  fake  data  to  falsify  the  real  data’s  volume.  However,  authorized  users  can  easily 
differentiate and separate the fake data from the real data. Such techniques somehow increase the overall volume of 
real data, but provide enhanced security for private data. The objective of data concealment is to make the real data 
safe and secure from malicious users and attackers. Watermarking method can serve as a key for the real data. Only 
the authorized user s have key of watermarking. Manivannam et al. [8] have proposed a lightweight mechanism for 
database encryption known as Transposition, Substitution, Folding and Shifting (TSFS) algorithm. However, as the 
numbers of keys are increased, the amount of computations and processing also increases. 

Perveen et al. [9] has proposed a technique known as security as a service for securing cloud data. Like other 
services, this service would  be available on demand. The proposed technique can achieve maximum security  by 
dividing the user’s data into pieces. These data chunks are then encrypted and stored in separate databases which 
follow the concept of data distribution over cloud. As each sub-piece of data is encrypted and separately distributed 
in databases over cloud, this provides enhanced security against different types of attacks. Asad et al. [10] describe 
the distribution of resources  for cloud computing based on tailored active measurement. The main theme of this 
technique  is  based  on  network  design,  the  specific  routes  for  the  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  and  gradually 
changing the resources as per the needs of the user. Tailored measurement relies on the computing resources and 
storage resources. Due to the variable nature of networks, the allocation of the resources at a particular time based 
on tailored active method does not remain optimal. Due to variable nature of cloud, it possible that the resources 
may increases or decreases, and to counter this, we have to optimize changes in the user requirement either offline or 
online and the resource connectivity. 

The cloud computing facilitates huge amount of shared resources  on the Internet.  Cloud systems  should  be 
capable of averting DoS attacks.Shen et al.[11]analyzed requirement of security services in cloud computing and 
suggest  integrating  cloud  services  for  trusted  computing  platform  (TCP)  and  trusted  platform  support  services

dynamic of the services. Normally, the cloud infrastructures require that user transfers their data into cloud merely 
based on trust.Neisse et al.[12]analysindifferent attacks scenarios on Xen cloud platform to evaluate cloud services 
based on trust. Security of data and trust in cloud computing is the key point for its broader adoption. Yeluriet al. 
[13]focused on cloud services from security point of view and explore security challenges in cloud when deploying 
the services. Identity management, data recovery and management, security in cloud confidentiality, trust, visibility 
and application architecture are the key points for ensuring security in cloud computing. 

The overall picture of grid computing has been changed by cloud computing and distribution of data is a new 
way of cloud computing. The security challenges in the cloud include threats, dataloss, service disruption, outside 
malicious attacks and multi-tenancy issues [14].Chen et al. [15] analyse privacy and data security issues in cloud 
computing  by  focusing  on  privacy  protection,  data  segregation  and  cloud  security.  Thedata  security  issues  are 
primarily  at  SPI  (SaaS,  PaaS,  IaaS)  level  and  the  major  challenge  in  cloud  computing  isdata  sharing.Cloud 
computing [16] provides a podium to use wide range of Internet-based services. But besides its advantages, it also 
increases  the security threat when a  trusted  third  party is involved. By involving a trusted  third  party,  there is a 
chance of heterogeneity of users which affects security in the cloud. A possible solution to this problem could be to 
use a trusted third party independent approach for Identity Management to use identity data on untrusted hosts.  

Squicciarini [17] has focused on problems of data leakage and loss of privacy in cloud computing. Different 
levels of protections can be used to prevent data leakage and privacy loss in the cloud. Cloud computing provides 
new business services that is based on demand. The cloud networks have been built through dynamic virtualization 
of hardware, software and datasets. Cloud security infrastructure and the trust reputation management play a vital 
role  to  upgrading  the  cloud  services  [18].  The  Internet  access  security,  server  access  security,  program  access 
security and database security are the main security issues in the cloud. 

The  inherent  issues  of  data  security,  governance  and  management  with  respect  to  control  in  the  cloud 
computing are discussed in [21]. The major issues in cloud data security are: data privacy, data protection, data 
availability,  data  location  and  secure  transmission.  The  issue  of  storing  data  over  the  trans-boarder  servers  is  a 
serious concern of clients as cloud venders are governed by the local laws and, therefore, the cloud clients should be 

56 

Saeed et al.,2014 

cognizant of those laws. The data availability is also an important concern and service downtime must be according 
to  the  predefined  SLAs.  Moreover,  the  cloud  provider  should  ensure  the  data  security,  particularly  data 
confidentiality and integrity. The cloud provider should share all such concerns with the client and  a build trust 
relationship in this connection. The cloud vender should provide guarantees of data safety and explain jurisdiction of 
local laws to the clients. The main focus in the paper is on those data issues and challenges which are associated 
with data storage location and its relocation, cost, availability and security. 

The data confidentiality, authentication and access control issues in cloud computing could be addressed by 
increasing  the  cloud  reliability  and  trustworthiness  [22].  A  cryptographic  algorithm named  as  Diffie-Hellman  is 
proposed  in  [23]  for  secure  communication,  which  is  quite  dissimilar  to  the  key  distribution  management 
mechanism.  Such  a  system  normally  consists  of  three  modules:  administration,  authentication  and  encryption 
modules. Each module has different but interconnected functions. The administration module is used by the cloud 
provider for user registration and administration. While the authentication module is used for authentication of users, 
and encryption module is used for data encryption. The authentication realization is a two-way process. Firstly, the 
system requires the user to enter normal login and password, and then it generates one-time password and sends it 
on the user mobile for authentication. Once the one-time password is supplied, the system authenticates the user and 
grants access to the system. The system eliminates the cloud overload and prevents it from man in the middle attack. 
Sun et al. [24] highlight the key security, privacy and trust issues in existing environment of cloud computing 
and help users to recognize the tangible and intangible threats associated with its use. According to the authors, there 
are three major potential threats in cloud computing, namely the security, privacy and trust.  Security plays a vital 
role in current era of long dreamed vision of computing as utility. It can be divided into four sub-categories: safety 
mechanisms,  cloud  server  monitoring  or  tracing,  data  confidentiality  and  avoiding  malicious  insiders’  illegal 
operations  and  service  hijacking.  Furthermore,  the  authors  highlight  the  importance  of  data  privacy  in  cloud 
computing. It is a key point from user perspective; therefore, it is vital to understand its allied issues like user control 
over the data and legal jurisdiction requirements. Moreover, the trust is a complex relationship between cloud client 
and provider, and it should be planned prior to adopting the cloud milieu. The trust between cloud provider and 
client should be reliable and measurable to make the trustworthy decisions. The trust can be divided into four sub-
categories: trust evaluation, trust relationship, trust degree and trust monitoring.

3.  Motivation 

The systematic investigation of the data protection techniques and security challenges being faced in the area 
of cloud computing in order to address these issues as a future work served as a motivation to conduct this research 
work. The study also helped us to understand the current state of the research in this area and helped establish facts 
and reach new conclusions. 
 

4.   CRITICAL EVALUATION 

 
In this section, we provide summary of the critical review of the proposed techniques discussed in the previous 
section. The hybrid encryption technique proposed by Kaur [1] provides flexibility to the user by allowing them to 
use one or more algorithm altogether, however, with increase in the level of computation due to the selection of 
multiple encryption algorithms, the performance of query processing decreases. To technique proposed in [2] offers 
data privacy and security at row/column level of cloud database. Such a technique provides flexibility as well as data 
security  by  storing  clients’  data  in  the  In-Memory  Database  while  rest  of  data  in  the  synchronizer.  Likewise, 
Commutative Encryption which is a double encryption method is proposed by Huang [3] which provides enhanced 
security but at the computational cost. The concept of multi-cloud databases has been proposed in [4] for better data 
security purposes, but it is cost-intensive solution. Rao [5] proposed a centralized database security using two factor 
authentication which bears minimal cost. 

Enhanced  data  security  model  based  on  a  three  layered  architecture  is  proposed  by  Mohamed  [6]  which 
provides best encryption algorithm for data protection. Likewise, data concealment approach proposed in [7] adds 
fake data to the original data so that even if the data is stolen then still it remains meaningless  to the stealer.  A 
lightweight encryption model used in [8] is a good alternative for database security. Security as a service [9] can 
also be used to achieve maximum security by utilizing existing cloud resources and providing security on demand. 
To attain trust in cloud computing, Shen et al. [11] proposed a mechanism to integrate cloud service. The trust, data 
architecture, identity management, data protection, software isolation, and availability are the key area of interest 
discussed in [15]. A system for data encryption, authentication and data integrity is proposed in [19]. 
A summary of critical review of data protection techniques is provided in Table I below.

CONCLUSION ANDFUTURE WORK 
The  barrier  and  hurdles  towards  the  rapid  growth  of  cloud  computing  are  the  security  and  privacy  issues 
associated with it. Reducing data processing cost is a mandatory requirement of any organization, but the data and 
information  is  always  the  asset  and  the  backbone  of  any  organization.  No  organization  can  transfer  its  data  or 
information to a third party system until and unless a bridge of trust is build. A number of techniques have been 
proposed by the researchers for data protection and to attain highest level of data security, but there are still many 
gaps that need to be filled by making these techniques more effective. Lot more work is required in the area of cloud 
computing to make it acceptable by the clients. This paper highlighted different techniques for data protection in the 
cloud  computing  environments  to  build  trust.  Besides,  this  study  also  critically  analyzed  and  summarized  the 
highlighted techniques proposed in the prior published research. As a future dimension to this work, the research 
will be conducted for the improved, efficient and secured framework for data protection and prevention to gain trust 
in cloud computing by providing maximum data security.
