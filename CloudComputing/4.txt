Services in cloud computing 

A. SaaS: 

Software as a Service (SaaS)[8] are probably the most popular form of cloud computing and are easy to use. SaaS 
uses the Web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the 
clients’  side.  Most  SaaS  applications  can  be  run  directly  from  a  Web  browser,  without  any  downloads  or 
installations required. SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers. With SaaS, 
it’s  easy  for  enterprises  to  streamline  their  maintenance  and  support,  because  everything  can  be  managed  by 
vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Examples for 
SaaS are Gmail , Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365 , Google+ , face book , yahoo. 

B. PaaS: 

Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)[8]  deliver  computational  resources  through  a  platform.  What  developers  gain  with 
PaaS  is  a  framework  they  can  build  upon  to  develop  or  customize  applications.  PaaS  makes  the  development, 
testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective, eliminating the need to buy the underlying 
layers  of  hardware  and  software.  One  comparison  between  SaaS  vs.  PaaS  has  to  do  with  what  aspects  must  be 
managed by users, rather than providers: With PaaS, vendors still manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, 
servers,  storage,  and  networking,  but  users  manage  applications  and  data.  Examples  for  PaaS  are  AWS  Elastic 
Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com and Google App Engine. 

C. IaaS 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)[8] delivers computer infrastructure (such as a platform virtualization environment), 
storage, and networking. Instead of having to purchase software, servers, or network equipment, users can buy these 
as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

Cloud Storage Models 

There  are  models  for  cloud  storage  that  allow  users  to  maintain  control  over  their  data.  Cloud  storage  [2]  has 
evolved  into  three  categories,  one  of  which  permits  the  merging  of  two  categories  for  a  cost-efficient  and  secure 
option. Public cloud storage providers, which present storage infrastructure as a leasable commodity (both in terms 
of long-term or short-term storage and the networking bandwidth used within the infrastructure). Private clouds use 
the concepts of public cloud storage but in a form that  can be securely embedded  within a user's firewall. Finally, 
hybrid cloud storage permits  the two  models to merge, allowing policies to define  which data must be maintained 
privately and which can be secured within public clouds (see Figure 6). 

 

Fig 1. Cloud storage models 

 

 

The cloud models are shown graphically in Figure 1. Examples of public cloud storage providers include Amazon 
(which  offers  storage  as  a  service).  Examples  of  private  cloud  storage  providers  include  IBM[1],  Para  scale,  and 
Clever  safe  (which  build  software  and/or  hardware  for  internal  clouds).  Finally,  hybrid  cloud  providers  include 
Egnyte, among others.

Data Storage Security techniques in cloud computing 

 
Various  existing  techniques  [2]  have  been  discussed  in  this  paper.  Cloud  storage  is  regarded  as  a  system  of 
disseminated data centers that generally Utilizes virtualization technology and supplies interface for data storage.

as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

magazine/Search  Storage  Purchasing  Intentions  survey,  14%  of  respondents  said  they're  using  cloud  storage  now, 
with the largest numbers using cloud storage  for disaster recovery (6%). But 4% are using it to  hold primary data 
from their data centers, and an equal number are using it for near line data storage. But before you take plunge and 
sign up with a cloud storage service provider, there are some things you need to know. Is cloud storage secure? How 
much  will  it  cost?  What  services  are  best  for  SMBs?  In  our  cloud  storage  services  guide  for  beginners,  we've 
collected our top tips and expert advice in one place so you can get answers to your most important questions. Learn

Cloud Storage Models 

There  are  models  for  cloud  storage  that  allow  users  to  maintain  control  over  their  data.  Cloud  storage  [2]  has 
evolved  into  three  categories,  one  of  which  permits  the  merging  of  two  categories  for  a  cost-efficient  and  secure 
option. Public cloud storage providers, which present storage infrastructure as a leasable commodity (both in terms 
of long-term or short-term storage and the networking bandwidth used within the infrastructure). Private clouds use 
the concepts of public cloud storage but in a form that  can be securely embedded  within a user's firewall. Finally, 
hybrid cloud storage permits  the two  models to merge, allowing policies to define  which data must be maintained 
privately and which can be secured within public clouds (see Figure 6). 

 

Fig 1. Cloud storage models 

 

 

The cloud models are shown graphically in Figure 1. Examples of public cloud storage providers include Amazon 
(which  offers  storage  as  a  service).  Examples  of  private  cloud  storage  providers  include  IBM[1],  Para  scale,  and 
Clever  safe  (which  build  software  and/or  hardware  for  internal  clouds).  Finally,  hybrid  cloud  providers  include 
Egnyte, among others.

Data Storage Security techniques in cloud computing 

 
Various  existing  techniques  [2]  have  been  discussed  in  this  paper.  Cloud  storage  is  regarded  as  a  system  of 
disseminated data centers that generally Utilizes virtualization technology and supplies interface for data storage.

identify  based  encryption  (IBE)  and  decryption  and 

A. Implicit Storage Security to Data in Online  
 
Providing  implicit  storage  security  to  data  in  online  is  more  beneficial  in  a  cloud  computing.  The  use  of  a  data 
partitioning scheme for implementing such security involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. In this scheme 
data is partitioned in such way that each portion is implicitly secure and does not to be encrypted. These portions are 
stored  on  different  servers  on  the  network  which  are  known  only  to  the  user.  Reconstruction  of  the  data  requires 
access  to  each  server  and  the  knowledge  as  to  which  servers  the  data  portions  are  stored.  Several  versions  of  this 
scheme are described, which include the implicit storage of encryption keys rather than the data and where a subset 
of the partition may be brought together to recreate the data.  
 
B. Identify –Based Authentication  
 
An 
identity  based  signature  IBS  schemes  for 
IBHMCC.Resources and services are distributed across numerous consumer. So there is a chance of various security 
risks.  Therefore  authentication  of  users  as  well  as  services  is  an  important  requirement  for  cloud  security.  When 
SSH  Authentication  protocol  (SAP)  was  employed  to  cloud,  it  becomes  very  complex.  As  an  alternative  to  SAP, 
proposed a new authentication protocol based on identity which is based on hierarchical model with corresponding 
signature and encryption scheme. Identify based authentication protocol constrains sequence of steps. In step (1) the 
client C sends the servers a client Hello message. The message contains a fresh random number Cn.session identifier 
ID  and  c  specification.  In  step  (2)  the  server  S  responds  with  a  server  Hello  message  which  contains  new  fresh 
random number Sn.  
 
C. Public Auditing with Complete Data Dynamic Support  
 
Verification  of  data  integrity  at  unreliable  servers  is  the  major  concern  in  cloud  storage  with  public  audit  ability 
trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not posses can be delegated as an external audit party to  
access  the  risk  of  outsourced  data  when  needed.  It  also  provides  a  transparent  yet  cost  effective  method  for  data 
owners  to  gain  trust  in  the  cloud.  To  accomplish,  dynamic  data  support,  the  existent  proof  read  of  PDF  (or) POR 
scheme is improved by spoofing the basic Markel Hash tree (MHT).  
 
D. Efficient Third Party Auditing (TPA)  
 
Cloud consumers save data in cloud server so that security  as  well as data storage correctness is primary concern. 
The data owners having huge amount of outsourced data and auditing the data correctness in a cloud environment 
can be difficult and expensive for data owners. To support third party auditing where user safely delegate in integrity 
checking  tasks  to  third  party  auditors(TPA)[2]  this  scheme  can  almost  guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of 
data  error(i.e.  the  identification  of  misbehaving  servers).  A  novel  and  homogeneous  structure  is  introduced  to 
provide security to different cloud types. To achieve data storage security, BLS (Bonch-Lynn-Sachems) algorithm is 
used  to  signing  the  data  blocks  before  outsourcing  data  into  cloud.  Reed  Solomon  technique  is  used  for  error 
correction and to ensure data storage correction.  
 
E. Way of Dynamically Store Data in Cloud  
 
Data storage is cloud may not be completely trustable because the clients did not have local copy of data stored in 
cloud. To address these issues proposed a new protocol system using the data reading protocol algorithm to check 
the data integrity services providers help the clients to check the data security by the proposed effective automatic 
data  reading  algorithm.  A  flexible  distributed  storage  integrity  auditing  mechanism  (FDSIAM),  these  mechanisms 
utilizes the homomorphism tokens, blocking erasure and unblocking factors and distributed erasure coded data.  
 
F. Effective and Secure Storage Protocol  
 
Current trend is users outsourcing data into service provider who have enough area for storage  with lower storage 
cost.  A  secure  and  efficient  storage  protocol  is  proposed  that  guarantees  the  data  storage  confidentiality  and 
integrity.  This  protocol  is  invented  by  using  the  construction  of  elliptic  curve  cryptography  and  sober  sequence  is 
used to confirm the data integrity[2]. Data and software process protocol step executed by cloud customers to add 
the privacy enforcement structure to the software and data before transferring them to the cloud. Challenge response

Abstract:  cloud  computing  has  been  envisioned  as  the  next  generation  architecture  of  IT  enterprise.  Cloud 
computing moves the application software and data bases to the large data centers, where the management of the 
data  and  services  may  not  be  fully  trustworthy.  This  poses  many  new  security  challenges  which  have  not  been 
fully implemented. In this paper, we mainly focus on aspects for providing security for data storage in cloud, also 
architecture for data storage   that are implemented by other service providers vendors   in cloud, key points for 
proving security for data storage. 

Keywords:  cloud computing, cloud storage techniques, security techniques, architecture, S3, API, TPA

Introduction 

Several trends are opening up the era of Cloud  Computing [9], which is an Internet-based development and use of 
computer  technology.  The  ever  cheaper  and  more  powerful  processors,  together  with  the  software  as  a  service 
(SaaS)[8]  computing  architecture,  are  transforming  data  centers  into  pools  of  computing  service  on  a  huge  scale. 
The increasing network bandwidth and reliable yet flexible network connections make it even possible that users can 
now subscribe high quality services from data and software that reside solely on remote data centers. Moving data 
into  the  cloud  offers  great  convenience  to  users  since  they  don’t  have  to  care  about  the  complexities  of  direct 
hardware  management.  The  pioneer  of  Cloud  Computing  vendors,  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (S3)[4]  and 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)[4] are both well known examples. While these internet-based online services 
do  provide  huge  amounts  of  storage  space  and  customizable  computing  resources,  this  computing  platform  shift, 
however, is eliminating the responsibility of local machines for data maintenance at the same time. As a result, users 
are at the mercy of their cloud service providers for the availability and integrity of their data. Recent downtime of

Amazon’s S3[4] is such an example. Benefits of Cloud storage: No need to invest any capital on storage devices, No 
need  for  technical  expert  to  maintain  the  storage,  backup,  replication  and  importantly  disaster  management, 
Allowing others to access your data will result with collaborative working style instead of individual work.

Services in cloud computing 

A. SaaS: 

Software as a Service (SaaS)[8] are probably the most popular form of cloud computing and are easy to use. SaaS 
uses the Web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the 
clients’  side.  Most  SaaS  applications  can  be  run  directly  from  a  Web  browser,  without  any  downloads  or 
installations required. SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers. With SaaS, 
it’s  easy  for  enterprises  to  streamline  their  maintenance  and  support,  because  everything  can  be  managed  by 
vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Examples for 
SaaS are Gmail , Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365 , Google+ , face book , yahoo. 

B. PaaS: 

Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)[8]  deliver  computational  resources  through  a  platform.  What  developers  gain  with 
PaaS  is  a  framework  they  can  build  upon  to  develop  or  customize  applications.  PaaS  makes  the  development, 
testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective, eliminating the need to buy the underlying 
layers  of  hardware  and  software.  One  comparison  between  SaaS  vs.  PaaS  has  to  do  with  what  aspects  must  be 
managed by users, rather than providers: With PaaS, vendors still manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, 
servers,  storage,  and  networking,  but  users  manage  applications  and  data.  Examples  for  PaaS  are  AWS  Elastic 
Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com and Google App Engine. 

C. IaaS 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)[8] delivers computer infrastructure (such as a platform virtualization environment), 
storage, and networking. Instead of having to purchase software, servers, or network equipment, users can buy these 
as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

Introduction 

Several trends are opening up the era of Cloud  Computing [9], which is an Internet-based development and use of 
computer  technology.  The  ever  cheaper  and  more  powerful  processors,  together  with  the  software  as  a  service 
(SaaS)[8]  computing  architecture,  are  transforming  data  centers  into  pools  of  computing  service  on  a  huge  scale. 
The increasing network bandwidth and reliable yet flexible network connections make it even possible that users can 
now subscribe high quality services from data and software that reside solely on remote data centers. Moving data 
into  the  cloud  offers  great  convenience  to  users  since  they  don’t  have  to  care  about  the  complexities  of  direct 
hardware  management.  The  pioneer  of  Cloud  Computing  vendors,  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (S3)[4]  and 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)[4] are both well known examples. While these internet-based online services 
do  provide  huge  amounts  of  storage  space  and  customizable  computing  resources,  this  computing  platform  shift, 
however, is eliminating the responsibility of local machines for data maintenance at the same time. As a result, users 
are at the mercy of their cloud service providers for the availability and integrity of their data. Recent downtime of

Amazon’s S3[4] is such an example. Benefits of Cloud storage: No need to invest any capital on storage devices, No 
need  for  technical  expert  to  maintain  the  storage,  backup,  replication  and  importantly  disaster  management, 
Allowing others to access your data will result with collaborative working style instead of individual work.  
 

II. 

Services in cloud computing 

A. SaaS: 

Software as a Service (SaaS)[8] are probably the most popular form of cloud computing and are easy to use. SaaS 
uses the Web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the 
clients’  side.  Most  SaaS  applications  can  be  run  directly  from  a  Web  browser,  without  any  downloads  or 
installations required. SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers. With SaaS, 
it’s  easy  for  enterprises  to  streamline  their  maintenance  and  support,  because  everything  can  be  managed  by 
vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Examples for 
SaaS are Gmail , Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365 , Google+ , face book , yahoo. 

B. PaaS: 

Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)[8]  deliver  computational  resources  through  a  platform.  What  developers  gain  with 
PaaS  is  a  framework  they  can  build  upon  to  develop  or  customize  applications.  PaaS  makes  the  development, 
testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective, eliminating the need to buy the underlying 
layers  of  hardware  and  software.  One  comparison  between  SaaS  vs.  PaaS  has  to  do  with  what  aspects  must  be 
managed by users, rather than providers: With PaaS, vendors still manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, 
servers,  storage,  and  networking,  but  users  manage  applications  and  data.  Examples  for  PaaS  are  AWS  Elastic 
Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com and Google App Engine. 

C. IaaS 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)[8] delivers computer infrastructure (such as a platform virtualization environment), 
storage, and networking. Instead of having to purchase software, servers, or network equipment, users can buy these 
as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

maximize  benefits  of  scale  and  to  pass  those  benefits  on  to  developers.  According  to  the  Spring  2010  Storage 
magazine/Search  Storage  Purchasing  Intentions  survey,  14%  of  respondents  said  they're  using  cloud  storage  now, 
with the largest numbers using cloud storage  for disaster recovery (6%). But 4% are using it to  hold primary data 
from their data centers, and an equal number are using it for near line data storage. But before you take plunge and 
sign up with a cloud storage service provider, there are some things you need to know. Is cloud storage secure? How 
much  will  it  cost?  What  services  are  best  for  SMBs?  In  our  cloud  storage  services  guide  for  beginners,  we've 
collected our top tips and expert advice in one place so you can get answers to your most important questions. Learn 
about cloud backup, cloud archiving, cloud disaster recovery, and using the cloud for primary storage.

Cloud Storage Models 

There  are  models  for  cloud  storage  that  allow  users  to  maintain  control  over  their  data.  Cloud  storage  [2]  has 
evolved  into  three  categories,  one  of  which  permits  the  merging  of  two  categories  for  a  cost-efficient  and  secure 
option. Public cloud storage providers, which present storage infrastructure as a leasable commodity (both in terms 
of long-term or short-term storage and the networking bandwidth used within the infrastructure). Private clouds use 
the concepts of public cloud storage but in a form that  can be securely embedded  within a user's firewall. Finally, 
hybrid cloud storage permits  the two  models to merge, allowing policies to define  which data must be maintained 
privately and which can be secured within public clouds (see Figure 6). 

 

Fig 1. Cloud storage models 

 

 

The cloud models are shown graphically in Figure 1. Examples of public cloud storage providers include Amazon 
(which  offers  storage  as  a  service).  Examples  of  private  cloud  storage  providers  include  IBM[1],  Para  scale,  and 
Clever  safe  (which  build  software  and/or  hardware  for  internal  clouds).  Finally,  hybrid  cloud  providers  include 
Egnyte, among others.

Data Storage Security techniques in cloud computing 

 
Various  existing  techniques  [2]  have  been  discussed  in  this  paper.  Cloud  storage  is  regarded  as  a  system  of 
disseminated data centers that generally Utilizes virtualization technology and supplies interface for data storage.

identify  based  encryption  (IBE)  and  decryption  and 

A. Implicit Storage Security to Data in Online  
 
Providing  implicit  storage  security  to  data  in  online  is  more  beneficial  in  a  cloud  computing.  The  use  of  a  data 
partitioning scheme for implementing such security involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. In this scheme 
data is partitioned in such way that each portion is implicitly secure and does not to be encrypted. These portions are 
stored  on  different  servers  on  the  network  which  are  known  only  to  the  user.  Reconstruction  of  the  data  requires 
access  to  each  server  and  the  knowledge  as  to  which  servers  the  data  portions  are  stored.  Several  versions  of  this 
scheme are described, which include the implicit storage of encryption keys rather than the data and where a subset 
of the partition may be brought together to recreate the data.  
 
B. Identify –Based Authentication  
 
An 
identity  based  signature  IBS  schemes  for 
IBHMCC.Resources and services are distributed across numerous consumer. So there is a chance of various security 
risks.  Therefore  authentication  of  users  as  well  as  services  is  an  important  requirement  for  cloud  security.  When 
SSH  Authentication  protocol  (SAP)  was  employed  to  cloud,  it  becomes  very  complex.  As  an  alternative  to  SAP, 
proposed a new authentication protocol based on identity which is based on hierarchical model with corresponding 
signature and encryption scheme. Identify based authentication protocol constrains sequence of steps. In step (1) the 
client C sends the servers a client Hello message. The message contains a fresh random number Cn.session identifier 
ID  and  c  specification.  In  step  (2)  the  server  S  responds  with  a  server  Hello  message  which  contains  new  fresh 
random number Sn.  
 
C. Public Auditing with Complete Data Dynamic Support  
 
Verification  of  data  integrity  at  unreliable  servers  is  the  major  concern  in  cloud  storage  with  public  audit  ability 
trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not posses can be delegated as an external audit party to  
access  the  risk  of  outsourced  data  when  needed.  It  also  provides  a  transparent  yet  cost  effective  method  for  data 
owners  to  gain  trust  in  the  cloud.  To  accomplish,  dynamic  data  support,  the  existent  proof  read  of  PDF  (or) POR 
scheme is improved by spoofing the basic Markel Hash tree (MHT).  
 
D. Efficient Third Party Auditing (TPA)  
 
Cloud consumers save data in cloud server so that security  as  well as data storage correctness is primary concern. 
The data owners having huge amount of outsourced data and auditing the data correctness in a cloud environment 
can be difficult and expensive for data owners. To support third party auditing where user safely delegate in integrity 
checking  tasks  to  third  party  auditors(TPA)[2]  this  scheme  can  almost  guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of 
data  error(i.e.  the  identification  of  misbehaving  servers).  A  novel  and  homogeneous  structure  is  introduced  to 
provide security to different cloud types. To achieve data storage security, BLS (Bonch-Lynn-Sachems) algorithm is 
used  to  signing  the  data  blocks  before  outsourcing  data  into  cloud.  Reed  Solomon  technique  is  used  for  error 
correction and to ensure data storage correction.  
 
E. Way of Dynamically Store Data in Cloud  
 
Data storage is cloud may not be completely trustable because the clients did not have local copy of data stored in 
cloud. To address these issues proposed a new protocol system using the data reading protocol algorithm to check 
the data integrity services providers help the clients to check the data security by the proposed effective automatic 
data  reading  algorithm.  A  flexible  distributed  storage  integrity  auditing  mechanism  (FDSIAM),  these  mechanisms 
utilizes the homomorphism tokens, blocking erasure and unblocking factors and distributed erasure coded data.  
 
F. Effective and Secure Storage Protocol  
 
Current trend is users outsourcing data into service provider who have enough area for storage  with lower storage 
cost.  A  secure  and  efficient  storage  protocol  is  proposed  that  guarantees  the  data  storage  confidentiality  and 
integrity.  This  protocol  is  invented  by  using  the  construction  of  elliptic  curve  cryptography  and  sober  sequence  is 
used to confirm the data integrity[2]. Data and software process protocol step executed by cloud customers to add 
the privacy enforcement structure to the software and data before transferring them to the cloud. Challenge response

protocol  is  protocol  is  credential  so  that  it  will  not  exposes  the  contents  of  the  data  to  outsiders.  Data  dynamic 
operations are also used keep the same security assurance and also provide relief to users from the difficult of data 
leakage and corruptions problems.  
 
G. Storage Security of Data  
 
The  data  is  secured  in  server  based  on  user’s  choice  of  security  method  so  that  data  is  given  high  secure  priority 
resources  are  being  shared  across  server  trouble  to  data  security  in  cloud.  Transmitting  data  over  internet  is 
dangerous  due  to  the  intruder  attacks  data  encryption  plays  an  important  role  in  cloud  environment.  Introduced  a 
consistent and novel  structure for providing security to cloud types and  implemented a secure cross platform. The 
proposed  effective  and  flexible  distribution  scheme  two-way  handshakes  based  on  token  management  by  utilizing 
the  homomorpic  token  with  distributed  verification  of  erasure  coded  data,  our  scheme  achieves  the  integration  of 
storage correctness insurance and data error location (i.e.) the identification of misbehaving server.  
 
H. Secure and Dependable Storage Service  
 
Storage service of permits consumers to the data in cloud as well as  allowed to utilize the available well qualified 
application  with no  worry data storage  maintained. Although cloud providers benefits, such a service gives  up  the 
self control of user’s data that introduced fresh valuability hazards to cloud data correctness. The proposed a flexible 
distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphism token and distributed coded-data. The 
proposed  design  further  support  secure  and  efficient  dynamic  operation  on  outsource  data  including  block 
modification, deletion and append.

Cloud  data  storage  which  requires  no  effort  is  acquiring  more  popularity  for  individual,  enteprise  and  institutions 
data  backup  and  synchrozation.  The  proposed  system  describes,  at  a  high  level,  a  possible  architecture  for  a

To support services extensively, Hadoop distributed file system server reasons are examined for small file trouble of

evolving.  There,  you  can  find  Web  service  front  ends,  file-based  front  ends,  and  even  more  traditional  front  ends 
(such as Internet SCSI, or iSCSI). Behind the  front end is a layer of  middleware that I  call the storage logic. This 
layer  implements  a  variety  of  features,  such  as  replication  and  data  reduction,  over  the  traditional  data-placement 
algorithms (with consideration for geographic placement). Finally, the back end implements the physical storage for 
data.  This  may  be  an  internal  protocol  that  implements  specific  features  or  a  traditional  back  end  to  the  physical 
disks.

From  Figure  2,  you  can  see  some  of  the  characteristics  for  current  cloud  storage  architectures[3].  Note  that  no 
characteristics  are  exclusive  in  the  particular  layer  but  serve  as  a  guide  for  specific  topics  that  addresses.  These 
characteristics are defined in table 1.

Several trends are opening up the era of Cloud  Computing [9], which is an Internet-based development and use of 
computer  technology.  The  ever  cheaper  and  more  powerful  processors,  together  with  the  software  as  a  service 
(SaaS)[8]  computing  architecture,  are  transforming  data  centers  into  pools  of  computing  service  on  a  huge  scale. 
The increasing network bandwidth and reliable yet flexible network connections make it even possible that users can 
now subscribe high quality services from data and software that reside solely on remote data centers. Moving data 
into  the  cloud  offers  great  convenience  to  users  since  they  don’t  have  to  care  about  the  complexities  of  direct 
hardware  management.  The  pioneer  of  Cloud  Computing  vendors,  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (S3)[4]  and 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)[4] are both well known examples. While these internet-based online services 
do  provide  huge  amounts  of  storage  space  and  customizable  computing  resources,  this  computing  platform  shift, 
however, is eliminating the responsibility of local machines for data maintenance at the same time. As a result, users 
are at the mercy of their cloud service providers for the availability and integrity of their data. Recent downtime of

Amazon’s S3[4] is such an example. Benefits of Cloud storage: No need to invest any capital on storage devices, No 
need  for  technical  expert  to  maintain  the  storage,  backup,  replication  and  importantly  disaster  management, 
Allowing others to access your data will result with collaborative working style instead of individual work.

Services in cloud computing 

A. SaaS: 

Software as a Service (SaaS)[8] are probably the most popular form of cloud computing and are easy to use. SaaS 
uses the Web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the 
clients’  side.  Most  SaaS  applications  can  be  run  directly  from  a  Web  browser,  without  any  downloads  or 
installations required. SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers. With SaaS, 
it’s  easy  for  enterprises  to  streamline  their  maintenance  and  support,  because  everything  can  be  managed  by 
vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Examples for 
SaaS are Gmail , Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365 , Google+ , face book , yahoo. 

B. PaaS: 

Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)[8]  deliver  computational  resources  through  a  platform.  What  developers  gain  with 
PaaS  is  a  framework  they  can  build  upon  to  develop  or  customize  applications.  PaaS  makes  the  development, 
testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective, eliminating the need to buy the underlying 
layers  of  hardware  and  software.  One  comparison  between  SaaS  vs.  PaaS  has  to  do  with  what  aspects  must  be 
managed by users, rather than providers: With PaaS, vendors still manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, 
servers,  storage,  and  networking,  but  users  manage  applications  and  data.  Examples  for  PaaS  are  AWS  Elastic 
Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com and Google App Engine. 

C. IaaS 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)[8] delivers computer infrastructure (such as a platform virtualization environment), 
storage, and networking. Instead of having to purchase software, servers, or network equipment, users can buy these 
as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

maximize  benefits  of  scale  and  to  pass  those  benefits  on  to  developers.  According  to  the  Spring  2010  Storage 
magazine/Search  Storage  Purchasing  Intentions  survey,  14%  of  respondents  said  they're  using  cloud  storage  now, 
with the largest numbers using cloud storage  for disaster recovery (6%). But 4% are using it to  hold primary data 
from their data centers, and an equal number are using it for near line data storage. But before you take plunge and 
sign up with a cloud storage service provider, there are some things you need to know. Is cloud storage secure? How 
much  will  it  cost?  What  services  are  best  for  SMBs?  In  our  cloud  storage  services  guide  for  beginners,  we've 
collected our top tips and expert advice in one place so you can get answers to your most important questions. Learn 
about cloud backup, cloud archiving, cloud disaster recovery, and using the cloud for primary storage.

Cloud Storage Models 

There  are  models  for  cloud  storage  that  allow  users  to  maintain  control  over  their  data.  Cloud  storage  [2]  has 
evolved  into  three  categories,  one  of  which  permits  the  merging  of  two  categories  for  a  cost-efficient  and  secure 
option. Public cloud storage providers, which present storage infrastructure as a leasable commodity (both in terms 
of long-term or short-term storage and the networking bandwidth used within the infrastructure). Private clouds use 
the concepts of public cloud storage but in a form that  can be securely embedded  within a user's firewall. Finally, 
hybrid cloud storage permits  the two  models to merge, allowing policies to define  which data must be maintained 
privately and which can be secured within public clouds (see Figure 6). 

 

Fig 1. Cloud storage models 

 

 

The cloud models are shown graphically in Figure 1. Examples of public cloud storage providers include Amazon 
(which  offers  storage  as  a  service).  Examples  of  private  cloud  storage  providers  include  IBM[1],  Para  scale,  and 
Clever  safe  (which  build  software  and/or  hardware  for  internal  clouds).  Finally,  hybrid  cloud  providers  include 
Egnyte, among others.

Data Storage Security techniques in cloud computing 

 
Various  existing  techniques  [2]  have  been  discussed  in  this  paper.  Cloud  storage  is  regarded  as  a  system  of 
disseminated data centers that generally Utilizes virtualization technology and supplies interface for data storage.

identify  based  encryption  (IBE)  and  decryption  and 

A. Implicit Storage Security to Data in Online  
 
Providing  implicit  storage  security  to  data  in  online  is  more  beneficial  in  a  cloud  computing.  The  use  of  a  data 
partitioning scheme for implementing such security involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. In this scheme 
data is partitioned in such way that each portion is implicitly secure and does not to be encrypted. These portions are 
stored  on  different  servers  on  the  network  which  are  known  only  to  the  user.  Reconstruction  of  the  data  requires 
access  to  each  server  and  the  knowledge  as  to  which  servers  the  data  portions  are  stored.  Several  versions  of  this 
scheme are described, which include the implicit storage of encryption keys rather than the data and where a subset 
of the partition may be brought together to recreate the data.  
 
B. Identify –Based Authentication  
 
An 
identity  based  signature  IBS  schemes  for 
IBHMCC.Resources and services are distributed across numerous consumer. So there is a chance of various security 
risks.  Therefore  authentication  of  users  as  well  as  services  is  an  important  requirement  for  cloud  security.  When 
SSH  Authentication  protocol  (SAP)  was  employed  to  cloud,  it  becomes  very  complex.  As  an  alternative  to  SAP, 
proposed a new authentication protocol based on identity which is based on hierarchical model with corresponding 
signature and encryption scheme. Identify based authentication protocol constrains sequence of steps. In step (1) the 
client C sends the servers a client Hello message. The message contains a fresh random number Cn.session identifier 
ID  and  c  specification.  In  step  (2)  the  server  S  responds  with  a  server  Hello  message  which  contains  new  fresh 
random number Sn.  
 
C. Public Auditing with Complete Data Dynamic Support  
 
Verification  of  data  integrity  at  unreliable  servers  is  the  major  concern  in  cloud  storage  with  public  audit  ability 
trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not posses can be delegated as an external audit party to  
access  the  risk  of  outsourced  data  when  needed.  It  also  provides  a  transparent  yet  cost  effective  method  for  data 
owners  to  gain  trust  in  the  cloud.  To  accomplish,  dynamic  data  support,  the  existent  proof  read  of  PDF  (or) POR 
scheme is improved by spoofing the basic Markel Hash tree (MHT).  
 
D. Efficient Third Party Auditing (TPA)  
 
Cloud consumers save data in cloud server so that security  as  well as data storage correctness is primary concern. 
The data owners having huge amount of outsourced data and auditing the data correctness in a cloud environment 
can be difficult and expensive for data owners. To support third party auditing where user safely delegate in integrity 
checking  tasks  to  third  party  auditors(TPA)[2]  this  scheme  can  almost  guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of 
data  error(i.e.  the  identification  of  misbehaving  servers).  A  novel  and  homogeneous  structure  is  introduced  to 
provide security to different cloud types. To achieve data storage security, BLS (Bonch-Lynn-Sachems) algorithm is 
used  to  signing  the  data  blocks  before  outsourcing  data  into  cloud.  Reed  Solomon  technique  is  used  for  error 
correction and to ensure data storage correction.  
 
E. Way of Dynamically Store Data in Cloud  
 
Data storage is cloud may not be completely trustable because the clients did not have local copy of data stored in 
cloud. To address these issues proposed a new protocol system using the data reading protocol algorithm to check 
the data integrity services providers help the clients to check the data security by the proposed effective automatic 
data  reading  algorithm.  A  flexible  distributed  storage  integrity  auditing  mechanism  (FDSIAM),  these  mechanisms 
utilizes the homomorphism tokens, blocking erasure and unblocking factors and distributed erasure coded data.  
 
F. Effective and Secure Storage Protocol  
 
Current trend is users outsourcing data into service provider who have enough area for storage  with lower storage 
cost.  A  secure  and  efficient  storage  protocol  is  proposed  that  guarantees  the  data  storage  confidentiality  and 
integrity.  This  protocol  is  invented  by  using  the  construction  of  elliptic  curve  cryptography  and  sober  sequence  is 
used to confirm the data integrity[2]. Data and software process protocol step executed by cloud customers to add 
the privacy enforcement structure to the software and data before transferring them to the cloud. Challenge response

protocol  is  protocol  is  credential  so  that  it  will  not  exposes  the  contents  of  the  data  to  outsiders.  Data  dynamic 
operations are also used keep the same security assurance and also provide relief to users from the difficult of data 
leakage and corruptions problems.  
 
G. Storage Security of Data  
 
The  data  is  secured  in  server  based  on  user’s  choice  of  security  method  so  that  data  is  given  high  secure  priority 
resources  are  being  shared  across  server  trouble  to  data  security  in  cloud.  Transmitting  data  over  internet  is 
dangerous  due  to  the  intruder  attacks  data  encryption  plays  an  important  role  in  cloud  environment.  Introduced  a 
consistent and novel  structure for providing security to cloud types and  implemented a secure cross platform. The 
proposed  effective  and  flexible  distribution  scheme  two-way  handshakes  based  on  token  management  by  utilizing 
the  homomorpic  token  with  distributed  verification  of  erasure  coded  data,  our  scheme  achieves  the  integration  of 
storage correctness insurance and data error location (i.e.) the identification of misbehaving server.  
 
H. Secure and Dependable Storage Service  
 
Storage service of permits consumers to the data in cloud as well as  allowed to utilize the available well qualified 
application  with no  worry data storage  maintained. Although cloud providers benefits, such a service gives  up  the 
self control of user’s data that introduced fresh valuability hazards to cloud data correctness. The proposed a flexible 
distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphism token and distributed coded-data. The 
proposed  design  further  support  secure  and  efficient  dynamic  operation  on  outsource  data  including  block 
modification, deletion and append.  
 
I. Optimal cloud storage systems 
 
Cloud  data  storage  which  requires  no  effort  is  acquiring  more  popularity  for  individual,  enteprise  and  institutions 
data  backup  and  synchrozation.  The  proposed  system  describes,  at  a  high  level,  a  possible  architecture  for  a 
cryptographic storage service. At its core, the architecture consists of these components- a data processor (DP) that 
processes data before it is sent to the cloud a data verifier (DV) that checks whether the data in the cloud has been 
tampers  with,  and  a  token  generator  (TG)[2]  that  generator  token  which  enables  the  cloud  storage  providers  to 
retrieve segments of consumer data.  
 
J. Process of access and store small files with storage  
 
To support services extensively, Hadoop distributed file system server reasons are examined for small file trouble of 
native  Hadoop  distributed  file  system.  Burden  on  Nane  Node  of  HADOOP  distributed  file  system  is  enforced  by 
large  amount  of  small  files,  for  data  placement  correction  are  not  considered  prefetching  mechanism  is  not  also 
presented.  In  order  to  overcome  these  small  size  problems,  proposed  an  approach  that  these  small  size  problem, 
proposed an approach. That improves the small file efficiency on Hadoop distributed file system, in a large cluster, 
thousands  of  servers  both  host  directly  attached  storage  and  execute  user  application  task.  By  distributing  storage 
and computation across many servers the resource a grow with demand while remaining economical at every size.  
 
K. File storage security management 
 
To  assure  the  security  of  stored  data  in  cloud,  presented  a  system  which  utilizes  distributed  scheme.  Proposed 
system consists of a master server and a set of slave server.  These are not direct commutation link between clients 
and  slave  servers  in  the  proposed  model.  Master  server  is  responsible  to  process  the  client’s  request  and  at  slave 
server  chunking  operation  in  order  to  provide  data  backup  for  file  recovery  in  future.  Clients  file  is  stored  in  the 
form of tokens on main server and files were chunked on slave server for file recovery.

Cloud Storage Architecture 

 
Cloud  storage  architectures  [3]  are  primarily  about  delivery  of  storage  on  demand  in  a  highly  scalable  and  multi-
tenant  way.  Generically  (see Figure  1),  cloud  storage  architectures  consist  of  a  front  end  that  exports  an  API  to 
access the storage. In traditional storage systems, this API is the SCSI protocol; but in the cloud, these protocols are

evolving.  There,  you  can  find  Web  service  front  ends,  file-based  front  ends,  and  even  more  traditional  front  ends 
(such as Internet SCSI, or iSCSI). Behind the  front end is a layer of  middleware that I  call the storage logic. This 
layer  implements  a  variety  of  features,  such  as  replication  and  data  reduction,  over  the  traditional  data-placement 
algorithms (with consideration for geographic placement). Finally, the back end implements the physical storage for 
data.  This  may  be  an  internal  protocol  that  implements  specific  features  or  a  traditional  back  end  to  the  physical 
disks. 

Fig 2. Cloud storage architecture 

 

 
From  Figure  2,  you  can  see  some  of  the  characteristics  for  current  cloud  storage  architectures[3].  Note  that  no 
characteristics  are  exclusive  in  the  particular  layer  but  serve  as  a  guide  for  specific  topics  that  addresses.  These 
characteristics are defined in table 1.

VI. 

Cloud Storage API (Application Programming Interface) 

 

A  Cloud  Storage  Application  Programming Interface (API)[7] is a  method for access to and utilization of a cloud 
storage  system.  The  most  common  of  these  kinds  are  REST  (Representational  State  Transfer)  although  there  are 
others, which are based on SOAP (Simple Object Access  Protocol). All these APIs are associated with establishing 
requests for service via the Internet. REST is a concept widely recognized as an approach to "quality" scalable API 
design. One of the most important features of REST is that it is a "stateless" architecture. This means that everything 
needed  to  complete  the  request  to  the  storage  cloud  is  contained  in  the  request,  so  that  a  session  between  the 
requestor and the  storage cloud is  not required. It is very important because the Internet is highly latent (it  has an 
unpredictable  response  time  and  it  is  generally  not  fast  when  compared  to  a  local  area  network).REST  is  an 
approach that has very high affinity to the way the Internet works. Traditional file storage access methods that use 
NFS (network  files  system) or CIFS (Common Internet  File System)[7] do not  work over the Internet, because of 
latency. Cloud Storage is for files, which, some refer to as objects, and others call unstructured data. Think about the 
files  stored  on  your  PC,  like  pictures,  spreadsheets  and  documents.  These  have  an  extraordinary  variability,  thus 
unstructured. The other kind of data is block or structured data. Think data base data, data that feeds transactional 
system  that  require  a  certain  guaranteed  or  low-latency  performance.  Cloud  Storage  is  not  for  this  use  case. 
Industrial  Design  Centre  (IDC)  estimates  that  approximately  70%  of  the  machine  stored  data  in  the  world  is 
unstructured,  and  this  is  also  the  fastest  growing  data  type.  So,  Cloud  Storage  is  storage  for  files  that  is  easily 
accessed via the Internet. This does not mean you cannot access Cloud Storage on a private network or LAN, which 
may also provide access to a storage cloud by other approaches, like NFS or CIFS. It does mean that the primary and 
preferred access is by a REST API. REST APIs are language neutral and therefore can be leveraged very easily by 
developers using any development language they choose. Resources  within the system  may be acted on through a 
URL. So, an  API is not a "programming language", but it is the  way a programming language is  used to access a 
storage cloud. REST APIs are also about changing the state of resource through representations of those resources. 
They are not about calling web service methods in a functional sense. The key differences between different Cloud 
Storage  APIs  are  the  URLs  defining  the  resources  and  the  format  of  the  representations.  Amazon  S3  APIs, 
Eucalyptus  APIs,  Rack  space  Cloud  Files  APIs,  Mezeo  APIs,  Nivanix  APIs,  Simple  Cloud  API,  along  with  the 
standards proposed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) Cloud Storage Technical Work Group, 
and more. 
 

VII. 

Conclusion 

 

Data  storage  in  cloud  is  more  advantageous  than  traditional  storage  because  of  its  availability,  scalability, 
performance,  portability  and  its  functional  requirements.  We  mainly  focused  on  data  storage  aspects  that  cloud 
service providers are following to store the data and security aspects to be provided for that data stored in cloud. We 
took a look on  Amazon  s3 [4] and third party  auditing (TPA)[2]  mechanisms  which are used for data storage and 
security for data in cloud.

Abstract:  cloud  computing  has  been  envisioned  as  the  next  generation  architecture  of  IT  enterprise.  Cloud 
computing moves the application software and data bases to the large data centers, where the management of the 
data  and  services  may  not  be  fully  trustworthy.  This  poses  many  new  security  challenges  which  have  not  been 
fully implemented. In this paper, we mainly focus on aspects for providing security for data storage in cloud, also 
architecture for data storage   that are implemented by other service providers vendors   in cloud, key points for 
proving security for data storage.

Introduction 

Several trends are opening up the era of Cloud  Computing [9], which is an Internet-based development and use of 
computer  technology.  The  ever  cheaper  and  more  powerful  processors,  together  with  the  software  as  a  service 
(SaaS)[8]  computing  architecture,  are  transforming  data  centers  into  pools  of  computing  service  on  a  huge  scale. 
The increasing network bandwidth and reliable yet flexible network connections make it even possible that users can 
now subscribe high quality services from data and software that reside solely on remote data centers. Moving data 
into  the  cloud  offers  great  convenience  to  users  since  they  don’t  have  to  care  about  the  complexities  of  direct 
hardware  management.  The  pioneer  of  Cloud  Computing  vendors,  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (S3)[4]  and 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)[4] are both well known examples. While these internet-based online services 
do  provide  huge  amounts  of  storage  space  and  customizable  computing  resources,  this  computing  platform  shift, 
however, is eliminating the responsibility of local machines for data maintenance at the same time. As a result, users 
are at the mercy of their cloud service providers for the availability and integrity of their data. Recent downtime of

Amazon’s S3[4] is such an example. Benefits of Cloud storage: No need to invest any capital on storage devices, No 
need  for  technical  expert  to  maintain  the  storage,  backup,  replication  and  importantly  disaster  management, 
Allowing others to access your data will result with collaborative working style instead of individual work.

Services in cloud computing 

A. SaaS: 

Software as a Service (SaaS)[8] are probably the most popular form of cloud computing and are easy to use. SaaS 
uses the Web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the 
clients’  side.  Most  SaaS  applications  can  be  run  directly  from  a  Web  browser,  without  any  downloads  or 
installations required. SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers. With SaaS, 
it’s  easy  for  enterprises  to  streamline  their  maintenance  and  support,  because  everything  can  be  managed  by 
vendors: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Examples for 
SaaS are Gmail , Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365 , Google+ , face book , yahoo. 

B. PaaS: 

Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)[8]  deliver  computational  resources  through  a  platform.  What  developers  gain  with 
PaaS  is  a  framework  they  can  build  upon  to  develop  or  customize  applications.  PaaS  makes  the  development, 
testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective, eliminating the need to buy the underlying 
layers  of  hardware  and  software.  One  comparison  between  SaaS  vs.  PaaS  has  to  do  with  what  aspects  must  be 
managed by users, rather than providers: With PaaS, vendors still manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, 
servers,  storage,  and  networking,  but  users  manage  applications  and  data.  Examples  for  PaaS  are  AWS  Elastic 
Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com and Google App Engine. 

C. IaaS 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)[8] delivers computer infrastructure (such as a platform virtualization environment), 
storage, and networking. Instead of having to purchase software, servers, or network equipment, users can buy these 
as  a  fully  outsourced  service  that  is  usually  billed  according  to  the  amount  of  resources  consumed.  Basically,  in 
exchange for a rental fee, a third party allows you to install a virtual server on their IT infrastructure. Compared to 
SaaS  ,  PaaS  and  IaaS  users  are  responsible  for  managing  more:  applications,  data,  runtime,  middleware,  and  O/S. 
Vendors  still  manage  virtualization,  servers,  hard  drives,  storage,  and  networking.  What  users  gain  with  IaaS  is 
infrastructure  on  top  of  which  they  can  install  any  required  platforms.  Users  are  responsible  for  updating  these  if 
new  versions  are  released.  Examples  for  IaaS  are  Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure,  Rack  space,  Google  Compute 
Engine 

D. StaaS (Storage as a Service) 

Commonly known as Storage as a Service (StaaS)[5] ,it facilitates cloud applications to scale beyond their  limited 
servers.  StaaS  allows  users  to  store  their  data  at  remote  disks  and  access  them  anytime  from  any  place.  Cloud 
storage  systems  are  expected  to  meet  several  rigorous  requirements  for  maintaining  users’  data  and  information, 
including high availability, reliability, performance, replication and data consistency; but because of the conflicting 
nature of these requirements, no one system implements all of them together. 

E. Amazon S3                                                                                                                           

Amazon S3[4] is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon 
S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from  anywhere  on  the  web.  It  gives  any  developer  access  to  the  same  highly  scalable,  reliable,  secure,  fast, 
inexpensive  infrastructure  that  Amazon  uses  to  run  its  own  global  network  of  websites.  The  service  aims  to

maximize  benefits  of  scale  and  to  pass  those  benefits  on  to  developers.  According  to  the  Spring  2010  Storage 
magazine/Search  Storage  Purchasing  Intentions  survey,  14%  of  respondents  said  they're  using  cloud  storage  now, 
with the largest numbers using cloud storage  for disaster recovery (6%). But 4% are using it to  hold primary data 
from their data centers, and an equal number are using it for near line data storage. But before you take plunge and 
sign up with a cloud storage service provider, there are some things you need to know. Is cloud storage secure? How 
much  will  it  cost?  What  services  are  best  for  SMBs?  In  our  cloud  storage  services  guide  for  beginners,  we've 
collected our top tips and expert advice in one place so you can get answers to your most important questions. Learn 
about cloud backup, cloud archiving, cloud disaster recovery, and using the cloud for primary storage.

Cloud Storage Models 

There  are  models  for  cloud  storage  that  allow  users  to  maintain  control  over  their  data.  Cloud  storage  [2]  has 
evolved  into  three  categories,  one  of  which  permits  the  merging  of  two  categories  for  a  cost-efficient  and  secure 
option. Public cloud storage providers, which present storage infrastructure as a leasable commodity (both in terms 
of long-term or short-term storage and the networking bandwidth used within the infrastructure). Private clouds use 
the concepts of public cloud storage but in a form that  can be securely embedded  within a user's firewall. Finally, 
hybrid cloud storage permits  the two  models to merge, allowing policies to define  which data must be maintained 
privately and which can be secured within public clouds (see Figure 6). 

 

Fig 1. Cloud storage models 

 

 

The cloud models are shown graphically in Figure 1. Examples of public cloud storage providers include Amazon 
(which  offers  storage  as  a  service).  Examples  of  private  cloud  storage  providers  include  IBM[1],  Para  scale,  and 
Clever  safe  (which  build  software  and/or  hardware  for  internal  clouds).  Finally,  hybrid  cloud  providers  include 
Egnyte, among others.

Data Storage Security techniques in cloud computing 

 
Various  existing  techniques  [2]  have  been  discussed  in  this  paper.  Cloud  storage  is  regarded  as  a  system  of 
disseminated data centers that generally Utilizes virtualization technology and supplies interface for data storage.

identify  based  encryption  (IBE)  and  decryption  and 

A. Implicit Storage Security to Data in Online  
 
Providing  implicit  storage  security  to  data  in  online  is  more  beneficial  in  a  cloud  computing.  The  use  of  a  data 
partitioning scheme for implementing such security involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. In this scheme 
data is partitioned in such way that each portion is implicitly secure and does not to be encrypted. These portions are 
stored  on  different  servers  on  the  network  which  are  known  only  to  the  user.  Reconstruction  of  the  data  requires 
access  to  each  server  and  the  knowledge  as  to  which  servers  the  data  portions  are  stored.  Several  versions  of  this 
scheme are described, which include the implicit storage of encryption keys rather than the data and where a subset 
of the partition may be brought together to recreate the data.  
 
B. Identify –Based Authentication  
 
An 
identity  based  signature  IBS  schemes  for 
IBHMCC.Resources and services are distributed across numerous consumer. So there is a chance of various security 
risks.  Therefore  authentication  of  users  as  well  as  services  is  an  important  requirement  for  cloud  security.  When 
SSH  Authentication  protocol  (SAP)  was  employed  to  cloud,  it  becomes  very  complex.  As  an  alternative  to  SAP, 
proposed a new authentication protocol based on identity which is based on hierarchical model with corresponding 
signature and encryption scheme. Identify based authentication protocol constrains sequence of steps. In step (1) the 
client C sends the servers a client Hello message. The message contains a fresh random number Cn.session identifier 
ID  and  c  specification.  In  step  (2)  the  server  S  responds  with  a  server  Hello  message  which  contains  new  fresh 
random number Sn.  
 
C. Public Auditing with Complete Data Dynamic Support  
 
Verification  of  data  integrity  at  unreliable  servers  is  the  major  concern  in  cloud  storage  with  public  audit  ability 
trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not posses can be delegated as an external audit party to  
access  the  risk  of  outsourced  data  when  needed.  It  also  provides  a  transparent  yet  cost  effective  method  for  data 
owners  to  gain  trust  in  the  cloud.  To  accomplish,  dynamic  data  support,  the  existent  proof  read  of  PDF  (or) POR 
scheme is improved by spoofing the basic Markel Hash tree (MHT).  
 
D. Efficient Third Party Auditing (TPA)  
 
Cloud consumers save data in cloud server so that security  as  well as data storage correctness is primary concern. 
The data owners having huge amount of outsourced data and auditing the data correctness in a cloud environment 
can be difficult and expensive for data owners. To support third party auditing where user safely delegate in integrity 
checking  tasks  to  third  party  auditors(TPA)[2]  this  scheme  can  almost  guarantee  the  simultaneous  localization  of 
data  error(i.e.  the  identification  of  misbehaving  servers).  A  novel  and  homogeneous  structure  is  introduced  to 
provide security to different cloud types. To achieve data storage security, BLS (Bonch-Lynn-Sachems) algorithm is 
used  to  signing  the  data  blocks  before  outsourcing  data  into  cloud.  Reed  Solomon  technique  is  used  for  error 
correction and to ensure data storage correction.  
 
E. Way of Dynamically Store Data in Cloud  
 
Data storage is cloud may not be completely trustable because the clients did not have local copy of data stored in 
cloud. To address these issues proposed a new protocol system using the data reading protocol algorithm to check 
the data integrity services providers help the clients to check the data security by the proposed effective automatic 
data  reading  algorithm.  A  flexible  distributed  storage  integrity  auditing  mechanism  (FDSIAM),  these  mechanisms 
utilizes the homomorphism tokens, blocking erasure and unblocking factors and distributed erasure coded data.  
 
F. Effective and Secure Storage Protocol  
 
Current trend is users outsourcing data into service provider who have enough area for storage  with lower storage 
cost.  A  secure  and  efficient  storage  protocol  is  proposed  that  guarantees  the  data  storage  confidentiality  and 
integrity.  This  protocol  is  invented  by  using  the  construction  of  elliptic  curve  cryptography  and  sober  sequence  is 
used to confirm the data integrity[2]. Data and software process protocol step executed by cloud customers to add 
the privacy enforcement structure to the software and data before transferring them to the cloud. Challenge response

protocol  is  protocol  is  credential  so  that  it  will  not  exposes  the  contents  of  the  data  to  outsiders.  Data  dynamic 
operations are also used keep the same security assurance and also provide relief to users from the difficult of data 
leakage and corruptions problems.  
 
G. Storage Security of Data  
 
The  data  is  secured  in  server  based  on  user’s  choice  of  security  method  so  that  data  is  given  high  secure  priority 
resources  are  being  shared  across  server  trouble  to  data  security  in  cloud.  Transmitting  data  over  internet  is 
dangerous  due  to  the  intruder  attacks  data  encryption  plays  an  important  role  in  cloud  environment.  Introduced  a 
consistent and novel  structure for providing security to cloud types and  implemented a secure cross platform. The 
proposed  effective  and  flexible  distribution  scheme  two-way  handshakes  based  on  token  management  by  utilizing 
the  homomorpic  token  with  distributed  verification  of  erasure  coded  data,  our  scheme  achieves  the  integration  of 
storage correctness insurance and data error location (i.e.) the identification of misbehaving server.  
 
H. Secure and Dependable Storage Service  
 
Storage service of permits consumers to the data in cloud as well as  allowed to utilize the available well qualified 
application  with no  worry data storage  maintained. Although cloud providers benefits, such a service gives  up  the 
self control of user’s data that introduced fresh valuability hazards to cloud data correctness. The proposed a flexible 
distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphism token and distributed coded-data. The 
proposed  design  further  support  secure  and  efficient  dynamic  operation  on  outsource  data  including  block 
modification, deletion and append.  
 
I. Optimal cloud storage systems 
 
Cloud  data  storage  which  requires  no  effort  is  acquiring  more  popularity  for  individual,  enteprise  and  institutions 
data  backup  and  synchrozation.  The  proposed  system  describes,  at  a  high  level,  a  possible  architecture  for  a 
cryptographic storage service. At its core, the architecture consists of these components- a data processor (DP) that 
processes data before it is sent to the cloud a data verifier (DV) that checks whether the data in the cloud has been 
tampers  with,  and  a  token  generator  (TG)[2]  that  generator  token  which  enables  the  cloud  storage  providers  to 
retrieve segments of consumer data.  
 
J. Process of access and store small files with storage  
 
To support services extensively, Hadoop distributed file system server reasons are examined for small file trouble of 
native  Hadoop  distributed  file  system.  Burden  on  Nane  Node  of  HADOOP  distributed  file  system  is  enforced  by 
large  amount  of  small  files,  for  data  placement  correction  are  not  considered  prefetching  mechanism  is  not  also 
presented.  In  order  to  overcome  these  small  size  problems,  proposed  an  approach  that  these  small  size  problem, 
proposed an approach. That improves the small file efficiency on Hadoop distributed file system, in a large cluster, 
thousands  of  servers  both  host  directly  attached  storage  and  execute  user  application  task.  By  distributing  storage 
and computation across many servers the resource a grow with demand while remaining economical at every size.  
 
K. File storage security management 
 
To  assure  the  security  of  stored  data  in  cloud,  presented  a  system  which  utilizes  distributed  scheme.  Proposed 
system consists of a master server and a set of slave server.  These are not direct commutation link between clients 
and  slave  servers  in  the  proposed  model.  Master  server  is  responsible  to  process  the  client’s  request  and  at  slave 
server  chunking  operation  in  order  to  provide  data  backup  for  file  recovery  in  future.  Clients  file  is  stored  in  the 
form of tokens on main server and files were chunked on slave server for file recovery.

Cloud Storage Architecture 

 
Cloud  storage  architectures  [3]  are  primarily  about  delivery  of  storage  on  demand  in  a  highly  scalable  and  multi-
tenant  way.  Generically  (see Figure  1),  cloud  storage  architectures  consist  of  a  front  end  that  exports  an  API  to 
access the storage. In traditional storage systems, this API is the SCSI protocol; but in the cloud, these protocols are

evolving.  There,  you  can  find  Web  service  front  ends,  file-based  front  ends,  and  even  more  traditional  front  ends 
(such as Internet SCSI, or iSCSI). Behind the  front end is a layer of  middleware that I  call the storage logic. This 
layer  implements  a  variety  of  features,  such  as  replication  and  data  reduction,  over  the  traditional  data-placement 
algorithms (with consideration for geographic placement). Finally, the back end implements the physical storage for 
data.  This  may  be  an  internal  protocol  that  implements  specific  features  or  a  traditional  back  end  to  the  physical 
disks.

From  Figure  2,  you  can  see  some  of  the  characteristics  for  current  cloud  storage  architectures[3].  Note  that  no 
characteristics  are  exclusive  in  the  particular  layer  but  serve  as  a  guide  for  specific  topics  that  addresses.  These 
characteristics are defined in table 1.

VI. 

Cloud Storage API (Application Programming Interface) 

 

A  Cloud  Storage  Application  Programming Interface (API)[7] is a  method for access to and utilization of a cloud 
storage  system.  The  most  common  of  these  kinds  are  REST  (Representational  State  Transfer)  although  there  are 
others, which are based on SOAP (Simple Object Access  Protocol). All these APIs are associated with establishing 
requests for service via the Internet. REST is a concept widely recognized as an approach to "quality" scalable API 
design. One of the most important features of REST is that it is a "stateless" architecture. This means that everything 
needed  to  complete  the  request  to  the  storage  cloud  is  contained  in  the  request,  so  that  a  session  between  the 
requestor and the  storage cloud is  not required. It is very important because the Internet is highly latent (it  has an 
unpredictable  response  time  and  it  is  generally  not  fast  when  compared  to  a  local  area  network).REST  is  an 
approach that has very high affinity to the way the Internet works. Traditional file storage access methods that use 
NFS (network  files  system) or CIFS (Common Internet  File System)[7] do not  work over the Internet, because of 
latency. Cloud Storage is for files, which, some refer to as objects, and others call unstructured data. Think about the 
files  stored  on  your  PC,  like  pictures,  spreadsheets  and  documents.  These  have  an  extraordinary  variability,  thus 
unstructured. The other kind of data is block or structured data. Think data base data, data that feeds transactional 
system  that  require  a  certain  guaranteed  or  low-latency  performance.  Cloud  Storage  is  not  for  this  use  case. 
Industrial  Design  Centre  (IDC)  estimates  that  approximately  70%  of  the  machine  stored  data  in  the  world  is 
unstructured,  and  this  is  also  the  fastest  growing  data  type.  So,  Cloud  Storage  is  storage  for  files  that  is  easily 
accessed via the Internet. This does not mean you cannot access Cloud Storage on a private network or LAN, which 
may also provide access to a storage cloud by other approaches, like NFS or CIFS. It does mean that the primary and 
preferred access is by a REST API. REST APIs are language neutral and therefore can be leveraged very easily by 
developers using any development language they choose. Resources  within the system  may be acted on through a 
URL. So, an  API is not a "programming language", but it is the  way a programming language is  used to access a 
storage cloud. REST APIs are also about changing the state of resource through representations of those resources. 
They are not about calling web service methods in a functional sense. The key differences between different Cloud 
Storage  APIs  are  the  URLs  defining  the  resources  and  the  format  of  the  representations.  Amazon  S3  APIs, 
Eucalyptus  APIs,  Rack  space  Cloud  Files  APIs,  Mezeo  APIs,  Nivanix  APIs,  Simple  Cloud  API,  along  with  the 
standards proposed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) Cloud Storage Technical Work Group, 
and more. 
 

VII. 

Conclusion 

 

Data  storage  in  cloud  is  more  advantageous  than  traditional  storage  because  of  its  availability,  scalability, 
performance,  portability  and  its  functional  requirements.  We  mainly  focused  on  data  storage  aspects  that  cloud 
service providers are following to store the data and security aspects to be provided for that data stored in cloud. We 
took a look on  Amazon  s3 [4] and third party  auditing (TPA)[2]  mechanisms  which are used for data storage and 
security for data in cloud.
