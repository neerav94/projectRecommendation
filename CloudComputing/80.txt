Service).  End  users  access  cloud-based applications through  a web  browser, thin  client or mobile  app while  the business 
software and  user's  data  are  stored  on  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Examples  include  Amazon  Web  Services  and  Google  App 
engine, which allocate space for a user to deploy and manage software "in the cloud". 

2. Deployment models:- 

Private cloud 

Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party and 

hosted internally or externally. Undertaking a private cloud project requires a significant level and degree of engagement to virtual 

the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. When done right, it can 

improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-
run  data  centers  are  generally  capital  intensive.  They  have  a  significant  physical  footprint,  requiring  allocations  of  space, 

hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital  expenditures. 

They have attracted criticism because users "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on 

management, essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept". 

Public cloud 

A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the  services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Technically there 

may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially 

different  for  services  (applications,  storage,  and  other  resources)  that  are  made  available  by  a  service  provider  for  a  public 

audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like Amazon 

AWS,  Microsoft  and  Google  own  and  operate  the  infrastructure  and  offer  access  only  via  Internet  (direct  connectivity  is  not 

offered). 

Community cloud 

Community  cloud shares  infrastructure  between  several  organizations  from  a  specific  community  with  common  concerns 

(security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally. The 

costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of 

cloud computing are realized. 

Hybrid cloud 

Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or  more clouds (private, community or public) that remain  distinct entities but are bound 

together,  offering  the  benefits  of  multiple  deployment  models.  Hybrid  cloud  can  also  mean  the  ability  to  connect  collocation, 

managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.

The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization generalizes the physical infrastructure, which 
is the most rigid component, and makes it available as a soft component that is easy to use and manage. By doing so, virtualization 
provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. On the other hand, 
autonomic  computing  automates  the  process  through  which  the  user  can  provision  resources on-demand.  By  minimizing  user 
involvement, automation speeds up the process and reduces the possibility of human errors 
Virtualization technology  allows  sharing  of  servers  and  storage  devices  and  increased  utilization.  Applications  can  be  easily 
migrated from one physical server to another. 
 
The  goal  of  scheduling  algorithms  in  distributed  systems  is  spreading  the  load  on  processors  and  maximizing  their  utilization 
while minimizing the total task execution time Job scheduling, one of the most famous optimization problems, plays a key role to 
improve  flexible  and  reliable  systems.  The  main  purpose  is  to  schedule  jobs  to  the  adaptable  resources  in  accordance  with 
adaptable time, which involves finding out a proper sequence in which jobs can be executed under transaction logic constraints. 
There are main two categories of scheduling algorithm. 
1)Static scheduling algorithm and  
2) Dynamic scheduling algorithm.  
Both have their own advantage and limitation. 
There has been various types of scheduling algorithm exist in distributed computing system. Most of them can be applied in the 
cloud environment with suitable verifications. The main advantage of job scheduling algorithm is to achieve a high performance 
computing and the best system throughput. Traditional job scheduling algorithms are not able to provide scheduling in the clo ud 
environments.  According  to  a  simple  classification,  job  scheduling  algorithms  in  cloud  computing  can  be  categorized  into  two 
main groups; Batch mode heuristic scheduling algorithms (BMHA) and online mode heuristic algorithms. 
 
3. Existing scheduling algorithm:- 
 
An Approach for Cloud Resource Scheduling Based on Parallel Genetic Algorithm 
Resource scheduling is a key process for clouds such as Infrastructure as a Service cloud. To make the most efficient use of the 
resources,  we  propose  an  optimized  scheduling  algorithm  to  achieve  the  optimization  or  sub-optimization  for  cloud  scheduling 
problems. Our scheduling policy achieved by Parallel Genetic Algorithm which is much faster than traditional Genetic Algorithm. 
Based on the research of using GA to deal with scheduling problem in the cloud, we propose PGA to achieve the optimization or 
sub-optimization for cloud scheduling problems.[16] 
 
A Novel Approach for Scheduling Service Request in 
Cloud with Trust Monitor 
Cloud computing serves as the service provider globally connected, which provides service to the cloud users. The processing of 
the  users  request  plays  an  important  role  in  the  cloud  service.  The  novel  cloud  scheduling  scheme  uses  SLA(Service  Level 
Agreement) along with trust monitor to provide a faster scheduling of the over flooding user request with secure processing of the 
request.  The  security  of  the  cloud  is  maintain  based  on  the  SLA  criteria  and  trust  monitor  acts  as  the  third  party  and  monitors 
whole processing of the services, any illegal action is consider as intrusion and reported to the scheduler and message is sent to the 
user and provider and further penalties is taken. The schedule gives improved fast schedule time and low rescheduling ratio than 
grid scheduling. The scheduling of large number of service request from the user to the cloud makes less response time from the 
cloud  provider.  The  proposed  scheduling  scheme  gives  improved  response  time  and  throughput.    The  unwanted  access  and 
security  of  service  are  obtained  the  cloud  provider.  The  cloud  user  gets  the  guaranteed  response  time  and  secured  service  and 
security for their data to be confidential.[17] 
 
Xu  Cheng  (2011)  has  defined  a  novel  scheduling  system  under  the  load  balancing  analysis  based  migration  approach.  Author 
defined  the  data  collection  process  on  YouTube.  Author  defined  partitioning  architecture  under  the  network  analysis  on  social 
relationship so that unbalanced partitioning over the system can be analyzed. Author defined the vital role in social relationship in 
the social media application. Author concludes that the user access pattern to the system can be taken into account so that social 
relationship  over  the  system  can  be  achieved  effectively.  Author  defined  a  similarity  and  dissimilarity  analysis  und  er  the 
preservation analysis approach[9]. 
 
J.Brandt (2010)  presented the  work on process replication and scheduling optimization  with process  migration in  virtual cloud 
environment  was presented in  wide area networks. Author defined a replication  approach to perform he cloud scheduling under 
the process replication and the virtual machine environment so that the system will propagate to the environment. Author defined 
an  additional  storage  based  system  so  that  effective  replication  to  the  system  will  be  done.  Author  explores  the  common  task 
defined on cloud environment. Author also discussed the integration issues in the replication and the migration process.[5]

Resource scheduling is a key process for clouds such as Infrastructure as a Service cloud. To make the most efficient use of the 
resources,  we  propose  an  optimized  scheduling  algorithm  to  achieve  the  optimization  or  sub-optimization  for  cloud  scheduling 
problems. Our scheduling policy achieved by Parallel Genetic Algorithm which is much faster than traditional Genetic Algorithm. 
Based on the research of using GA to deal with scheduling problem in the cloud, we propose PGA to achieve the optimization or 
sub-optimization for cloud scheduling problems.[16] 
 
A Novel Approach for Scheduling Service Request in 
Cloud with Trust Monitor 
Cloud computing serves as the service provider globally connected, which provides service to the cloud users. The processing of 
the  users  request  plays  an  important  role  in  the  cloud  service.  The  novel  cloud  scheduling  scheme  uses  SLA(Service  Level 
Agreement) along with trust monitor to provide a faster scheduling of the over flooding user request with secure processing of the 
request.  The  security  of  the  cloud  is  maintain  based  on  the  SLA  criteria  and  trust  monitor  acts  as  the  third  party  and  monitors 
whole processing of the services, any illegal action is consider as intrusion and reported to the scheduler and message is sent to the 
user and provider and further penalties is taken. The schedule gives improved fast schedule time and low rescheduling ratio than 
grid scheduling. The scheduling of large number of service request from the user to the cloud makes less response time from the 
cloud  provider.  The  proposed  scheduling  scheme  gives  improved  response  time  and  throughput.    The  unwanted  access  and 
security  of  service  are  obtained  the  cloud  provider.  The  cloud  user  gets  the  guaranteed  response  time  and  secured  service  and 
security for their data to be confidential.[17] 
 
Xu  Cheng  (2011)  has  defined  a  novel  scheduling  system  under  the  load  balancing  analysis  based  migration  approach.  Author 
defined  the  data  collection  process  on  YouTube.  Author  defined  partitioning  architecture  under  the  network  analysis  on  social 
relationship so that unbalanced partitioning over the system can be analyzed. Author defined the vital role in social relationship in 
the social media application. Author concludes that the user access pattern to the system can be taken into account so that social 
relationship  over  the  system  can  be  achieved  effectively.  Author  defined  a  similarity  and  dissimilarity  analysis  und  er  the 
preservation analysis approach[9]. 
 
J.Brandt (2010)  presented the  work on process replication and scheduling optimization  with process  migration in  virtual cloud 
environment  was presented in  wide area networks. Author defined a replication  approach to perform he cloud scheduling under 
the process replication and the virtual machine environment so that the system will propagate to the environment. Author defined 
an  additional  storage  based  system  so  that  effective  replication  to  the  system  will  be  done.  Author  explores  the  common  task 
defined on cloud environment. Author also discussed the integration issues in the replication and the migration process.[5]

CONCLUSION 
With the emerging of cloud computing, cloud workflow systems are designed to facilitate the cloud infrastructure to support large 
scale  distributed  collaborative  e-business  and  e-science  applications.  The  management  and  scheduling  of  resources  in  Cloud 
environment  is  complex,  and  therefore  demands  sophisticated  tools  for  analysis  the  algorithm  before  applying  them  to  the  real 
system. In this paper,  we have surveyed the  various existing  workflow  scheduling algorithms in cloud computing and tabulated

Abstract: 
Cloud  is  the  most  effective  technology  of  recent  times  at  attracts  most  users  and  organizations  towards  it.  Because  of  the 
different  opportunities  and  characteristics  provided  by  cloud  computing,  it  taken  the  attention  to  the  all  business  market 
stakeholders. The main problem in cloud computing is task scheduling. Scheduling is the most effective and important task for 
a computer system that basically decides the order of the process execution when different processes are kept in a queue. An 
effective scheduling give better resource utilization  and  that give better result to users.  The  need for a  scheduling algorithm 
arises  from  the  requirement  for  most  modern  systems  to  perform multitasking  and multiplexing.  In  this  paper  we  describe 
different scheduling algorithm. 
 
Keywords:  
Cloud computing, scheduling, algorithm 
 
1. Introduction:- 
 
A cloud environment is the vast network environment in which thousands of users are connected to avail the cloud services. There 
are  number  of  integrated  service  providers  that  satisfy  the  user  need  under  different  service  models.  The  models  offered  by  the 
cloud system include the Infrastructure-as-a service model, platform-as-a-service model and Software-as-a-service models. 
Services: 
The term "cloud computing" is mostly used to sell hosted services in the sense of application service provisioning that run client 
server software  at  a  remote  location.  Such  services  are  given  popular  acronyms  like  'SaaS'  (Software  as  a  Service),  'PaaS' 
(Platform  as  a  Service),  'IaaS'  (Infrastructure  as  a  Service),  'HaaS'  (Hardware  as  a  Service)  and  finally  'EaaS'  (Everything  as  a

Service).  End  users  access  cloud-based applications through  a web  browser, thin  client or mobile  app while  the business 
software and  user's  data  are  stored  on  servers  at  a  remote  location.  Examples  include  Amazon  Web  Services  and  Google  App 
engine, which allocate space for a user to deploy and manage software "in the cloud". 

2. Deployment models:- 

Private cloud 

Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party and 

hosted internally or externally. Undertaking a private cloud project requires a significant level and degree of engagement to virtual 

the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. When done right, it can 

improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-
run  data  centers  are  generally  capital  intensive.  They  have  a  significant  physical  footprint,  requiring  allocations  of  space, 

hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital  expenditures. 

They have attracted criticism because users "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on 

management, essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept". 

Public cloud 

A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the  services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Technically there 

may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially 

different  for  services  (applications,  storage,  and  other  resources)  that  are  made  available  by  a  service  provider  for  a  public 

audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like Amazon 

AWS,  Microsoft  and  Google  own  and  operate  the  infrastructure  and  offer  access  only  via  Internet  (direct  connectivity  is  not 

offered). 

Community cloud 

Community  cloud shares  infrastructure  between  several  organizations  from  a  specific  community  with  common  concerns 

(security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally. The 

costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of 

cloud computing are realized. 

Hybrid cloud 

Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or  more clouds (private, community or public) that remain  distinct entities but are bound 

together,  offering  the  benefits  of  multiple  deployment  models.  Hybrid  cloud  can  also  mean  the  ability  to  connect  collocation, 

managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.

The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization generalizes the physical infrastructure, which 
is the most rigid component, and makes it available as a soft component that is easy to use and manage. By doing so, virtualization 
provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. On the other hand, 
autonomic  computing  automates  the  process  through  which  the  user  can  provision  resources on-demand.  By  minimizing  user 
involvement, automation speeds up the process and reduces the possibility of human errors 
Virtualization technology  allows  sharing  of  servers  and  storage  devices  and  increased  utilization.  Applications  can  be  easily 
migrated from one physical server to another. 
 
The  goal  of  scheduling  algorithms  in  distributed  systems  is  spreading  the  load  on  processors  and  maximizing  their  utilization 
while minimizing the total task execution time Job scheduling, one of the most famous optimization problems, plays a key role to 
improve  flexible  and  reliable  systems.  The  main  purpose  is  to  schedule  jobs  to  the  adaptable  resources  in  accordance  with 
adaptable time, which involves finding out a proper sequence in which jobs can be executed under transaction logic constraints. 
There are main two categories of scheduling algorithm. 
1)Static scheduling algorithm and  
2) Dynamic scheduling algorithm.  
Both have their own advantage and limitation. 
There has been various types of scheduling algorithm exist in distributed computing system. Most of them can be applied in the 
cloud environment with suitable verifications. The main advantage of job scheduling algorithm is to achieve a high performance 
computing and the best system throughput. Traditional job scheduling algorithms are not able to provide scheduling in the clo ud 
environments.  According  to  a  simple  classification,  job  scheduling  algorithms  in  cloud  computing  can  be  categorized  into  two 
main groups; Batch mode heuristic scheduling algorithms (BMHA) and online mode heuristic algorithms.
