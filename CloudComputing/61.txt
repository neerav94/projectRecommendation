I. INTRODUCTION 

  
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model 
in  which  applications  are  hosted  by  a  vendor  or  service 
provider  and  made  available  to  customers  over  a  network, 
typically  the  Internet    SaaS  is  becoming  an    increasingly 
prevalent  delivery  model  as  underlying  technologies  that 
support  Web  services  and  service-oriented  architecture 
(SOA)  mature  and    new  developmental  approaches,  such  as 
Ajax,  become  popular.  Meanwhile,  broadband  service  has 
become  increasingly  available  to  support  user  access  from 
more  areas  around  the  world.  SaaS  is  closely  related  to  the 
ASP 
(application  service  provider)  and  on  demand 
computing  software  delivery  models.  IDC    identifies  two 
slightly  different  delivery  models  for  SaaS.  This  technology 
allows  for  much  more  efficient  computing  by  centralizing 
storage, memory, processing and bandwidth[2].

III.  CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY ISSUES 

their 

  
In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being 
a  promising  business  concept  to  one  of  the  fastest  growing 
segments  of  the  IT  industry.  Now,  recession-hit  companies 
are  increasingly  realizing  that  simply  by  tapping  into  the 
cloud  they  can  gain  fast  access  to  best-of-breed  business 
applications  or  drastically  boost 
infrastructure 
resources,  all  at  negligible  cost.  But  as  more  and  more 
information  on  individuals  and  companies  is  placed  in  the 
cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an 
environment it is[1]. 
  
A.  Identity management in the cloud is immature  
Cloud providers themselves aren't always sophisticated about 
integrating  their  platforms  with  identity  services  that  exist 
behind the enterprise firewall, says Forrester analyst Chenxi 
Wang.  There  are  some  third-party  technologies  that  let  IT 
extend  role-based  access  controls  into  the  cloud  with  single 
sign-on, from Ping Identity and Symplified, Wang says. But 
overall, "this is a field that is still in the early stage,"  
We know   that   Google  has a "Secure Data  Connector" that 
forms  an  encrypted  connection  between  a  customer's  data 
and  Google's  business  applications,  while 
the 
customer control which employees may access Google Apps 
resources. Salesforce provides a similar tool[2]. 
 
 B.  Cloud standards are weak 
We  know  that    any  cloud  vendor  touting  its  security 
credentials. SAS 70 is an auditing standard designed to show 

letting 

that  service  providers  have  sufficient  control  over  data.  The 
standard  wasn’t  crafted  with  cloud  computing  in  mind,  but 
it’s  become  stand-in  benchmark  in  the  absence  of  cloud-
specific standards. On the other hand, users may leak hidden 
information  when  they  accessing  cloud  computing  services. 
There's no guarantee that your data will be safe with an ISO 
27001-compliant  vendor,  however.  One  survey  of  IT 
managers  commissioned  by  CA  found  numerous  companies 
that claim to be compliant with ISO 27001 yet "admit to bad 
practices  with  regard  to  privileged  user  management," 
including  sharing  of  administrator  accounts  between  users 
and granting broader privileges to users than is necessary[2]. 
 
C. Secrecy 
Cloud  vendors  argue  that  they  are  more  able  to  secure  data 
than  a  typical  customer,  and  that  SaaS  security  is  actually 
better  than  most  people  think.  But  some  customers  find  this 
hard  to  believe  because  SaaS  vendors  tend  to  be  rather 
secretive  about  their  security  processes.In  particular,  many 
cloud  service  providers  release  very  few  details  about  their 
data  centers  and  operations,  claiming  it  would  compromise 
security.  However  customers  and  industry  analysts  are 
getting  fed  up  with  all  the  unanswered  questions  and  hush-
hush nondisclosure agreements.  
 

IV. CLOUD COMPUTNG MODELS 

 
A. Public Cloud  
A public cloud is one based on the standard cloud computing 
model, in which a service provider makes resources, such as 
applications and storage, available to the general public over 
the Internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on 
a pay-per-usage model[1].  
The main benefits of using a public cloud service are:  
1.  Easy  and 
set-up  because  hardware, 
application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.  
Scalability to meet needs.  
2. No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.

computing  have  allowed  corporate  network  and  datacenter 
administrators  to  effectively  become  service  providers  that 
meet  the  needs  of  their  "customers"  within  the  corporation. 
Marketing  media  that  uses  the  words  "private  cloud"  is 
designed  to  appeal  to  an  organization  that  needs  or  wants 
more  control  over  their  data  than  they  can  get  by  using  a 
third-party hosted service such as Amazon's Elastic Compute 
Cloud (EC2) or Simple Storage Service (S3)[4].  
 
C. Hybrid Cloud  
A hybrid cloud is a Cloud Computing environment in which 
an  organization  provides  and  manages  some  resources  in-
house  and  has  others  provided  externally.  For  example,  an 
organization  might  use  a  public  cloud  service,  such  as 
Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)  for  archived 
data but continue to maintain in-house storage for operational 
customer data. Ideally, the hybrid approach allows a business 
to  take  advantage  of  the  scalability  and  cost-effectiveness 
that  a  public  cloud  computing  environment  offers  without 
exposing mission-critical applications and data to third-party 
vulnerabilities[4].  
 
D. Private Cloud  
A  community  cloud  may  be  established  where  several 
organizations  have  similar  requirements  and  seek  to  share 
infrastructure  so  as  to  realize  some  of  the  benefits  of  cloud 
computing.  With  the  costs  spread  over  fewer  users  than  a 
public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  single  tenant)  this  option  is 
more  expensive  but  may  offer  a  higher  level  of  privacy, 
security  and/or  policy  compliance.  Examples  of  community 
cloud include Google's "Gov Cloud"[5]. 
 
V. ALL CLOUD MODELS ARE NOT THE SAME

Although  the  term  Cloud  Computing  is  widely  used,  it  is 
important to note that all Cloud Models are not the same. As 
such, it is critical that organizations don't apply a broad brush 
one-size fits all approach to security across all models. Cloud 
Models can be segmented into Software as a Service (Saas), 
Platform  as  a  service  (PaaS)  and  Integration  as  a  Service 
(IaaS). When  an  organization is considering Cloud Security 

it  should  consider  both  the  differences  and  similarities 
between these three segments of Cloud Models.

SaaS  delivery  model  consists  of  several  components  that 
have  been  developed  through  past  years,  nevertheless, 
employing  those  components  together  in  a  shared  and 
outsourced environment carries multiple challenges. Security 
and  Privacy  are  the  most  significant  challenges  that  may 
impede  the  Cloud  Computing  adoption.  Breaching  the 
security  of  any  component  impact  the  other  components’ 
security, consequently, the security of the entire system  will 
collapse.  In  this  section  we  study  the  security  issue  of  each 
component  and  discuss 
the  proposed  solutions  and 
recommendations.  
 
A. Service Level Agreement (SLA)  
Cloud  Computing  emerges  a  set  of    IT  management 
complexities,  and  using  SLA    in  cloud  is  the  solution  to 
guarantee  acceptable  level  of  QoS.  SLA  encompasses  SLA 
contract  definition,  SLA  negotiation,  SLA  monitoring,  and 
SLA  enforcement.  SLA  contract  definition  and  negotiation 
stage 
the  benefits  and 
responsibilities  of  each    party,  any  misunderstanding  will 
affect  the  systems  security  and  leave  the  client  exposure  to 
vulnerabilities. On the other hand, monitoring and enforcing 
SLA stage is crucial to build the trust between  the provider 
and  the  client.  To  enforce  SLA  in  a  dynamic  environment 
such  Cloud,  it  is  necessary  to  monitor    QoS  attributes 
continuously.  Web  Service  Level  Agreement  (WSLA) 
framework  developed  for  SLA  monitoring  and  enforcement 
in  SOA.  Using  WSLA  for  managing  SLA  in  Cloud 
Computing environment was proposed in by delegating SLA 
monitoring  and  enforcement  tasks  to  a  third  party  to  solve 
the  trust  problem.  Currently,  cloud  clients  have  to  trust 
providers’  SLA  monitoring  until  standardizing  Cloud 
Computing  systems  and  delegating  third-parties  to  mediate 
SLA monitoring and enforcement.  
 
B. Utility Computing  
Utility  computing  refers  to  the  ability  to  meter  the  offered  
services  and  charge  customers  for  exact  usage.  It  is 
interesting to note that the term originates from public utility 
services such as electricity.

explained 
infrastructure,  Utility 
computing  is  a  good  choice  for  less  resource  demanding 
applications where peak usage is expected to be sporadic and 
rare. 
 
Still,  Utility  computing  does  not  require  Cloud  computing 
and  it  can  be  done  in  any  server  environment.  Also,  it  is 
unreasonable  to  meter  smaller  usage  and  economically

Abstract- Cloud computing is current buzzword in the market. It is standard in which the assets can be leveraged on per use basis 
thus reducing the cost and complexity of service providers. Cloud computing promises to cut operational and capital costs and 
more  importantly  let  IT  departments  focus  on  strategic  projects  instead  of  keeping  datacenters  running.  It  is  much  more  than 
simple  internet.  It  is  a  construct  that  allows  user  to  access  applications  that  actually  reside  at  location  other  than  user’s  own 
computer or other Internet-connected devices. There are numerous benefits of this construct. For instance other company hosts 
user application[1]. This implies that they handle cost of servers, they manage software updates and depending on the contract 
user pays less i.e. for the service only. Confidentiality, Integrity,  Availability,  Authenticity, and Privacy are essential  concerns 
for  both  Cloud  providers  and  consumers  as  well.  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS)  serves  as  the  foundation  layer  for  the  other 
delivery models, and a lack of security in this layer will certainly affect the other delivery models, i.e., PaaS, and SaaS that are 
built upon IaaS layer. This paper presents an elaborated study of SaaS components’ security and determines vulnerabilities and 
countermeasures. Service Level Agreement should be Considered very much importance [1].

I. INTRODUCTION 

  
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model 
in  which  applications  are  hosted  by  a  vendor  or  service 
provider  and  made  available  to  customers  over  a  network, 
typically  the  Internet    SaaS  is  becoming  an    increasingly 
prevalent  delivery  model  as  underlying  technologies  that 
support  Web  services  and  service-oriented  architecture 
(SOA)  mature  and    new  developmental  approaches,  such  as 
Ajax,  become  popular.  Meanwhile,  broadband  service  has 
become  increasingly  available  to  support  user  access  from 
more  areas  around  the  world.  SaaS  is  closely  related  to  the 
ASP 
(application  service  provider)  and  on  demand 
computing  software  delivery  models.  IDC    identifies  two 
slightly  different  delivery  models  for  SaaS.  This  technology 
allows  for  much  more  efficient  computing  by  centralizing 
storage, memory, processing and bandwidth[2]. 
 

II. CLOUD COMPUTNG SERVICES 

 
A. Infrastructure-as-a-Service  

The Infrastructure as a Service is a provision  model in which 
an organization  outsourcers the equipment  used   to support 
operations, 
including  storage,  hardware,  servers  and  
networking  components.  The    service  provider  owns  the 
equipment  and    is  responsible  for  housing,  running  and 
maintaining it through as Hardware as a Service (HaaS)[3].  
 
B. Plateform-As-A-Service  
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)  is  a  way  to  rent  hardware, 
operating  systems,  storage  and  network  capacity  over  the  
Internet.  The  service  delivery  model  allows  the  customer  to 
rent  virtualized  servers  and  associated  services  for  running 
existing  applications  or  developing  and  testing  new  ones. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is an outgrowth of Software as a 
Service  (SaaS),  a  software  distribution  model  in  which 
hosted software applications are made available to customers 
over the Internet.

network  or  personal  computer.  With  SaaS,  a  provider 
licenses  an  application  to  customers  either  as  a  service  on 
demand, through a subscription, in a "pay-as-you-go" model, 
or at no charge. This approach to application delivery is part 
of the utility computing model where all of the technology is 
in  the  "cloud"  accessed  over  the  Internet  as  a  service.  SaaS 
was initially widely deployed for sales force automation and 
Customer  Relationship  Management  (CRM).  Now  it  has 
become  commonplace  for  many  business  tasks,  including 
computerized 
resource 
management, financials, content  management, collaboration, 
document management, and service desk management.

III.  CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY ISSUES 

their 

  
In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being 
a  promising  business  concept  to  one  of  the  fastest  growing 
segments  of  the  IT  industry.  Now,  recession-hit  companies 
are  increasingly  realizing  that  simply  by  tapping  into  the 
cloud  they  can  gain  fast  access  to  best-of-breed  business 
applications  or  drastically  boost 
infrastructure 
resources,  all  at  negligible  cost.  But  as  more  and  more 
information  on  individuals  and  companies  is  placed  in  the 
cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an 
environment it is[1]. 
  
A.  Identity management in the cloud is immature  
Cloud providers themselves aren't always sophisticated about 
integrating  their  platforms  with  identity  services  that  exist 
behind the enterprise firewall, says Forrester analyst Chenxi 
Wang.  There  are  some  third-party  technologies  that  let  IT 
extend  role-based  access  controls  into  the  cloud  with  single 
sign-on, from Ping Identity and Symplified, Wang says. But 
overall, "this is a field that is still in the early stage,"  
We know   that   Google  has a "Secure Data  Connector" that 
forms  an  encrypted  connection  between  a  customer's  data 
and  Google's  business  applications,  while 
the 
customer control which employees may access Google Apps 
resources. Salesforce provides a similar tool[2]. 
 
 B.  Cloud standards are weak 
We  know  that    any  cloud  vendor  touting  its  security 
credentials. SAS 70 is an auditing standard designed to show 

letting 

that  service  providers  have  sufficient  control  over  data.  The 
standard  wasn’t  crafted  with  cloud  computing  in  mind,  but 
it’s  become  stand-in  benchmark  in  the  absence  of  cloud-
specific standards. On the other hand, users may leak hidden 
information  when  they  accessing  cloud  computing  services. 
There's no guarantee that your data will be safe with an ISO 
27001-compliant  vendor,  however.  One  survey  of  IT 
managers  commissioned  by  CA  found  numerous  companies 
that claim to be compliant with ISO 27001 yet "admit to bad 
practices  with  regard  to  privileged  user  management," 
including  sharing  of  administrator  accounts  between  users 
and granting broader privileges to users than is necessary[2]. 
 
C. Secrecy 
Cloud  vendors  argue  that  they  are  more  able  to  secure  data 
than  a  typical  customer,  and  that  SaaS  security  is  actually 
better  than  most  people  think.  But  some  customers  find  this 
hard  to  believe  because  SaaS  vendors  tend  to  be  rather 
secretive  about  their  security  processes.In  particular,  many 
cloud  service  providers  release  very  few  details  about  their 
data  centers  and  operations,  claiming  it  would  compromise 
security.  However  customers  and  industry  analysts  are 
getting  fed  up  with  all  the  unanswered  questions  and  hush-
hush nondisclosure agreements.  
 

IV. CLOUD COMPUTNG MODELS 

 
A. Public Cloud  
A public cloud is one based on the standard cloud computing 
model, in which a service provider makes resources, such as 
applications and storage, available to the general public over 
the Internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on 
a pay-per-usage model[1].  
The main benefits of using a public cloud service are:  
1.  Easy  and 
set-up  because  hardware, 
application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.  
Scalability to meet needs.  
2. No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.  
 

inexpensive

keep the system healthy and well functioning, but the client’s 
practice also affects the system.  
C. Cloud Software  
The  one  caveat  for  its  findings,  is  that  although  the  survey 
had  785  executive  level  respondents,  65%  of  these  were 
providers,  35%  were  customers,  and  their  responses  were 
combined  in  the  data.    It  would  have  been  nice  if  all  of  the 
results were available separately for each of these groups, but 
having  been  both  a  customer  and  a  provider,  I  know  that 
providers often have much better visibility into the aggregate 
situation  for  a  market.    Hence,  the  providers’  perspectives 
into such findings as the key drivers, inhibitors and trends for 
Cloud  Computing  adoption,  actually  represent  experiences 
across  their  entire  customer  base.    Additionally,  even  with 
the  mixed  respondents,  the  sheer  magnitude  of  some  of  the 
data  points,  as  well  as  their  percent  year-over-year  change, 
serve  as  another  proof  point  of  the  rapid  escalation  of 
adoption and market perceptions around Cloud.  

As a result of this research, we also discuss a Security Model 
for  SaaS  (SMI)    as  a  guide  for  assessing  and  enhancing 
security  in  each  layer  of  SaaS  delivery  model  as  shown 
below. SMI  model consists of three sides: IaaS components, 
security model, and the restriction level. The security model 
side includes three  vertical entities  where each entity covers 
the  entire  IaaS  components.  The  first  entity  is  Secure 
Configuration  Policy 
secure 
configuration  for  each  layer  in  IaaS  Hardware,  Software,  or 
SLA  configurations;  usually,  miss-configuration  incidents 
could 
the  system. 
Nevertheless,  we  hope  SMI  model  be  a  good  start  for  the 
standardization  of  IaaS  layers.  This  model  indicates  the 
relation between IaaS components and security requirements, 
and  eases  security  improvement  in  individual  layers  to 
achieve a total secure IaaS system[16].

D. Platform Virtualization  
Virtualization, a fundamental technology platform for Cloud 
Computing  services,  facilitates  aggregation  of  multiple 
standalone  systems  into  a  single  hardware  platform  by 
virtualizing  the  computing  resources  (e.g.,  network,  CPUs, 
memory,  and  storage).  Hardware  abstraction  hides  the 
complexity  of  managing  the  physical  computing  platform 
and  simplifies  the  computing  resources  scalability.  Hence, 
virtualization  provides  multi  tenancy  and  scalability,  and 
these are two significant characteristics of Cloud Computing 
As  the  hypervisor  is  responsible  for  VMs  isolation,  VMs 
could  not  be  able  to  directly  access  others’  virtual  disks, 
memory,  or  applications  on  the  same  host.  IaaS,  a  shared 
environment, demands an accurate configuration to maintain 
strong 
isolation.  Cloud  service  providers  undertake  a 
substantial effort to secure their systems in order to minimize 
the  threats  that  result  from  communication,  monitoring, 
modification,  migration,  mobility,  and  DoS.  In  this  section, 
we  discuss  virtualization  risks  and  vulnerabilities  that  affect 
particularly  IaaS  delivery  model  in  addition  to  the  recent 
proposed  solutions  to  guarantee  security,  privacy,  and  data 
integrity for IaaS[17].

describe a single thing – rather it is a universal term that sits 
over a variety of services from  Software as a  Service at the 
base,  through  Platform  as  a  Service  as  a  development    tool 
and    through    to  infrastructure  as  a  Service  replacing  on-
premise  applications..    In  this  paper  an  overview  of  cloud 
computing  service  delivery  model,  SaaS  along  with  the 
security challenges , including both the traditional and cloud 
specific  security  challenges  ,associated  with  the  model  has  
been  presented  A  number  of  new  challenges  that  is 
inherently  connected  to  the  new  cloud  paradigm    has  also 
been    deliberated  in  the  paper.  As  secure  data  storage  in 
cloud  environment  is  a  significant  concern  which    prevents 
many  users  from    using  the  cloud,  a  practical  solution  to 
provide security and privacy for user data, when it is located 
in a public cloud, was also discussed in this paper. The  need  
for  further  work  on  various  security  mechanisms  has  also

Abstract- Cloud computing is current buzzword in the market. It is standard in which the assets can be leveraged on per use basis 
thus reducing the cost and complexity of service providers. Cloud computing promises to cut operational and capital costs and 
more  importantly  let  IT  departments  focus  on  strategic  projects  instead  of  keeping  datacenters  running.  It  is  much  more  than 
simple  internet.  It  is  a  construct  that  allows  user  to  access  applications  that  actually  reside  at  location  other  than  user’s  own 
computer or other Internet-connected devices. There are numerous benefits of this construct. For instance other company hosts 
user application[1]. This implies that they handle cost of servers, they manage software updates and depending on the contract 
user pays less i.e. for the service only. Confidentiality, Integrity,  Availability,  Authenticity, and Privacy are essential  concerns 
for  both  Cloud  providers  and  consumers  as  well.  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS)  serves  as  the  foundation  layer  for  the  other 
delivery models, and a lack of security in this layer will certainly affect the other delivery models, i.e., PaaS, and SaaS that are 
built upon IaaS layer. This paper presents an elaborated study of SaaS components’ security and determines vulnerabilities and 
countermeasures. Service Level Agreement should be Considered very much importance [1].

I. INTRODUCTION 

  
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model 
in  which  applications  are  hosted  by  a  vendor  or  service 
provider  and  made  available  to  customers  over  a  network, 
typically  the  Internet    SaaS  is  becoming  an    increasingly 
prevalent  delivery  model  as  underlying  technologies  that 
support  Web  services  and  service-oriented  architecture 
(SOA)  mature  and    new  developmental  approaches,  such  as 
Ajax,  become  popular.  Meanwhile,  broadband  service  has 
become  increasingly  available  to  support  user  access  from 
more  areas  around  the  world.  SaaS  is  closely  related  to  the 
ASP 
(application  service  provider)  and  on  demand 
computing  software  delivery  models.  IDC    identifies  two 
slightly  different  delivery  models  for  SaaS.  This  technology 
allows  for  much  more  efficient  computing  by  centralizing 
storage, memory, processing and bandwidth[2]. 
 

II. CLOUD COMPUTNG SERVICES 

 
A. Infrastructure-as-a-Service  

The Infrastructure as a Service is a provision  model in which 
an organization  outsourcers the equipment  used   to support 
operations, 
including  storage,  hardware,  servers  and  
networking  components.  The    service  provider  owns  the 
equipment  and    is  responsible  for  housing,  running  and 
maintaining it through as Hardware as a Service (HaaS)[3].  
 
B. Plateform-As-A-Service  
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS)  is  a  way  to  rent  hardware, 
operating  systems,  storage  and  network  capacity  over  the  
Internet.  The  service  delivery  model  allows  the  customer  to 
rent  virtualized  servers  and  associated  services  for  running 
existing  applications  or  developing  and  testing  new  ones. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is an outgrowth of Software as a 
Service  (SaaS),  a  software  distribution  model  in  which 
hosted software applications are made available to customers 
over the Internet.

network  or  personal  computer.  With  SaaS,  a  provider 
licenses  an  application  to  customers  either  as  a  service  on 
demand, through a subscription, in a "pay-as-you-go" model, 
or at no charge. This approach to application delivery is part 
of the utility computing model where all of the technology is 
in  the  "cloud"  accessed  over  the  Internet  as  a  service.  SaaS 
was initially widely deployed for sales force automation and 
Customer  Relationship  Management  (CRM).  Now  it  has 
become  commonplace  for  many  business  tasks,  including 
computerized 
resource 
management, financials, content  management, collaboration, 
document management, and service desk management.

III.  CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY ISSUES 

their 

  
In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being 
a  promising  business  concept  to  one  of  the  fastest  growing 
segments  of  the  IT  industry.  Now,  recession-hit  companies 
are  increasingly  realizing  that  simply  by  tapping  into  the 
cloud  they  can  gain  fast  access  to  best-of-breed  business 
applications  or  drastically  boost 
infrastructure 
resources,  all  at  negligible  cost.  But  as  more  and  more 
information  on  individuals  and  companies  is  placed  in  the 
cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an 
environment it is[1]. 
  
A.  Identity management in the cloud is immature  
Cloud providers themselves aren't always sophisticated about 
integrating  their  platforms  with  identity  services  that  exist 
behind the enterprise firewall, says Forrester analyst Chenxi 
Wang.  There  are  some  third-party  technologies  that  let  IT 
extend  role-based  access  controls  into  the  cloud  with  single 
sign-on, from Ping Identity and Symplified, Wang says. But 
overall, "this is a field that is still in the early stage,"  
We know   that   Google  has a "Secure Data  Connector" that 
forms  an  encrypted  connection  between  a  customer's  data 
and  Google's  business  applications,  while 
the 
customer control which employees may access Google Apps 
resources. Salesforce provides a similar tool[2]. 
 
 B.  Cloud standards are weak 
We  know  that    any  cloud  vendor  touting  its  security 
credentials. SAS 70 is an auditing standard designed to show 

letting 

that  service  providers  have  sufficient  control  over  data.  The 
standard  wasn’t  crafted  with  cloud  computing  in  mind,  but 
it’s  become  stand-in  benchmark  in  the  absence  of  cloud-
specific standards. On the other hand, users may leak hidden 
information  when  they  accessing  cloud  computing  services. 
There's no guarantee that your data will be safe with an ISO 
27001-compliant  vendor,  however.  One  survey  of  IT 
managers  commissioned  by  CA  found  numerous  companies 
that claim to be compliant with ISO 27001 yet "admit to bad 
practices  with  regard  to  privileged  user  management," 
including  sharing  of  administrator  accounts  between  users 
and granting broader privileges to users than is necessary[2]. 
 
C. Secrecy 
Cloud  vendors  argue  that  they  are  more  able  to  secure  data 
than  a  typical  customer,  and  that  SaaS  security  is  actually 
better  than  most  people  think.  But  some  customers  find  this 
hard  to  believe  because  SaaS  vendors  tend  to  be  rather 
secretive  about  their  security  processes.In  particular,  many 
cloud  service  providers  release  very  few  details  about  their 
data  centers  and  operations,  claiming  it  would  compromise 
security.  However  customers  and  industry  analysts  are 
getting  fed  up  with  all  the  unanswered  questions  and  hush-
hush nondisclosure agreements.  
 

IV. CLOUD COMPUTNG MODELS 

 
A. Public Cloud  
A public cloud is one based on the standard cloud computing 
model, in which a service provider makes resources, such as 
applications and storage, available to the general public over 
the Internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on 
a pay-per-usage model[1].  
The main benefits of using a public cloud service are:  
1.  Easy  and 
set-up  because  hardware, 
application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.  
Scalability to meet needs.  
2. No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.  
 

inexpensive

B. Community Cloud  
Private  cloud  (also  called  internal  cloud  or  corporate  cloud) 
is a marketing term for a proprietary computing architecture 
that  provides  hosted  services  to  a  limited  number  of  people 
behind a  firewall.  Advances in virtualization and distributed

computing  have  allowed  corporate  network  and  datacenter 
administrators  to  effectively  become  service  providers  that 
meet  the  needs  of  their  "customers"  within  the  corporation. 
Marketing  media  that  uses  the  words  "private  cloud"  is 
designed  to  appeal  to  an  organization  that  needs  or  wants 
more  control  over  their  data  than  they  can  get  by  using  a 
third-party hosted service such as Amazon's Elastic Compute 
Cloud (EC2) or Simple Storage Service (S3)[4].  
 
C. Hybrid Cloud  
A hybrid cloud is a Cloud Computing environment in which 
an  organization  provides  and  manages  some  resources  in-
house  and  has  others  provided  externally.  For  example,  an 
organization  might  use  a  public  cloud  service,  such  as 
Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)  for  archived 
data but continue to maintain in-house storage for operational 
customer data. Ideally, the hybrid approach allows a business 
to  take  advantage  of  the  scalability  and  cost-effectiveness 
that  a  public  cloud  computing  environment  offers  without 
exposing mission-critical applications and data to third-party 
vulnerabilities[4].  
 
D. Private Cloud  
A  community  cloud  may  be  established  where  several 
organizations  have  similar  requirements  and  seek  to  share 
infrastructure  so  as  to  realize  some  of  the  benefits  of  cloud 
computing.  With  the  costs  spread  over  fewer  users  than  a 
public  cloud  (but  more  than  a  single  tenant)  this  option  is 
more  expensive  but  may  offer  a  higher  level  of  privacy, 
security  and/or  policy  compliance.  Examples  of  community 
cloud include Google's "Gov Cloud"[5]. 
 
V. ALL CLOUD MODELS ARE NOT THE SAME  
 

 

                               Fig(5) Cloud Computing Models 
 
Although  the  term  Cloud  Computing  is  widely  used,  it  is 
important to note that all Cloud Models are not the same. As 
such, it is critical that organizations don't apply a broad brush 
one-size fits all approach to security across all models. Cloud 
Models can be segmented into Software as a Service (Saas), 
Platform  as  a  service  (PaaS)  and  Integration  as  a  Service 
(IaaS). When  an  organization is considering Cloud Security 

it  should  consider  both  the  differences  and  similarities 
between these three segments of Cloud Models. 
 

VI. SAAS  COMPONENTS 

is 

important 

to  determine 

 
SaaS  delivery  model  consists  of  several  components  that 
have  been  developed  through  past  years,  nevertheless, 
employing  those  components  together  in  a  shared  and 
outsourced environment carries multiple challenges. Security 
and  Privacy  are  the  most  significant  challenges  that  may 
impede  the  Cloud  Computing  adoption.  Breaching  the 
security  of  any  component  impact  the  other  components’ 
security, consequently, the security of the entire system  will 
collapse.  In  this  section  we  study  the  security  issue  of  each 
component  and  discuss 
the  proposed  solutions  and 
recommendations.  
 
A. Service Level Agreement (SLA)  
Cloud  Computing  emerges  a  set  of    IT  management 
complexities,  and  using  SLA    in  cloud  is  the  solution  to 
guarantee  acceptable  level  of  QoS.  SLA  encompasses  SLA 
contract  definition,  SLA  negotiation,  SLA  monitoring,  and 
SLA  enforcement.  SLA  contract  definition  and  negotiation 
stage 
the  benefits  and 
responsibilities  of  each    party,  any  misunderstanding  will 
affect  the  systems  security  and  leave  the  client  exposure  to 
vulnerabilities. On the other hand, monitoring and enforcing 
SLA stage is crucial to build the trust between  the provider 
and  the  client.  To  enforce  SLA  in  a  dynamic  environment 
such  Cloud,  it  is  necessary  to  monitor    QoS  attributes 
continuously.  Web  Service  Level  Agreement  (WSLA) 
framework  developed  for  SLA  monitoring  and  enforcement 
in  SOA.  Using  WSLA  for  managing  SLA  in  Cloud 
Computing environment was proposed in by delegating SLA 
monitoring  and  enforcement  tasks  to  a  third  party  to  solve 
the  trust  problem.  Currently,  cloud  clients  have  to  trust 
providers’  SLA  monitoring  until  standardizing  Cloud 
Computing  systems  and  delegating  third-parties  to  mediate 
SLA monitoring and enforcement.  
 
B. Utility Computing  
Utility  computing  refers  to  the  ability  to  meter  the  offered  
services  and  charge  customers  for  exact  usage.  It  is 
interesting to note that the term originates from public utility 
services such as electricity. 
Utility  computing 
to  cloud 
computing  as  it  is  one  of  the  options  for  its  accounting.  As 
explained 
infrastructure,  Utility 
computing  is  a  good  choice  for  less  resource  demanding 
applications where peak usage is expected to be sporadic and 
rare. 
 
Still,  Utility  computing  does  not  require  Cloud  computing 
and  it  can  be  done  in  any  server  environment.  Also,  it  is 
unreasonable  to  meter  smaller  usage  and  economically 
inefficient when applied on a smaller scale. That is why it is 
most  often  applied  on  cloud  hosting  where  large  resources 
are  being  managed.  The  provider  is  the  main  responsible  to

  ISROSET- Int. J. Sci. Res. in Computer Science & Engineering       Vol-2, Issue-3, PP (1-5)  Jun  2014, E-ISSN: 2320-7639 

keep the system healthy and well functioning, but the client’s 
practice also affects the system.  
C. Cloud Software  
The  one  caveat  for  its  findings,  is  that  although  the  survey 
had  785  executive  level  respondents,  65%  of  these  were 
providers,  35%  were  customers,  and  their  responses  were 
combined  in  the  data.    It  would  have  been  nice  if  all  of  the 
results were available separately for each of these groups, but 
having  been  both  a  customer  and  a  provider,  I  know  that 
providers often have much better visibility into the aggregate 
situation  for  a  market.    Hence,  the  providers’  perspectives 
into such findings as the key drivers, inhibitors and trends for 
Cloud  Computing  adoption,  actually  represent  experiences 
across  their  entire  customer  base.    Additionally,  even  with 
the  mixed  respondents,  the  sheer  magnitude  of  some  of  the 
data  points,  as  well  as  their  percent  year-over-year  change, 
serve  as  another  proof  point  of  the  rapid  escalation  of 
adoption and market perceptions around Cloud.  

As a result of this research, we also discuss a Security Model 
for  SaaS  (SMI)    as  a  guide  for  assessing  and  enhancing 
security  in  each  layer  of  SaaS  delivery  model  as  shown 
below. SMI  model consists of three sides: IaaS components, 
security model, and the restriction level. The security model 
side includes three  vertical entities  where each entity covers 
the  entire  IaaS  components.  The  first  entity  is  Secure 
Configuration  Policy 
secure 
configuration  for  each  layer  in  IaaS  Hardware,  Software,  or 
SLA  configurations;  usually,  miss-configuration  incidents 
could 
the  system. 
Nevertheless,  we  hope  SMI  model  be  a  good  start  for  the 
standardization  of  IaaS  layers.  This  model  indicates  the 
relation between IaaS components and security requirements, 
and  eases  security  improvement  in  individual  layers  to 
achieve a total secure IaaS system[16].

D. Platform Virtualization  
Virtualization, a fundamental technology platform for Cloud 
Computing  services,  facilitates  aggregation  of  multiple 
standalone  systems  into  a  single  hardware  platform  by 
virtualizing  the  computing  resources  (e.g.,  network,  CPUs, 
memory,  and  storage).  Hardware  abstraction  hides  the 
complexity  of  managing  the  physical  computing  platform 
and  simplifies  the  computing  resources  scalability.  Hence, 
virtualization  provides  multi  tenancy  and  scalability,  and 
these are two significant characteristics of Cloud Computing 
As  the  hypervisor  is  responsible  for  VMs  isolation,  VMs 
could  not  be  able  to  directly  access  others’  virtual  disks, 
memory,  or  applications  on  the  same  host.  IaaS,  a  shared 
environment, demands an accurate configuration to maintain 
strong 
isolation.  Cloud  service  providers  undertake  a 
substantial effort to secure their systems in order to minimize 
the  threats  that  result  from  communication,  monitoring, 
modification,  migration,  mobility,  and  DoS.  In  this  section, 
we  discuss  virtualization  risks  and  vulnerabilities  that  affect 
particularly  IaaS  delivery  model  in  addition  to  the  recent 
proposed  solutions  to  guarantee  security,  privacy,  and  data 
integrity for IaaS[17].

VIII.   CONCLUSION 

 
In This paper we discuss about Various level of  Software  as

describe a single thing – rather it is a universal term that sits 
over a variety of services from  Software as a  Service at the 
base,  through  Platform  as  a  Service  as  a  development    tool 
and    through    to  infrastructure  as  a  Service  replacing  on-

been  presented  A  number  of  new  challenges  that  is 
inherently  connected  to  the  new  cloud  paradigm    has  also 
been    deliberated  in  the  paper.  As  secure  data  storage  in 
cloud  environment  is  a  significant  concern  which    prevents 
many  users  from    using  the  cloud,  a  practical  solution  to 
provide security and privacy for user data, when it is located 
in a public cloud, was also discussed in this paper. The  need
