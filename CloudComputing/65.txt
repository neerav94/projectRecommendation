Abstract: Cloud computing considered as new IT technology developed to process the users and organization activities [1]. However, the 
main objective of cloud computing is to centralized the processes of IT services and infrastructures and gather the information with user’s 
through many applications through internal or external network. Cloud computing is like virtual machine that contain central information,
services and hardware as one main system for all employees and departments inside the organization rather than IT system for each sector 
in  the  organizations[2].  The  initial  idea  of  cloud  computing  was  founded  by  IBM  in  1950’s  by  developed  processing  machines  called
“Remote Job Entry” with special features such as speed CPU’s and large storages capacity to allow many user’s to use the same machine at 
the  same  time[3].  Therefore,  cloud  computing  technology  developed  to  provide  efficient  online  services  and  infrastructure  for  various
organizations to operate and process their activities using external and internal networks without need to install real IT system environment.

1. Introduction 

This  paper  discusses  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing 
technology by academic institutes. Thus, the cloud computing 
reviewing is necessary to understand cloud computing aspects; 
cloud  computing  definition,  cloud  service,  deployment 
approaches, and adoption variables. The paper will review the 
cloud  computing  experiment  in  three  academic  institutes; 
Malaysia  Universities,  Jordon  universities  and 
Indian 
Universities. 

2. What is A Cloud Computing? 

Until  today,  there  is  no  standard  definition  for  cloud 
computing technology due to continues cloud techniques and 
strategies  developments  and  complicated  architecture  of 
different  cloud  computing  field’s  integration  i.e.  internet, 
operating  systems  and  software  engineering  [4].  Therefore, 
many researchers and institutions define the cloud computing 
based on different visions such as service, architecture layers 
and aims of cloud computing. The most maximal definition of 
cloud computing is NIST definition which describe the cloud 
technology  as  “a  model  for  enabling  convenient,  on-demand 
network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing 
resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and 
services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service  provider  interaction”. 
According NIST detention, the researchers classifies the cloud 
computing  as  many  concepts;  cloud  computing  services, 
architecture layers, deployment approaches and purposes [5].

3. Cloud Computing Service

There are three main cloud computing service; Software as a 
service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure 
as a Service (IaaS) [6]. 

A. Software as a service(SaaS) : 

This type of services focus on the software and service of IT 
systems  such  as  recording  applications,  finical  applications 
and  reports  applications  in  various  domains  like  health, 
education  and  economic.  Therefore,  SaaS  provide  online 
user’s interfaces as connection points between end users and 
organization services.  

B. Platform as a service (PaaS) 

The main purpose of PaaS is to manage, control, process and 
operate the gather information between different applications

and  systems  storages  and 
infrastructures.  Thus,  PaaS 
considered  cloud  computing  operating  system  to  operate  the 
gather  information  between  SaaS  and  IaaS  sides.  There  are 
many  bold  PaaS  examples  such  as  online  programming 
language  debugger,  tasks  interruptions  management  and
automated daily operations. 

C. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 

It  is  the  higher  services  layer  in  cloud  computing  services 
structure;  SaaS  represent  the  infrastructure  that  responsible 
about store systems operating systems, applications, data and 
information and the network requirement to connect between 
cloud  services.  Therefore,  SaaS  considered  as  systems 
hardware  and  storages  resources.  Figure.  2  illustrate  the 
structure of cloud computing services.

4. Cloud Computing Deployment Approaches 

Most of researchers classify the cloud computing deployment 
approaches  to  three  main  approaches  which  are;  Public, 
Private,  Hybrid;  and  other  researcher  added  community 
approach as special deployment approach of cloud computing. 
However, each of cloud computing deployment approach has 
its own characteristics such as costs, security and availability, 
and  the  organization  can  decide  the  suitable  deployment 
approach  for  its  businesses  based  on  working  environment. 
Figure  3  illustrates  the  cloud  computing  approaches  and 
characteristics of each approach. 

A. Public Cloud

Public cloud is deployment approach that allows organizations 
or  users  to  use  the  cloud  resources.  Therefore,  public  cloud 
uses  WWW  networks  as  infrastructure  to  communicate 
between customers and cloud resources. The main advantage 
of  this  approach  is  globalizing  the  business  markets which 
give  the  organization  the  opportunities  to  maximize  their 
consumers and publish their products widely [7], [8], [9]. 

B. Private Cloud 

Private  deployment  approach  allows  single  or  many 
organizations  to  centralize  their  services  and  infrastructure 
using  internal  network.  Therefore,  private  approach  provides 
local  cloud resources.  The  main  advantages  of  this  approach 
are reducing the infrastructure and services costs, manage the 
organizations tasks efficiently and provide high level of data 
security. However, private cloud is effective for medium and 
small  bossiness  which  focus  on  local  customers  rather  than 
global consumers [7], [8], [9].  

C. Hybrid Cloud 

Hybrid  Cloud  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  cloud 
models  or  more  clouds  that  try  to  address  the  limitations  of 
each  approach,  but  are  bound  together  by  standardized  or 
proprietary  technology  that  enable  data  and  application 
portability. In hybrid cloud, part of service infrastructure runs 
in private cloud while the remaining part runs in public clouds. 
Hybrid  cloud  offer  more  flexibility  than  both  public  and 
private cloudsv[7], [8], [9].  

D. Community Cloud  

A community  cloud contains features of both the public and 
private  cloud  models.  Like  a  public  cloud,  the  community 
cloud  may  contain  software,  data  storage,  and  computing 
resources  used  by  multiple  organizations.  Where  this  model 
differs from the public model is that the infrastructure is used 
exclusively by a group of organizations known to each other 
[7], [8], [9]. 

Figure 3: Cloud deployment approach 

5. Cloud Computing Adaption Variables 

Cloud  computing  technology  offer  many  advantages  over 
other  IT  systems  due  to  many  characteristics  such  as 
availability,  accessibility,  lower  costs  and  time  and  tasks 
management;  the  main  success  factor  of  cloud  computing  is

and  systems  storages  and 
infrastructures.  Thus,  PaaS 
considered  cloud  computing  operating  system  to  operate  the

Therefore,  cloud  computing  reduce  the  money  cost  of 
distributed 
service  availability  and 
accessibility  anytime  and  anywhere,  avoid  the  work  tasks 
conflictions thorough tasks management as one system rather 
than many systems and reduce the processing time to collect, 
retrieve,  process  and  share  data  and 
information.  The 
following characteristics are the main variables that represent 
the cloud computing importance for different organizations in 
various fields [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Reduce money costs and minimize IT operations budgets: 
through  centralized  the  software,  operating  systems, 
infrastructure and application, IT systems will reduce the 
costs of IT systems requirement in any organizations.  
Resources  availability  and  accessibility:  in  traditional  IT 
systems  resources  like  services  and  infrastructures  can 
used to complete the businesses tasks with in daily works 
hours, and when the working day ends the IT systems will 
be offline. On other hand, Cloud computing resources like 
services and infrastructures available 24 hours per day it 
can be used anytime and anywhere.  
Reduce  processing  and  tasks  time:  the  traditional  IT 
systems operated based on distribute resources structure. 
Therefore,  the  traditional  techniques  i.e.  papers  and 
external storages needed to collect, process, retrieve and 
share  information  between  organization  sectors.  Thus, 
there  are  wasted  time  prevent  the  organizations  from 
provide real time services.  
Tasks and data management: cloud computing technology 
avoids the responsibilities and roles conflictions between 
organizations  sectors  and  employees  through  automatic 
defining  for  the  permission  and  roles  of  each  employee 
and each sector. 

6. Cloud Computing Implementation in Higher 

Educational Institutes 

The  next  three  sections  will  discuss  the  cloud  computing 
implementations in universities of Malaysia, Jordan and India 
to  clarify  the  implementations  approach,  characteristics  and 
benefits  of  adapting  cloud  computing  technology  in  higher 
educational organizations. Table 1 show the main problems of 
the  current  systems  in  each  of  the  three  universities  and 
success factors of the cloud computing. 

1.

 Cloud computing in Malaysian Universities 

Although, the implementations of cloud computing technology 
still young in Malaysian universities, there are many practical 
and theoretical research focus on the challenges of current IT 
systems in Malaysian universities and the expected benefits of 
adapt cloud computing as a solution for these challenges. The 
most  findings  of  cloud  computing  researches  in  Malaysia 
focus  on 
services  availability,  accessibility  and 
management  of  information  and  activities  inside  Malaysian 
universities. However, one of the most important challenges in 

the 

Malaysian  universities  is  the  large  number  of  student’s  data 
and  information  instead  of 
the  necessary  services  and 
information to support the student’s activities [15], [16], [17]. 

2. Cloud Computing in Higher Education in Jordan 

In  Jordan  universities,  the  challenges  are  somehow  different 
than the Malaysian universities. However, the student numbers 
and  services  are  small  compare  with  Malaysian  universities. 
Therefore,  the  management  problem  is  not  bold  issue  in 
Jordan universities; there are two main challenges that lead the 
universities  in  Jordan  to  think  about  cloud  computing  which 
are;  reduce  the  costs  and  provide  services  availability.  In 
general,  IT  systems  budgets  in  Jordan  organization  are  low 
due to and problems of money resources in Jordan. Therefore, 
the  universities  looking  for  provide  efficient  services  with 
lowest costs [18], [19].  

3.

Implementation of Cloud Computing Indian Universities 

Educational organizational structure in India is more complex 
than  other  educational  systems.  Thus,  the  student’s  records, 
results  and  information  in  middle  and  high  education  levels 
interrelated  with  each  other.  In  other  words,  the  students 
accepted  in  universities  based  on  their  results  of  the  last7 
years.  Therefore,  the  student’s  information  processing  is 
continues.  On  other  hand,  many  educational  institutions  in 
India still use the papers system to record the information and 
provide  various  services.  Moreover,  the  resources  costs  are 
bold  issue  in  India  due  to  low  budgets  of  IT  systems  in 
educational  institutions.  The  cloud  computing  technology 
considered  as  powerful  solutions  for  various  and  complex 
problems of Indian educational institutions [20], [21].

gather  information  between  SaaS  and  IaaS  sides.  There  are 
many  bold  PaaS  examples  such  as  online  programming 
language  debugger,  tasks  interruptions  management  and
automated daily operations. 

C. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 

It  is  the  higher  services  layer  in  cloud  computing  services 
structure;  SaaS  represent  the  infrastructure  that  responsible 
about store systems operating systems, applications, data and 
information and the network requirement to connect between 
cloud  services.  Therefore,  SaaS  considered  as  systems 
hardware  and  storages  resources.  Figure.  2  illustrate  the 
structure of cloud computing services.

4. Cloud Computing Deployment Approaches 

Most of researchers classify the cloud computing deployment 
approaches  to  three  main  approaches  which  are;  Public, 
Private,  Hybrid;  and  other  researcher  added  community 
approach as special deployment approach of cloud computing. 
However, each of cloud computing deployment approach has 
its own characteristics such as costs, security and availability, 
and  the  organization  can  decide  the  suitable  deployment 
approach  for  its  businesses  based  on  working  environment. 
Figure  3  illustrates  the  cloud  computing  approaches  and 
characteristics of each approach. 

A. Public Cloud

Public cloud is deployment approach that allows organizations 
or  users  to  use  the  cloud  resources.  Therefore,  public  cloud 
uses  WWW  networks  as  infrastructure  to  communicate 
between customers and cloud resources. The main advantage 
of  this  approach  is  globalizing  the  business  markets which 
give  the  organization  the  opportunities  to  maximize  their 
consumers and publish their products widely [7], [8], [9]. 

B. Private Cloud 

Private  deployment  approach  allows  single  or  many 
organizations  to  centralize  their  services  and  infrastructure 
using  internal  network.  Therefore,  private  approach  provides 
local  cloud resources.  The  main  advantages  of  this  approach 
are reducing the infrastructure and services costs, manage the 
organizations tasks efficiently and provide high level of data 
security. However, private cloud is effective for medium and 
small  bossiness  which  focus  on  local  customers  rather  than 
global consumers [7], [8], [9].  

C. Hybrid Cloud 

Hybrid  Cloud  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  cloud 
models  or  more  clouds  that  try  to  address  the  limitations  of 
each  approach,  but  are  bound  together  by  standardized  or 
proprietary  technology  that  enable  data  and  application 
portability. In hybrid cloud, part of service infrastructure runs 
in private cloud while the remaining part runs in public clouds. 
Hybrid  cloud  offer  more  flexibility  than  both  public  and 
private cloudsv[7], [8], [9].  

D. Community Cloud  

A community  cloud contains features of both the public and 
private  cloud  models.  Like  a  public  cloud,  the  community 
cloud  may  contain  software,  data  storage,  and  computing 
resources  used  by  multiple  organizations.  Where  this  model 
differs from the public model is that the infrastructure is used 
exclusively by a group of organizations known to each other 
[7], [8], [9].

5. Cloud Computing Adaption Variables 

Cloud  computing  technology  offer  many  advantages  over 
other  IT  systems  due  to  many  characteristics  such  as 
availability,  accessibility,  lower  costs  and  time  and  tasks 
management;  the  main  success  factor  of  cloud  computing  is

Therefore,  cloud  computing  reduce  the  money  cost  of 
distributed 
service  availability  and 
accessibility  anytime  and  anywhere,  avoid  the  work  tasks 
conflictions thorough tasks management as one system rather 
than many systems and reduce the processing time to collect, 
retrieve,  process  and  share  data  and 
information.  The 
following characteristics are the main variables that represent 
the cloud computing importance for different organizations in 
various fields [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Reduce money costs and minimize IT operations budgets: 
through  centralized  the  software,  operating  systems, 
infrastructure and application, IT systems will reduce the 
costs of IT systems requirement in any organizations.  
Resources  availability  and  accessibility:  in  traditional  IT 
systems  resources  like  services  and  infrastructures  can 
used to complete the businesses tasks with in daily works 
hours, and when the working day ends the IT systems will 
be offline. On other hand, Cloud computing resources like 
services and infrastructures available 24 hours per day it 
can be used anytime and anywhere.  
Reduce  processing  and  tasks  time:  the  traditional  IT 
systems operated based on distribute resources structure. 
Therefore,  the  traditional  techniques  i.e.  papers  and 
external storages needed to collect, process, retrieve and 
share  information  between  organization  sectors.  Thus, 
there  are  wasted  time  prevent  the  organizations  from 
provide real time services.  
Tasks and data management: cloud computing technology 
avoids the responsibilities and roles conflictions between 
organizations  sectors  and  employees  through  automatic 
defining  for  the  permission  and  roles  of  each  employee 
and each sector. 

6. Cloud Computing Implementation in Higher 

Educational Institutes 

The  next  three  sections  will  discuss  the  cloud  computing 
implementations in universities of Malaysia, Jordan and India 
to  clarify  the  implementations  approach,  characteristics  and 
benefits  of  adapting  cloud  computing  technology  in  higher 
educational organizations. Table 1 show the main problems of 
the  current  systems  in  each  of  the  three  universities  and 
success factors of the cloud computing. 

1.

 Cloud computing in Malaysian Universities 

Although, the implementations of cloud computing technology 
still young in Malaysian universities, there are many practical 
and theoretical research focus on the challenges of current IT 
systems in Malaysian universities and the expected benefits of 
adapt cloud computing as a solution for these challenges. The 
most  findings  of  cloud  computing  researches  in  Malaysia 
focus  on 
services  availability,  accessibility  and 
management  of  information  and  activities  inside  Malaysian 
universities. However, one of the most important challenges in 

the 

Malaysian  universities  is  the  large  number  of  student’s  data 
and  information  instead  of 
the  necessary  services  and 
information to support the student’s activities [15], [16], [17]. 

2. Cloud Computing in Higher Education in Jordan 

In  Jordan  universities,  the  challenges  are  somehow  different 
than the Malaysian universities. However, the student numbers 
and  services  are  small  compare  with  Malaysian  universities. 
Therefore,  the  management  problem  is  not  bold  issue  in 
Jordan universities; there are two main challenges that lead the 
universities  in  Jordan  to  think  about  cloud  computing  which 
are;  reduce  the  costs  and  provide  services  availability.  In 
general,  IT  systems  budgets  in  Jordan  organization  are  low 
due to and problems of money resources in Jordan. Therefore, 
the  universities  looking  for  provide  efficient  services  with 
lowest costs [18], [19].  

3.

Implementation of Cloud Computing Indian Universities 

Educational organizational structure in India is more complex 
than  other  educational  systems.  Thus,  the  student’s  records, 
results  and  information  in  middle  and  high  education  levels 
interrelated  with  each  other.  In  other  words,  the  students 
accepted  in  universities  based  on  their  results  of  the  last7 
years.  Therefore,  the  student’s  information  processing  is 
continues.  On  other  hand,  many  educational  institutions  in 
India still use the papers system to record the information and 
provide  various  services.  Moreover,  the  resources  costs  are 
bold  issue  in  India  due  to  low  budgets  of  IT  systems  in 
educational  institutions.  The  cloud  computing  technology 
considered  as  powerful  solutions  for  various  and  complex 
problems of Indian educational institutions [20], [21].

Abstract: Cloud computing considered as new IT technology developed to process the users and organization activities [1]. However, the 
main objective of cloud computing is to centralized the processes of IT services and infrastructures and gather the information with user’s 
through many applications through internal or external network. Cloud computing is like virtual machine that contain central information,
services and hardware as one main system for all employees and departments inside the organization rather than IT system for each sector 
in  the  organizations[2].  The  initial  idea  of  cloud  computing  was  founded  by  IBM  in  1950’s  by  developed  processing  machines  called
“Remote Job Entry” with special features such as speed CPU’s and large storages capacity to allow many user’s to use the same machine at 
the  same  time[3].  Therefore,  cloud  computing  technology  developed  to  provide  efficient  online  services  and  infrastructure  for  various
organizations to operate and process their activities using external and internal networks without need to install real IT system environment. 

Keywords: Cloud Computing, Information Technology, Cloud Services, Cloud Architecture, Cloud Platforms 

1. Introduction 

This  paper  discusses  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing 
technology by academic institutes. Thus, the cloud computing 
reviewing is necessary to understand cloud computing aspects; 
cloud  computing  definition,  cloud  service,  deployment 
approaches, and adoption variables. The paper will review the 
cloud  computing  experiment  in  three  academic  institutes; 
Malaysia  Universities,  Jordon  universities  and 
Indian 
Universities. 

2. What is A Cloud Computing? 

Until  today,  there  is  no  standard  definition  for  cloud 
computing technology due to continues cloud techniques and 
strategies  developments  and  complicated  architecture  of 
different  cloud  computing  field’s  integration  i.e.  internet, 
operating  systems  and  software  engineering  [4].  Therefore, 
many researchers and institutions define the cloud computing 
based on different visions such as service, architecture layers 
and aims of cloud computing. The most maximal definition of 
cloud computing is NIST definition which describe the cloud 
technology  as  “a  model  for  enabling  convenient,  on-demand 
network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing 
resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and 
services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service  provider  interaction”. 
According NIST detention, the researchers classifies the cloud 
computing  as  many  concepts;  cloud  computing  services, 
architecture layers, deployment approaches and purposes [5]. 
Figure 1 represents the cloud computing definition visions. 

Figure 1: Visions of Cloud Computing Definitions 

3. Cloud Computing Service

There are three main cloud computing service; Software as a 
service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure 
as a Service (IaaS) [6]. 

A. Software as a service(SaaS) : 

This type of services focus on the software and service of IT 
systems  such  as  recording  applications,  finical  applications 
and  reports  applications  in  various  domains  like  health, 
education  and  economic.  Therefore,  SaaS  provide  online 
user’s interfaces as connection points between end users and 
organization services.  

B. Platform as a service (PaaS) 

The main purpose of PaaS is to manage, control, process and 
operate the gather information between different applications

and  systems  storages  and 
infrastructures.  Thus,  PaaS 
considered  cloud  computing  operating  system  to  operate  the 
gather  information  between  SaaS  and  IaaS  sides.  There  are 
many  bold  PaaS  examples  such  as  online  programming 
language  debugger,  tasks  interruptions  management  and
automated daily operations. 

C. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 

It  is  the  higher  services  layer  in  cloud  computing  services 
structure;  SaaS  represent  the  infrastructure  that  responsible 
about store systems operating systems, applications, data and 
information and the network requirement to connect between 
cloud  services.  Therefore,  SaaS  considered  as  systems 
hardware  and  storages  resources.  Figure.  2  illustrate  the 
structure of cloud computing services. 

 

Figure 2: Structure of Cloud computing Services 

4. Cloud Computing Deployment Approaches 

Most of researchers classify the cloud computing deployment 
approaches  to  three  main  approaches  which  are;  Public, 
Private,  Hybrid;  and  other  researcher  added  community 
approach as special deployment approach of cloud computing. 
However, each of cloud computing deployment approach has 
its own characteristics such as costs, security and availability, 
and  the  organization  can  decide  the  suitable  deployment 
approach  for  its  businesses  based  on  working  environment. 
Figure  3  illustrates  the  cloud  computing  approaches  and 
characteristics of each approach. 

A. Public Cloud

Public cloud is deployment approach that allows organizations 
or  users  to  use  the  cloud  resources.  Therefore,  public  cloud 
uses  WWW  networks  as  infrastructure  to  communicate 
between customers and cloud resources. The main advantage 
of  this  approach  is  globalizing  the  business  markets which 
give  the  organization  the  opportunities  to  maximize  their 
consumers and publish their products widely [7], [8], [9]. 

B. Private Cloud 

Private  deployment  approach  allows  single  or  many 
organizations  to  centralize  their  services  and  infrastructure 
using  internal  network.  Therefore,  private  approach  provides 
local  cloud resources.  The  main  advantages  of  this  approach 
are reducing the infrastructure and services costs, manage the 
organizations tasks efficiently and provide high level of data 
security. However, private cloud is effective for medium and 
small  bossiness  which  focus  on  local  customers  rather  than 
global consumers [7], [8], [9].  

C. Hybrid Cloud 

Hybrid  Cloud  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  cloud 
models  or  more  clouds  that  try  to  address  the  limitations  of 
each  approach,  but  are  bound  together  by  standardized  or 
proprietary  technology  that  enable  data  and  application 
portability. In hybrid cloud, part of service infrastructure runs 
in private cloud while the remaining part runs in public clouds. 
Hybrid  cloud  offer  more  flexibility  than  both  public  and 
private cloudsv[7], [8], [9].  

D. Community Cloud  

A community  cloud contains features of both the public and 
private  cloud  models.  Like  a  public  cloud,  the  community 
cloud  may  contain  software,  data  storage,  and  computing 
resources  used  by  multiple  organizations.  Where  this  model 
differs from the public model is that the infrastructure is used 
exclusively by a group of organizations known to each other 
[7], [8], [9].

5. Cloud Computing Adaption Variables 

Cloud  computing  technology  offer  many  advantages  over 
other  IT  systems  due  to  many  characteristics  such  as 
availability,  accessibility,  lower  costs  and  time  and  tasks

Educational Institutes 

The  next  three  sections  will  discuss  the  cloud  computing 
implementations in universities of Malaysia, Jordan and India 
to  clarify  the  implementations  approach,  characteristics  and 
benefits  of  adapting  cloud  computing  technology  in  higher 
educational organizations. Table 1 show the main problems of 
the  current  systems  in  each  of  the  three  universities  and 
success factors of the cloud computing.

 Cloud computing in Malaysian Universities 

Although, the implementations of cloud computing technology 
still young in Malaysian universities, there are many practical 
and theoretical research focus on the challenges of current IT 
systems in Malaysian universities and the expected benefits of

most  findings  of  cloud  computing  researches  in  Malaysia 
focus  on 
services  availability,  accessibility  and

universities. However, one of the most important challenges in 

the 

Malaysian  universities  is  the  large  number  of  student’s  data 
and  information  instead  of 
the  necessary  services  and

2. Cloud Computing in Higher Education in Jordan 

In  Jordan  universities,  the  challenges  are  somehow  different 
than the Malaysian universities. However, the student numbers 
and  services  are  small  compare  with  Malaysian  universities. 
Therefore,  the  management  problem  is  not  bold  issue  in 
Jordan universities; there are two main challenges that lead the 
universities  in  Jordan  to  think  about  cloud  computing  which 
are;  reduce  the  costs  and  provide  services  availability.  In 
general,  IT  systems  budgets  in  Jordan  organization  are  low 
due to and problems of money resources in Jordan. Therefore, 
the  universities  looking  for  provide  efficient  services  with 
lowest costs [18], [19].  

3.

Implementation of Cloud Computing Indian Universities 

Educational organizational structure in India is more complex 
than  other  educational  systems.  Thus,  the  student’s  records, 
results  and  information  in  middle  and  high  education  levels 
interrelated  with  each  other.  In  other  words,  the  students 
accepted  in  universities  based  on  their  results  of  the  last7 
years.  Therefore,  the  student’s  information  processing  is 
continues.  On  other  hand,  many  educational  institutions  in 
India still use the papers system to record the information and 
provide  various  services.  Moreover,  the  resources  costs  are 
bold  issue  in  India  due  to  low  budgets  of  IT  systems  in 
educational  institutions.  The  cloud  computing  technology 
considered  as  powerful  solutions  for  various  and  complex 
problems of Indian educational institutions [20], [21].

Abstract: Cloud computing considered as new IT technology developed to process the users and organization activities [1]. However, the 
main objective of cloud computing is to centralized the processes of IT services and infrastructures and gather the information with user’s 
through many applications through internal or external network. Cloud computing is like virtual machine that contain central information,
services and hardware as one main system for all employees and departments inside the organization rather than IT system for each sector 
in  the  organizations[2].  The  initial  idea  of  cloud  computing  was  founded  by  IBM  in  1950’s  by  developed  processing  machines  called
“Remote Job Entry” with special features such as speed CPU’s and large storages capacity to allow many user’s to use the same machine at 
the  same  time[3].  Therefore,  cloud  computing  technology  developed  to  provide  efficient  online  services  and  infrastructure  for  various
organizations to operate and process their activities using external and internal networks without need to install real IT system environment. 

Keywords: Cloud Computing, Information Technology, Cloud Services, Cloud Architecture, Cloud Platforms 

1. Introduction 

This  paper  discusses  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing 
technology by academic institutes. Thus, the cloud computing 
reviewing is necessary to understand cloud computing aspects; 
cloud  computing  definition,  cloud  service,  deployment 
approaches, and adoption variables. The paper will review the 
cloud  computing  experiment  in  three  academic  institutes; 
Malaysia  Universities,  Jordon  universities  and 
Indian 
Universities. 

2. What is A Cloud Computing? 

Until  today,  there  is  no  standard  definition  for  cloud 
computing technology due to continues cloud techniques and 
strategies  developments  and  complicated  architecture  of 
different  cloud  computing  field’s  integration  i.e.  internet, 
operating  systems  and  software  engineering  [4].  Therefore, 
many researchers and institutions define the cloud computing 
based on different visions such as service, architecture layers 
and aims of cloud computing. The most maximal definition of 
cloud computing is NIST definition which describe the cloud 
technology  as  “a  model  for  enabling  convenient,  on-demand 
network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable  computing 
resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and 
services)  that  can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with 
minimal  management  effort  or  service  provider  interaction”. 
According NIST detention, the researchers classifies the cloud 
computing  as  many  concepts;  cloud  computing  services, 
architecture layers, deployment approaches and purposes [5]. 
Figure 1 represents the cloud computing definition visions. 

Figure 1: Visions of Cloud Computing Definitions 

3. Cloud Computing Service

There are three main cloud computing service; Software as a 
service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure 
as a Service (IaaS) [6]. 

A. Software as a service(SaaS) : 

This type of services focus on the software and service of IT 
systems  such  as  recording  applications,  finical  applications 
and  reports  applications  in  various  domains  like  health, 
education  and  economic.  Therefore,  SaaS  provide  online 
user’s interfaces as connection points between end users and 
organization services.  

B. Platform as a service (PaaS) 

The main purpose of PaaS is to manage, control, process and 
operate the gather information between different applications

and  systems  storages  and 
infrastructures.  Thus,  PaaS 
considered  cloud  computing  operating  system  to  operate  the 
gather  information  between  SaaS  and  IaaS  sides.  There  are 
many  bold  PaaS  examples  such  as  online  programming 
language  debugger,  tasks  interruptions  management  and
automated daily operations. 

C. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 

It  is  the  higher  services  layer  in  cloud  computing  services 
structure;  SaaS  represent  the  infrastructure  that  responsible 
about store systems operating systems, applications, data and 
information and the network requirement to connect between 
cloud  services.  Therefore,  SaaS  considered  as  systems 
hardware  and  storages  resources.  Figure.  2  illustrate  the 
structure of cloud computing services. 

 

Figure 2: Structure of Cloud computing Services 

4. Cloud Computing Deployment Approaches 

Most of researchers classify the cloud computing deployment 
approaches  to  three  main  approaches  which  are;  Public, 
Private,  Hybrid;  and  other  researcher  added  community 
approach as special deployment approach of cloud computing. 
However, each of cloud computing deployment approach has 
its own characteristics such as costs, security and availability, 
and  the  organization  can  decide  the  suitable  deployment 
approach  for  its  businesses  based  on  working  environment. 
Figure  3  illustrates  the  cloud  computing  approaches  and 
characteristics of each approach. 

A. Public Cloud

Public cloud is deployment approach that allows organizations 
or  users  to  use  the  cloud  resources.  Therefore,  public  cloud 
uses  WWW  networks  as  infrastructure  to  communicate 
between customers and cloud resources. The main advantage 
of  this  approach  is  globalizing  the  business  markets which 
give  the  organization  the  opportunities  to  maximize  their 
consumers and publish their products widely [7], [8], [9]. 

B. Private Cloud 

Private  deployment  approach  allows  single  or  many 
organizations  to  centralize  their  services  and  infrastructure 
using  internal  network.  Therefore,  private  approach  provides 
local  cloud resources.  The  main  advantages  of  this  approach 
are reducing the infrastructure and services costs, manage the 
organizations tasks efficiently and provide high level of data 
security. However, private cloud is effective for medium and 
small  bossiness  which  focus  on  local  customers  rather  than 
global consumers [7], [8], [9].  

C. Hybrid Cloud 

Hybrid  Cloud  is  a  combination  of  public  and  private  cloud 
models  or  more  clouds  that  try  to  address  the  limitations  of 
each  approach,  but  are  bound  together  by  standardized  or 
proprietary  technology  that  enable  data  and  application 
portability. In hybrid cloud, part of service infrastructure runs 
in private cloud while the remaining part runs in public clouds. 
Hybrid  cloud  offer  more  flexibility  than  both  public  and 
private cloudsv[7], [8], [9].  

D. Community Cloud  

A community  cloud contains features of both the public and 
private  cloud  models.  Like  a  public  cloud,  the  community 
cloud  may  contain  software,  data  storage,  and  computing 
resources  used  by  multiple  organizations.  Where  this  model 
differs from the public model is that the infrastructure is used 
exclusively by a group of organizations known to each other 
[7], [8], [9].

5. Cloud Computing Adaption Variables 

Cloud  computing  technology  offer  many  advantages  over 
other  IT  systems  due  to  many  characteristics  such  as 
availability,  accessibility,  lower  costs  and  time  and  tasks 
management;  the  main  success  factor  of  cloud  computing  is

resource,  provide 

resources centralization using external and internal networks. 
Therefore,  cloud  computing  reduce  the  money  cost  of 
distributed 
service  availability  and 
accessibility  anytime  and  anywhere,  avoid  the  work  tasks 
conflictions thorough tasks management as one system rather 
than many systems and reduce the processing time to collect, 
retrieve,  process  and  share  data  and 
information.  The 
following characteristics are the main variables that represent 
the cloud computing importance for different organizations in 
various fields [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Reduce money costs and minimize IT operations budgets: 
through  centralized  the  software,  operating  systems, 
infrastructure and application, IT systems will reduce the 
costs of IT systems requirement in any organizations.  
Resources  availability  and  accessibility:  in  traditional  IT 
systems  resources  like  services  and  infrastructures  can 
used to complete the businesses tasks with in daily works 
hours, and when the working day ends the IT systems will 
be offline. On other hand, Cloud computing resources like 
services and infrastructures available 24 hours per day it 
can be used anytime and anywhere.  
Reduce  processing  and  tasks  time:  the  traditional  IT 
systems operated based on distribute resources structure. 
Therefore,  the  traditional  techniques  i.e.  papers  and 
external storages needed to collect, process, retrieve and 
share  information  between  organization  sectors.  Thus, 
there  are  wasted  time  prevent  the  organizations  from 
provide real time services.  
Tasks and data management: cloud computing technology 
avoids the responsibilities and roles conflictions between 
organizations  sectors  and  employees  through  automatic 
defining  for  the  permission  and  roles  of  each  employee 
and each sector. 

6. Cloud Computing Implementation in Higher 

Educational Institutes 

The  next  three  sections  will  discuss  the  cloud  computing 
implementations in universities of Malaysia, Jordan and India 
to  clarify  the  implementations  approach,  characteristics  and 
benefits  of  adapting  cloud  computing  technology  in  higher 
educational organizations. Table 1 show the main problems of 
the  current  systems  in  each  of  the  three  universities  and 
success factors of the cloud computing. 

1.

 Cloud computing in Malaysian Universities 

Although, the implementations of cloud computing technology 
still young in Malaysian universities, there are many practical 
and theoretical research focus on the challenges of current IT 
systems in Malaysian universities and the expected benefits of 
adapt cloud computing as a solution for these challenges. The 
most  findings  of  cloud  computing  researches  in  Malaysia 
focus  on 
services  availability,  accessibility  and 
management  of  information  and  activities  inside  Malaysian 
universities. However, one of the most important challenges in 

the 

Malaysian  universities  is  the  large  number  of  student’s  data 
and  information  instead  of 
the  necessary  services  and 
information to support the student’s activities [15], [16], [17]. 

2. Cloud Computing in Higher Education in Jordan 

In  Jordan  universities,  the  challenges  are  somehow  different 
than the Malaysian universities. However, the student numbers 
and  services  are  small  compare  with  Malaysian  universities. 
Therefore,  the  management  problem  is  not  bold  issue  in 
Jordan universities; there are two main challenges that lead the 
universities  in  Jordan  to  think  about  cloud  computing  which 
are;  reduce  the  costs  and  provide  services  availability.  In 
general,  IT  systems  budgets  in  Jordan  organization  are  low 
due to and problems of money resources in Jordan. Therefore, 
the  universities  looking  for  provide  efficient  services  with 
lowest costs [18], [19].  

3.

Implementation of Cloud Computing Indian Universities 

Educational organizational structure in India is more complex 
than  other  educational  systems.  Thus,  the  student’s  records, 
results  and  information  in  middle  and  high  education  levels 
interrelated  with  each  other.  In  other  words,  the  students 
accepted  in  universities  based  on  their  results  of  the  last7 
years.  Therefore,  the  student’s  information  processing  is 
continues.  On  other  hand,  many  educational  institutions  in 
India still use the papers system to record the information and 
provide  various  services.  Moreover,  the  resources  costs  are 
bold  issue  in  India  due  to  low  budgets  of  IT  systems  in 
educational  institutions.  The  cloud  computing  technology 
considered  as  powerful  solutions  for  various  and  complex 
problems of Indian educational institutions [20], [21].

7.1 A Federation Model for Education Using Hybrid Cloud 

Computing 

A  federation  model  was  proposed  in  order  to  bring  the 
advantages  of  cloud  computing  assisted  instructions  into full 
play.  The  model  showed  how  an  educational  application 
model of software (SaaS), platform (PaaS), and infrastructure 
(IaaS)  leverages  multiple  independent  clouds  by  creating  a 
federation  among  the  university  private  clouds  and  public 
clouds. A broker mechanism is proposed for better inter-cloud 
and inter-layer interoperation. The research has significance in 
constructing  more
