Abstract 
 
Even  though  the  release  cycles  are  speeder  with  agile  software  development  there  can  be  delays  with  respect  to  the 
insufficient  availability  of  underlying  platforms.  But  when  agile  using  the  cloud  can  overcome  the  delays  and  greatly 
enhance the speed of continuous integration and release cycles because of the large number of resources availability in 
the  cloud.  Effective  implementation  of  agile  practices  is  much  more  achievable  with  the  collaboration  of  cloud. 
Developing  software  on  time  and  within  budget  is  not  good  enough  if  the  product  developed  is  full  of  defects  and 
customers  today  are  demanding  higher  quality  software  than  ever  before.  Now-a-days  the  software  market  is  mature 
enough and users want to be assured of quality. There are several benefits and opportunities to maximize the agility of 
the software development process and practices with the help of cloud computing.

1. Introduction 
 
1 Over  the  years  many  different  software  methodologies 
have  been 
the  software 
engineering  community.  Developers  and  users  of  these 
methods  have  invested  significant  amount  of  time  and 
energy  in  improving  and  refining  them.  The  method  they 
choose  for  software  development  depends  on  the  type  of 
organization,  the  type  of  project  and  the  type  of  people 
involved. Agile software development methodologies have 
been  greeted  with  enthusiasm  by  many  software 
developers  because  work  is  done  at  different  levels  in 
parallel  (Craig  Larman,  2003).  We  can  use  our  creativity 
on  the  design  level  and  can  also  have  the  fun  of 
implementing the design in a smart way.  
  Handling 
requirements 
throughout  the  development  life  cycles  and  delivering 
products in short time frames and under budget constraints 
when compared with traditional development methods are 
the  two  most  significant  characteristics  of  the  agile 
approaches.  Even  though  the  release  cycles  are  speeder 
with agile software development there can be delays  with 
respect  to  the  insufficient  availability  of  underlying 
platforms.  But  when  agile  using  the  cloud  can  overcome 
the  delays  and  greatly  enhance  the  speed  of  continuous 
integration and release cycles because of the large number 
of 
the  cloud.  Effective 
implementation of agile practices is much more achievable 
with  the  collaboration  of  cloud.  Now  with  the  help  of 

cloud,  agile  software  development  is  accelerated  in  terms 
of efficiency and effectiveness.  
  The  present  research  work  focuses  on  the  impact  of 
cloud  computing  during  various  phases  of  agile  software 
development that affect the efficiency of software delivery 
in time and on budget 
  This research paper is organized as follows; section II

Agile  methods  deal  with  unstable 
and  volatile 
requirements  by  using  a  number  of  techniques,  some  of 
them  are  simple  planning,  short  iterations,  earlier  release,

determination  and  commitment  is  needed  (E.  Arisholm,

that  demanding 
certainty  in  the  face  of  uncertainty  is  dysfunctional.  They 
set  goals  and  constraints,  providing  boundaries  within 
which creativity and innovation can flourish (Leffingwell,

  User involvement is given high priority in the working

3. What cloud computing offers 
 
The  term  Cloud  Computing  refers  to  the  on-demand 
delivery of IT resources  via the Internet  with pay-as-you-
go pricing.  
The benefits of cloud computing can be listed as below: 
  Achieve economies of scale – increase volume output 
or productivity with fewer people. Your cost per unit, 
project or product plummets.  

  Reduce  spending  on  technology  infrastructure.

4.  Accelerating  agile  software  development  by  using 
cloud  
 
Developing  software  on  time  and  within  budget  is  not 
good enough if the product developed is full of defects and 
customers  today  are  demanding  higher  quality  software 
than  ever  before  (Coram,  M.,  2005).  Now-a-days  the 
software  market  is  mature  enough  and  users  want  to  be 

assured  of  quality.  Even  though  the  release  cycles  are 
speeder  with  agile  software  development  there  can  be 
delays  with  respect  to  the  insufficient  availability  of 
underlying platforms. But  when agile using the cloud can 
overcome  the  delays  and  greatly  enhance  the  speed  of 
continuous  integration  and  release  cycles  because  of  the 
large  number  of  resources  availability  in  the  cloud. 
Effective  implementation  of  agile  practices  is  much  more 
achievable with the collaboration of cloud.  
  Below  are  the  benefits  and  opportunities  to  maximize 
the  agility  of  the  software  development  process  and 
practices  with  the  help  of  cloud  computing  as  shown  in 
figure 2: 
  Reduces the lead time – Agile development teams are 
limited  to  one  physical  server.  But  when  cloud 
instances are used, practically an unlimited number of 
servers  are  available  for  development  teams.  This 
leads to the reduction of lead time since they need not 
to wait for physical server to become free to continue 
their work. 

  Speed  up  release  cycles  –  Even  though  agile 
methodology  is  used  for  software  development,  there 
can  be  delays  with  respect  to  the  availability  of 
underlying  platforms.  Having  a  large  number  of 
resources available in the cloud, the agile development 
team can overcome the delays and greatly enhance the 
speed of continuous integration and release cycles. 

  Accelerates  efficiency  and  effectiveness  –  Even 
though the agile software development team performs 
several  activities  in  parallel  and  also  in  serial,  the 
parallel activities are delayed due to lack of sufficient 
services.    Cloud  computing  can  push  it  towards 
parallel  activity  by  providing  the  required  services 
which accelerates efficient and effective agile software 
development. 

  Encourages  innovation  –  Cloud  encourages  the 
development  teams  to  innovate  and  experiment  new 
strategies  because  of  the  wide  range  of  available 
services. 

We  can  provision  platform  as  a  service  environments  for 
all  stages  such  as  development,  testing,  staging  and 
production.  This  will  make  sure;  they  have  all  the  base 
services,  such  as  databases,  application  servers,  artifact 
deployers,  service  handlers  and  API  managers  setup  in  a 
consistent manner and ready to go. When the developer is 
done developing the application or service, the artifact can 
be moved to the next environment for testing, and all that 
is  required  is  to  point  to  the  testing  environment  and  test 
the application by the QA team (Mc Breen, 2003). This is 
development governance with cloud computing.  
Project  creation,  repository  creation,  build  plans, 
 
triggering  builds  upon  commits  and  deploying  artifacts 
onto  the  servers  upon  successful  builds  can  all  be 
automated  with  a  cloud  based  integrated  setup.  In  other

1. Introduction 
 
1 Over  the  years  many  different  software  methodologies 
have  been 
the  software 
engineering  community.  Developers  and  users  of  these 
methods  have  invested  significant  amount  of  time  and 
energy  in  improving  and  refining  them.  The  method  they 
choose  for  software  development  depends  on  the  type  of 
organization,  the  type  of  project  and  the  type  of  people 
involved. Agile software development methodologies have 
been  greeted  with  enthusiasm  by  many  software 
developers  because  work  is  done  at  different  levels  in 
parallel  (Craig  Larman,  2003).  We  can  use  our  creativity 
on  the  design  level  and  can  also  have  the  fun  of 
implementing the design in a smart way.  
  Handling 
requirements 
throughout  the  development  life  cycles  and  delivering 
products in short time frames and under budget constraints 
when compared with traditional development methods are 
the  two  most  significant  characteristics  of  the  agile 
approaches.  Even  though  the  release  cycles  are  speeder 
with agile software development there can be delays  with 
respect  to  the  insufficient  availability  of  underlying 
platforms.  But  when  agile  using  the  cloud  can  overcome 
the  delays  and  greatly  enhance  the  speed  of  continuous 
integration and release cycles because of the large number 
of 
the  cloud.  Effective 
implementation of agile practices is much more achievable 
with  the  collaboration  of  cloud.  Now  with  the  help  of 

cloud,  agile  software  development  is  accelerated  in  terms 
of efficiency and effectiveness.  
  The  present  research  work  focuses  on  the  impact  of 
cloud  computing  during  various  phases  of  agile  software 
development that affect the efficiency of software delivery 
in time and on budget 
  This research paper is organized as follows; section II 
presents 
the 
importance  of  cloud  computing.  Section  IV  explains  how 
agile software development is accelerated using cloud. 
 
2. Agile Ideal 
 
Agile  methods  deal  with  unstable 
and  volatile 
requirements  by  using  a  number  of  techniques,  some  of 
them  are  simple  planning,  short  iterations,  earlier  release, 
plan driven, frequent customer feedback, etc.  
  These  are  the  factors  that  made  to  deliver  product 
release  in  short  period  compared  to  the  waterfall  model. 
Agile  methods  link  developers  and  stakeholders/users  to 
hit  the  mark  quickly  (Veerapaneni  Esther  Jyothi  2012). 
The identified strengths are listed below:  
  Simplicity (process, design, and code) 
  Accepting  changing 

  Stakeholders and users satisfaction 
  Refactoring, pair programming and frequent integration  
  Interactive, incremental and test – driven development. 
 
In Agile software development predefined set of steps 
may  not  lead  to  a  predictable  and  desirable  outcome 
because  of  changing  requirements  but  a  work  with 

the  agile 

ideals.  Section  III  Surveys

determination  and  commitment  is  needed  (E.  Arisholm, 
2007).  Agile  managers  understand 
that  demanding 
certainty  in  the  face  of  uncertainty  is  dysfunctional.  They 
set  goals  and  constraints,  providing  boundaries  within 
which creativity and innovation can flourish (Leffingwell, 
Dean, 2007). 
  User involvement is given high priority in the working 
style  of  agile,  drawing  user’s  right  in  to  the  heart  the

based  on  the  user’s  desire.  Agile  processes  is  the

Agile  methods  place  more  emphasis  on  people,

change rather than on tools, processes contracts and plans 
(Veerapaneni  Esther  Jyothi,  2010).  A  number  of  new

  One  of  the  advantages  of  adopting  an  agile  software

The Agile methodology can be summarized as below:  
  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  
  Working software over comprehensive documentation.  
  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
  Responding to change over following a plan. 
  Deliver product based on need from high priority down. 
  Eliminating waste wherever possible.

3. What cloud computing offers 
 
The  term  Cloud  Computing  refers  to  the  on-demand 
delivery of IT resources  via the Internet  with pay-as-you-
go pricing.  
The benefits of cloud computing can be listed as below: 
  Achieve economies of scale – increase volume output 
or productivity with fewer people. Your cost per unit, 
project or product plummets.  

  Reduce  spending  on  technology  infrastructure.

Conclusions 

What  makes  an  organization  agile  is  when  the  software 
that is being delivered is producing enough  value to  meet 
the business demand. In order to increase the value of our 
releases, we need to stop spending so much precious time 
racking  and  stacking 
infrastructure  and  managing 
application  servers  and  databases,  and  spend  more  time 
adding  valuable  features  for  our  business  partners  and 
customers. In other words, we need to embrace the cloud.
