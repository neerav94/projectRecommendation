World  of  small  scale  element  (atom/particle)  interaction  can  be 
successfully  described  by  quantum  mechanics,  especially,  photon  or 
mass less particle behaviors which has been well defined. Mind (spirit) 
has  been  established  as  coherent  light  (photon),  which  is  mass  less. 
Mind behaviors can also be described by quantum mechanics. Spirit 
is localized and delocalized in brain by wave particle duality, where the 
body network is connected by spirit network, while the brain function 
is performed by the collapse of spirit wave form, i.e. projection operator 
known as consciousness (and sub-consciousness). This means that the 
projection of mind (spirit) can form the consciousness operator, where 
the brain and body (organs) can be functioned and transformed to the 
classical world. Brain signals (cytokines) are formed by coherent light 
and localized in 3 dimensions (holography) in human brain, where the 
superposition of particles (waves) have their own space-time geometry. 
A  paradox  state  of  consciousness  is  a  sub-consciousness  state, 
which can be cloned (copied). The consciousness theory was proposed 
by many scientists [1-4], where the convincing theory of consciousness 
was  given  by  Penrose  [5].  The  theory  exposed  by  Penrose  and  his 
close colleague Hamer off is very detailed, where the story begins with 
Penrose's  distinction  between  "subjective"  and  "objective"  reduction 
[1]. Subjective reduction is what happens when an observer measures 
a quantity in a quantum system: the system is not in any specific state 
(the system is in a "super position" of possible states) until it is observed, 
in which the observation causes the system to reduce (or "collapse") 
to  a  specific  state.  This  is  the  only  reduction  known  to  traditional 
quantum  theory.  Objective  reduction  is  a  Penrose  discovery,  where 
part of his attempt at unifying relativity theory and quantum theory. In 
his opinion, consciousness must be a quantum phenomenon because 
neurons  are  too  big  to  account  for  consciousness.  Inside  neurons 
there is a "cytoskeleton", the structure that holds cells together, whose 
"micro-tubules" (hollow protein cylinders 25-nanometers in diameter) 
control the function of synapses. Penrose believes that consciousness 
is a manifestation of the quantum cytoskeletal state and its interplay 
between  quantum  and  classical  levels  of  activity.  Under  special 
circumstance,  the  system  must  then  collapse  to  that  one  state.  The 
collapse  of  the  wave  function  is  occurred,  where  the  universe  must 
choose between significantly differing space time geometry, for instance, 
the projection of brain signal to sensing cells. The link between brain 
signals and microtubules via cells can perform the neural (quantum) 
process, which is called the consciousness. These conformation states 
can interact with the neighboring states to represent, propagate and 
process information. 

Human  consciousness  has  become  the  key  of  investigations  for 
cognitive  scientists,  where  it  is  the  key  information  for  cognitive 
science study [6-8]. We know that it arises in the brain, but we don't 
know how or where in the brain, where it is exactly localized. We don't 
even know if it requires specialized brain cells (or neurons) or some 
sort  of  special  circuit  arrangement  of  them.  Till  date,  nobody  really 
knows what consciousness is, therefore, many scientists are seeking the 
way that consciousness to be the patterns of information, which can 
be transferred by electrons or photons, others will be able to copy it, 
edit it, sell it, or pirate it. It might be bundled with other information 

minds. The convincing concept can be categorized as the followings. 
String and spirit are the basic elements of matters and human beings 
in universe, respectively, where they are in the forms of coherent lights 
(photons), i.e. mass-less particles [9-11]. 

Regarding to quantum physics, the existence of photon in space 
and  time  is  satisfied  the  uncertainty  and  paradox  principles,  which 
means that the measurement of consciousness can be realized by using 
the probe that can be connected to the basic element of consciousness, 
i.e. spirit or mind, where in this work the wave-particle duality probe 
(photon) is recommended to form the required measurement [12,13]. 
In principle, consciousness and sub-consciousness is the paradox each 
other,  which  can  be  formed  by  the  paradox  states  between  waking 
and  sleeping  (dreaming)  situations,  where  the  uncertainty  principle 
between them is involved in the measurement process, which means 
that the measurement can be taken place, while the other information 
will be uncertained [13,14]. In applications, the consciousness and sub-
consciousness information can be experienced to be sensors such as 
color, smell, feeling, pleasure and fall in love, which will be useful for 
humanoid robotic applications [15,16], which is the important issue of 
research and investigations nowadays. 

In quantum physics, materials or non-materials can be existed and 
localized after projection (measurement and observation), otherwise, 
it is not existed. It is similar to Lord Buddha thought that human is 
not  existed  before  the  human  thought  forming.  Consciousness  and 
sub-consciousness are a paradox states each other, thus, they cannot 
be both localized exactly in the space-time geometry, which they can 
be localized in two different locations (paradox states). Mind (spirit) 
is formed by coherent light which is non-localized in 3 dimensions in 
brain. The projection of spirit (waves) can be connected to the required 
signals (sensors) under the consciousness situation, which is formed by 
sensor-cells-microtubules connection. Figure 1, the two quantum bits, 
α and β tubulins, are processed and formed the operation within the 
microtubules (quantum processor) [17]. 

Figure 2 shows the schematic of cell and microtubule connection 
[17]. Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that 
are  important  in  cell  signaling,  where  they  are  released  by  cells  and 
affect  the  behavior  of  other  cells,  and  sometimes  the  releasing  cell 
itself. In Figure 3, the quantum bit (Qubit) is operated and transferred
