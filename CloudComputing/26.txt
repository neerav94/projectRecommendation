INTRODUCTION 

Traditional  business  applications  and  platforms  are  very  complicated  and  expensive.  They  need  a  data  centre, 
complex softwares and a team of experts to run them. So cloud computing becomes more and more popular because of 
its  flexibility,  cost  effectiveness,  easy  deployment.  The  Cloud  Security  Alliance  (2009)  [1]  declares  that  the  “cloud 
describes the use of a collection of services, applications, information, and infrastructure comprised of pools of compute, 
network, information, and storage resources. As cloud computing offers so many benefits to businesses, its security and 
trustworthiness has always been in question. Security is an extremely important requirement for any IT application, as 
nobody  wants  their  data to  be  accessed  by  unauthorized  users.  There are many  cloud  security  methods  available  for 
external threats. The methods available for external attack have not been able to prevent data theft. Van Dijk and Juels 
have shown that the solutions like encryption and decryption are not  sufficient data protection mechanism when used 
alone  by  using  fully  homomorphic  encryption.  [2]  The  ability  to  leave  no  trace  of  an  attack  is  the  biggest  security 
challenge for this cloud environment. The lack of resources and evidence makes it difficult to find  cloud-based cyber 
attacks. Data theft attack detection is very difficult when attacker is insider. According to the 2011 CyberSecurity Watch 
Survey conducted on 607 businesses, government executives, professionals and consultants, 21% of cyber-attacks were 
caused by insiders. 33% of the respondents thought the insider attacks were more costly and damaging to organizations 
[3].  

Insiders may get the credentials of authorized user of by password sniffing or key logger etc for accessing system or 
network. Rocha and Correia show that it is very  easy  to steal passwords for a malicious insider of the Cloud service 
provider [4].Another case can be like  insider may attack on system by taking advantage of victim’s unwise trust like 
person leaves terminal open or allowing to use terminal to co-worker can be pose as masquerade attack. So that service 
provider cannot get idea of an attack on the system because attacker has identity of authorized user. The most common 
method used to detect masquerade attack is to keep record of user behaviour and to find anomalous behaviour. In this 
approach, user’s actions are proﬁled to form a baseline of normal behaviours. Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem 
proposed a different approach to secure cloud by using decoy information technology that they called as Fog Computing 
[5].

RELATED WORK 

Previous  work  on  detection  of  masquerade  attacks  was  focused  on  auditing  and  modeling  sequences  of  user 
commands including work on command sequences with information about arguments of commands [6, 7]. For detecting 
abnormal behaviour researcher applied statistical and machine learning algorithms. Maloof and Stephens also applied a 
user behaviour proﬁling technique to detect malicious insider activities violating ‘Need-to-Know’ policy [8].  Previous 
studies using multi-class training required gathering data from multiple users to train specific profiles of self and non-self 
for each user [9]. Different classifiers are also used to detect abnormal behaviour. Combination of different classifier can 
be a better solution to detect masquerades attack [10].  Traditional computer security defences will not be enough. It will 
take  a  combination  of  things  like  technical  defences,  intrusion  detection  systems,  process  and  more,  to  provide 
meaningful and powerful protection. 

Another framework is to create a feature set for user behaviours on GUI based systems for masquerade attack. 

They collected real user behaviour data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct feature.

 These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a 
user  session.  The  technique  of  user  identiﬁcation  and  masquerade  detection  as  a  binary  classiﬁcation  problem  uses 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) [11]. 
             Anomaly detection can produce false positives – a user’s behaviour is only anomalous because information such 
as meeting scheduling is not included – and a high meaningless true positive rate – that is, a user’s behaviour may be 
genuinely anomalous, but not in a dangerous way.  Bowen et al. proposed an automated system for generating decoy 

documents [12.13]. The system generated files are from diﬀerent templates with various themes, such as a health-related 

information theme, a ﬁnancial accounts theme, or a tax returns theme. 

III.  METHOD TO SECURE CLOUD WITH FOG 

 

 Cloud services are designed to provide easy and scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully 
managed  by  a cloud services  provider.  It  also  supplies  all  types  of  applications  like  online  data  storage  and  backup 
solutions,  Web-based  e-mail  services,  hosted  office  suites  and  document  collaboration  services,  database  processing, 
managed technical support services and more. The problem of desirable level of security for confidential data still exists. 
Many methods are proposed to secure cloud data by encryption and standard access control but it is found that 
the methods are not full proof due to variety of reasons. Customer not only requires reliable cloud environment but also a 
healthy security for data and applications. Recovering the stolen or lost data is not possible. So we must have knowledge 
to deal with such incidences. If we decrease the value of stolen data by providing decoy documents then we can limit the 
harm of the system. Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem propose extra security features are as follows [5]: 

 
1: User Behaviour Profile 
2: Decoys 
 

1. User Behaviour Profile:- 
 

 

 

 “Behavior”  of  any  given  user,  if  defined  appropriately,  would  be  very  hard  to  impersonate.  Unfortunately, 
behavior is turning out to be very hard to define. But it seems clear that for the Insider Misuse problem, some way to 
automatically  process  user  behavior  is  absolutely  necessary.  Cloud  service  provider  seems  that  user  accesses  data 
normally,  if  any  malicious  insider  accesses  data  from  cloud  because  insider  has  identity  of  victim.  To  detect  that 
illegitimate  access  the  well  known  technique  of  User  Profiling  should  be  used.  Abnormal  user  can  be  detected  by 
observing normal user behavior continuously. This behavior may contain volumetric information generally like which 
document/application/information he/she is accessing and for how many times, at what timings, for what purpose etc. 
Abnormal search behavior indicates variations from baseline i.e. of normal user behavior. This technique is generally 
used for fraud detection applications.  

               An authorized person of the system is friendly with the files or documents located on the system. The search or 
behavior of that user is likely to be targeted or finite. But masquerader who gets an access to the victim’s system can’t 
have an idea about the structure and content of the system. So their search or access can be misdirected or unbounded. 
According to Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem, this is possible masquerades attack. Based on these assumptions 
they developed the model with the help of one class modelling technique named as one class support vector machine. 
Benefit of one class support vector over two class is it has ability of building classifier without sharing data from other 
users.  The  privacy  of  user  data  is  maintained.  Experiments  done  by  them  indicate  that  we  could  reliably  detect 
masquerade attacks using this approach with a very low false positive rate of 1.12% [14]. 
 
2. Decoys:- 
 
              Decoy information like decoy documents or honey file or honey pot is placed in the system at the conspicuous 
location and stored by very enticing names. Illegitimate user feels that he is getting important information which is not 
the case. Decoys should be easily retrieved in order to maximize the likelihood that an attacker takes the bait. Decoys 
should not be easily identifiable to an attacker. It will help us to confuse to attacker. This method can be combined with 
the User behaviour profiling to secure cloud data. 
 
              When abnormal behaviour detected, decoy documents can be returned to user in such a way that it should look 
like normal. An authorized user of the system would easily understand that decoy information is returned by the cloud 
and  therefore  they  alter the  Cloud’s responses  by  different  ways,  such  as  challenge  questions  or  to inform the  Cloud 
security system that it has inaccurately detected an unauthorized access. If an unauthorized access is detected correctly 
then huge amount of bogus information will be provided to the user. With this method, we can achieve couple of benefits, 
first:  unauthorized access  is  detected  and  second:  we  can confuse  the attacker  by  providing  worthless information.  It

normally,  if  any  malicious  insider  accesses  data  from  cloud  because  insider  has  identity  of  victim.  To  detect  that 
illegitimate  access  the  well  known  technique  of  User  Profiling  should  be  used.  Abnormal  user  can  be  detected  by 
observing normal user behavior continuously. This behavior may contain volumetric information generally like which 
document/application/information he/she is accessing and for how many times, at what timings, for what purpose etc. 
Abnormal search behavior indicates variations from baseline i.e. of normal user behavior. This technique is generally 
used for fraud detection applications.  

               An authorized person of the system is friendly with the files or documents located on the system. The search or 
behavior of that user is likely to be targeted or finite. But masquerader who gets an access to the victim’s system can’t 
have an idea about the structure and content of the system. So their search or access can be misdirected or unbounded. 
According to Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem, this is possible masquerades attack. Based on these assumptions 
they developed the model with the help of one class modelling technique named as one class support vector machine. 
Benefit of one class support vector over two class is it has ability of building classifier without sharing data from other 
users.  The  privacy  of  user  data  is  maintained.  Experiments  done  by  them  indicate  that  we  could  reliably  detect 
masquerade attacks using this approach with a very low false positive rate of 1.12% [14]. 
 
2. Decoys:- 
 
              Decoy information like decoy documents or honey file or honey pot is placed in the system at the conspicuous 
location and stored by very enticing names. Illegitimate user feels that he is getting important information which is not 
the case. Decoys should be easily retrieved in order to maximize the likelihood that an attacker takes the bait. Decoys 
should not be easily identifiable to an attacker. It will help us to confuse to attacker. This method can be combined with 
the User behaviour profiling to secure cloud data. 
 
              When abnormal behaviour detected, decoy documents can be returned to user in such a way that it should look 
like normal. An authorized user of the system would easily understand that decoy information is returned by the cloud 
and  therefore  they  alter the  Cloud’s responses  by  different  ways,  such  as  challenge  questions  or  to inform the  Cloud 
security system that it has inaccurately detected an unauthorized access. If an unauthorized access is detected correctly 
then huge amount of bogus information will be provided to the user. With this method, we can achieve couple of benefits, 
first:  unauthorized access  is  detected  and  second:  we  can confuse  the attacker  by  providing  worthless information.  It

should be taken into consideration that decoy information should not cause any impact on normal user. By monitoring 
access to decoy information we can detect illegitimate user. 
 
Combining Two Methods:- 

 Salvatore  J.  Stolfo  and  Malek  Ben  Salem  propose  that  by  combining these  two  techniques,  we  can achieve 
highest level of security [5]. No other cloud security mechanism can provide such level of security. They applied this 
combined technique in local file system and their experimental results suggested that this combining approach will be 
very useful in cloud. 
The  combined  approach  suggests  that  first  to  detect  abnormal  behaviour  using  user  behaviour  profiling.  Abnormal 
behaviour can vary from normal user behaviour baseline. Normal user has an idea about the file structure and contents or 
documentation of the system. So his search is targeted, whatever file or document he wants to access, the location is 
likely to be known to him. And if not  known then he has some behaviour pattern to search data. According to these 
assumptions, model is prepared to find anomalous behaviour using one class support vector machine. After detecting 
abnormal behaviour they placed the traps in the system. Traps are the decoys which are downloaded from fog computing 
site.  Decoys  can  be  anything  like  important  transaction  reports,  receipts  of  online  purchase,  credit  card  statements, 
medical reports, tax returns forms, fake password etc. These documents are placed in noticeable location. But care is 
taken that these decoys should not be interfered with normal user. If normal user accesses these files then he or she will 
get that it is decoy document. And in case of normal user, unknowingly accesses decoy documents then to decide if he is 
authorized person or not, display set of challenge-response questions that the user must correctly respond to: The answers 
to  these  questions  are  given  by  the  owner  of  the  system  during the installation  of  the  system.  In reverse  way  user  is 
attacker then he or she will be in search of sensitive information such as bait information embedded in decoy document. 
While accessing decoys, attacker feels that he is getting important information but it is not.  
            Decoy document carry the Keyed- Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC). This is hidden in the header 
section of the document.   HMAC is computed over the file content using the key which is unique to each user. When 
these decoys loaded into memory, they calculate HMAC of the document using file content. And by comparing these two 
HMAC  addresses  decoy  document is  decided  and  alert is generated.  In  their  experiments  they  do  not  provide  decoy 
document on demand. Instead, they place decoy document in very conspicuous location by giving attractive names to 
directories. By doing this they are able to improve accuracy of detection. Combining these two techniques they get very 
low false positive rate.

 CONCLUSION 

Cloud security is one of the major important point to be considered in cloud computing. Masquerade or insider is the 
person  who  behaves  as  a  normal  user  by  stealing  credentials  of  authorized  person.  Insider  attack  is  very  difficult  to

The approaches are based on the predefined user behaviours and monitoring as well as profiling it using decoys. In case

very important and hard to detect attack i.e. insider attack can be handled and the data can be very well secured. The false

Abstract — Cloud computing is now a day in favour of all types of business units. We can access and store all types of 
application and  data in cloud.  As  it comes  up  with more  facilities,  it  becomes  exhausting to entrust  security.  Fog 
computing provides different security approaches than conventional slant like cryptography. By observing actions and 
reactions of user while accessing the data, we can find the anomalous behaviour. If unauthorised access detected even 
after going through challenging questions verification, then we can introduce disinformation attack and provide the 
fake worthless information to attacker. It will be useful to regulate effectiveness of data. Experiments done by author, 
shows that, this technique may provide extraordinary level of security for data in cloud computing environment. Fog 
computing is preventive disinformation attack.

INTRODUCTION 

Traditional  business  applications  and  platforms  are  very  complicated  and  expensive.  They  need  a  data  centre, 
complex softwares and a team of experts to run them. So cloud computing becomes more and more popular because of 
its  flexibility,  cost  effectiveness,  easy  deployment.  The  Cloud  Security  Alliance  (2009)  [1]  declares  that  the  “cloud 
describes the use of a collection of services, applications, information, and infrastructure comprised of pools of compute, 
network, information, and storage resources. As cloud computing offers so many benefits to businesses, its security and 
trustworthiness has always been in question. Security is an extremely important requirement for any IT application, as 
nobody  wants  their  data to  be  accessed  by  unauthorized  users.  There are many  cloud  security  methods  available  for 
external threats. The methods available for external attack have not been able to prevent data theft. Van Dijk and Juels 
have shown that the solutions like encryption and decryption are not  sufficient data protection mechanism when used 
alone  by  using  fully  homomorphic  encryption.  [2]  The  ability  to  leave  no  trace  of  an  attack  is  the  biggest  security 
challenge for this cloud environment. The lack of resources and evidence makes it difficult to find  cloud-based cyber 
attacks. Data theft attack detection is very difficult when attacker is insider. According to the 2011 CyberSecurity Watch 
Survey conducted on 607 businesses, government executives, professionals and consultants, 21% of cyber-attacks were 
caused by insiders. 33% of the respondents thought the insider attacks were more costly and damaging to organizations 
[3].  

Insiders may get the credentials of authorized user of by password sniffing or key logger etc for accessing system or 
network. Rocha and Correia show that it is very  easy  to steal passwords for a malicious insider of the Cloud service 
provider [4].Another case can be like  insider may attack on system by taking advantage of victim’s unwise trust like 
person leaves terminal open or allowing to use terminal to co-worker can be pose as masquerade attack. So that service 
provider cannot get idea of an attack on the system because attacker has identity of authorized user. The most common 
method used to detect masquerade attack is to keep record of user behaviour and to find anomalous behaviour. In this 
approach, user’s actions are proﬁled to form a baseline of normal behaviours. Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem 
proposed a different approach to secure cloud by using decoy information technology that they called as Fog Computing 
[5].

RELATED WORK 

Previous  work  on  detection  of  masquerade  attacks  was  focused  on  auditing  and  modeling  sequences  of  user 
commands including work on command sequences with information about arguments of commands [6, 7]. For detecting 
abnormal behaviour researcher applied statistical and machine learning algorithms. Maloof and Stephens also applied a 
user behaviour proﬁling technique to detect malicious insider activities violating ‘Need-to-Know’ policy [8].  Previous 
studies using multi-class training required gathering data from multiple users to train specific profiles of self and non-self 
for each user [9]. Different classifiers are also used to detect abnormal behaviour. Combination of different classifier can 
be a better solution to detect masquerades attack [10].  Traditional computer security defences will not be enough. It will 
take  a  combination  of  things  like  technical  defences,  intrusion  detection  systems,  process  and  more,  to  provide 
meaningful and powerful protection. 

Another framework is to create a feature set for user behaviours on GUI based systems for masquerade attack. 

They collected real user behaviour data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct feature.

 These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a 
user  session.  The  technique  of  user  identiﬁcation  and  masquerade  detection  as  a  binary  classiﬁcation  problem  uses 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) [11]. 
             Anomaly detection can produce false positives – a user’s behaviour is only anomalous because information such 
as meeting scheduling is not included – and a high meaningless true positive rate – that is, a user’s behaviour may be 
genuinely anomalous, but not in a dangerous way.  Bowen et al. proposed an automated system for generating decoy 

documents [12.13]. The system generated files are from diﬀerent templates with various themes, such as a health-related 

information theme, a ﬁnancial accounts theme, or a tax returns theme. 

III.  METHOD TO SECURE CLOUD WITH FOG 

 

 Cloud services are designed to provide easy and scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully 
managed  by  a cloud services  provider.  It  also  supplies  all  types  of  applications  like  online  data  storage  and  backup 
solutions,  Web-based  e-mail  services,  hosted  office  suites  and  document  collaboration  services,  database  processing, 
managed technical support services and more. The problem of desirable level of security for confidential data still exists. 
Many methods are proposed to secure cloud data by encryption and standard access control but it is found that 
the methods are not full proof due to variety of reasons. Customer not only requires reliable cloud environment but also a 
healthy security for data and applications. Recovering the stolen or lost data is not possible. So we must have knowledge 
to deal with such incidences. If we decrease the value of stolen data by providing decoy documents then we can limit the 
harm of the system. Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem propose extra security features are as follows [5]: 

 
1: User Behaviour Profile 
2: Decoys 
 

1. User Behaviour Profile:- 
 

 

 

 “Behavior”  of  any  given  user,  if  defined  appropriately,  would  be  very  hard  to  impersonate.  Unfortunately, 
behavior is turning out to be very hard to define. But it seems clear that for the Insider Misuse problem, some way to 
automatically  process  user  behavior  is  absolutely  necessary.  Cloud  service  provider  seems  that  user  accesses  data 
normally,  if  any  malicious  insider  accesses  data  from  cloud  because  insider  has  identity  of  victim.  To  detect  that 
illegitimate  access  the  well  known  technique  of  User  Profiling  should  be  used.  Abnormal  user  can  be  detected  by 
observing normal user behavior continuously. This behavior may contain volumetric information generally like which 
document/application/information he/she is accessing and for how many times, at what timings, for what purpose etc. 
Abnormal search behavior indicates variations from baseline i.e. of normal user behavior. This technique is generally 
used for fraud detection applications.  

               An authorized person of the system is friendly with the files or documents located on the system. The search or 
behavior of that user is likely to be targeted or finite. But masquerader who gets an access to the victim’s system can’t 
have an idea about the structure and content of the system. So their search or access can be misdirected or unbounded. 
According to Salvatore J. Stolfo and Malek Ben Salem, this is possible masquerades attack. Based on these assumptions 
they developed the model with the help of one class modelling technique named as one class support vector machine. 
Benefit of one class support vector over two class is it has ability of building classifier without sharing data from other 
users.  The  privacy  of  user  data  is  maintained.  Experiments  done  by  them  indicate  that  we  could  reliably  detect 
masquerade attacks using this approach with a very low false positive rate of 1.12% [14]. 
 
2. Decoys:- 
 
              Decoy information like decoy documents or honey file or honey pot is placed in the system at the conspicuous 
location and stored by very enticing names. Illegitimate user feels that he is getting important information which is not 
the case. Decoys should be easily retrieved in order to maximize the likelihood that an attacker takes the bait. Decoys 
should not be easily identifiable to an attacker. It will help us to confuse to attacker. This method can be combined with 
the User behaviour profiling to secure cloud data. 
 
              When abnormal behaviour detected, decoy documents can be returned to user in such a way that it should look 
like normal. An authorized user of the system would easily understand that decoy information is returned by the cloud 
and  therefore  they  alter the  Cloud’s responses  by  different  ways,  such  as  challenge  questions  or  to inform the  Cloud 
security system that it has inaccurately detected an unauthorized access. If an unauthorized access is detected correctly 
then huge amount of bogus information will be provided to the user. With this method, we can achieve couple of benefits, 
first:  unauthorized access  is  detected  and  second:  we  can confuse  the attacker  by  providing  worthless information.  It

access to decoy information we can detect illegitimate user.
