Abstract—Since  last  four  decades,  internet  exploration  and 
innovation has touched new horizons but all that advancement 
in  realm  of  internet  was  based  on  peer  to  peer  interaction  or 
mostly  client  server  topology.  There  were  many  loop  holes  in 
such  configuration  as  all  the  communication  was  machine 
identified and all the available resources in the network were not 
fully  utilized,  therefore  a  more  vigorous  content  centric  model 
was proposed and is expanding at a very fast pace in which all 
the data is named and could be searched on the basis of name, 
instead  of  machine  address.  There  are  many  open  challenges 
faced by content centric networks, one is naming of huge amount 
of  data  available  and  efficiently  addressing 
this  data 
dynamically  and  caching  of  huge  information  and  its  fast 
addressing. The other issue of importance is congestion control 
where no host to host based communication is taking place and 
the  nodes  are  searching  and  transferring  required  data  in  an 
independent fashion. The economical solution to the problem of 
global  deployment  of  this  new  technique.  In  our  approach,  we 
have  suggested  and  implemented  a  new  model  that  provides 
remedies  for  current  bottlenecks  in  CCN  by  incorporating  the 
advantages  offered  by  cloud  computing  with  little  overheads. 
We  have  divided  content  centric  networks  in  the  form  of  tiers 
based  on  the  similarity  of  information  that  they  handle  every 
day in close vicinity, the tiers are further divided in to clusters 
whose size and number would be dependent upon the number of 
users.  The  new  approach  has  been  given  the  names  clustered 
CCN or CCCN.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Internet based communication was originally designed for 
host to host or peer to peer with every machine on the internet 
having  unique  identifiers  and  all  the  communication  and 
routing  is  address  based.  Most  of  the  communication  on 
internet  is  client  server  based  e.g.  World  Wide  Web  is 
providing  its  server  based  services  to  most  of  the  internet 
users worldwide to date. 

This scheme is though simple and conventional but has not 
capitalized the full capacity and potential of the network and 
many  of  available  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
especially when they can be easily available locally. A most 
common example is that Alice wants to get a certain MP3 file 
from a remote server or a copy of it may be placed at a local 
CDN, if that is a popular and most visited Server or CDN then 
Alice has to wait for a remotely placed, busy location whereas 
the  same  information  may  have  been  downloaded  by  an 
adjacent machine in the same local network that may be easily

accessible  as  compared  to  the  previous  situation.  Most  of 
internet  today  is  based  on  content  distribution  e.g.  file 
exchange, audio video streaming etc. that are placed usually 
at popular servers  and    is  mostly  dependent  on  the  location 
where the information is currently placed. Though the use of 
CDN’s  has  helped  in  this  regard  but  they  prove  to  be 
expensive and also ensuring their availability is crucial. Also 
security  related 
issues  arise  regarding  content  easily 
misplaced  over  ordinary  unsecure  connections.  Different 
authentication  and  confidentiality  measures  need  to  be 
adopted  on  node  to  node  interaction  level,  whereas  if  data 
itself is authenticated as in named content technique, need for 
authentication  and  formation  of  VPN’s  is  eliminated  and 
more  suitable  and  reliable  security  measure  based  on  data 
itself can be introduced which will be free from hackers and 
intruders intervention. Another issue related to conventional 
IP based network is the restriction of mobility as we bind a 
host  to  its  location  rather  than  by  the  data  it  contains.  As 
current internet tends to adopt to mobility at a very rapid rate 
so the ordinary use of patching devices with their addresses 
(either  IP  addresses  or  MAC  addresses)  results  in  rigorous 
network  forwarding  based  on  the  location  of  information 
where  the  host  is  placed  rather  than  the  information  name 
itself. Name content centric Networking was introduced few 
years back to propose the shape of future networks and rectify 
the  legacies  of  the  current  TCP/IP  based  communication 
model. Instead of IP node the basic entity, named data is the 
central nexus. CCN architecture consists of named data layout, 
caching within the network and transmission dependent on the 
receiver [1]-[3]. First an interest packet is forwarded that may 
contain  the  name  of  particular  data  required  or  a  prefix  of 
named data dependent on whatever convention is used in the 
network  from  a  host  that  want  to  retrieve  some  data.  The 
network  is  equipped  with  intrinsic  cache  systems  that  are 
sometimes embedded with intermediate routers.  The routers 
used  are  specialized  routers  which  search  and  forward  the 
content  based  on  the  content  name.  The  forwarded  interest 
packet would traverse through the network and on finding a 
match  first  authenticates  and  requests  the  remote  node  that 
may be a cache or any other machine containing the data to 
send that data back to the sender that has initiated the interest 
packet. Now the receiver would forward the data packet to the 
sender  that  is  intermediately  stored  by  routers  or  other 
allowed storage machines as it travels back. The data packets 
traverse  the  same  path  as  that  of  interest  packet.  The 
intermediate  storage  is  for  future  use  of  that  particular  data 
from a local location that was recently retrieved. The data is 
stored along with the version and timing in order to update if a 
fresh copy is available. There are three data structures held by 
each CCN node namely content store (CS), pending interest

table  (PIT)  and  forwarding  information  base  (FIB).  The 
request generated called interest for a particular packet is first 
searched in the local content store and if a match is found, it is 
forwarded locally, if a match is not found then it is searched in 
Pending  interest  table  and  if  a  match  is  found,  meaning 
already  a  pending  request  for  same  data  is  there,  then  the 
interface is the PIT is updated so that when the required data 
is found, it would be forwarded to all the pending interfaces. 
If no match is found in PIT then it is forwarded to FIB, for a 
match. If a match is found, a new entry is made in PIT and the 
interest is forwarded. The path of data return is the same as 
that of the interest. Thus the  major  advantages  gain  in  such 
kind of architecture are reduced congestion owing to content 
caching, better delivery speed, basic and simple configuration 
nomenclature for network devices  and  providing  security  at 
data level instead of network devices based [4]. Comparison 
of CCN with conventional TCP/IP stack. ( See Fig. 1).

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  concept  was  introduced  about  a  mere 
decade ago and since then it has seen a tremendous positive 
response  due  to  the  availability  of  virtual  servers  and  open 
source  utilization.  The  offering  of  application  service 
provision at a remote location has led to the introduction of 
almost all sorts of solutions online ranging from hardware to 
software. The remote renting of resources helps especially in 
the  paradigm  of  information  storage  anywhere  without  the 
need  to  actually  buy  hardware  and  its  corresponding 
maintenance and related software update. The three platforms 
generally offered under the umbrella of cloud computing are 
Software  as  Service,  Platform  as  Service,  Infrastructure  as 
service.  This  concept  of  remote  handling  of  provisioned 
resources can prove very helpful in content centric networks 
[7], and in our model we will use the caching of resources via 
cloud in order to reduce cost and effort for installation of new 
hardware  especially  for  base  controllers  in  our  project  that 
would be located at the edge of each tier.

Though  content  centric  networking  offers  a  very  handy 
option for an alternate approach towards our current internet 
services  but  there  are  many  challenges  in  its  effective 
ubiquitous  implementation  [8],  [9].  There  are  four  basic 
problems that we have tried to  rectify in our new approach. 
Those  problems 
cache 
management, and Congestion control and deployment issues. 
There  are  about  more  than  of  the  order  of  105  unique  data 
objects worldwide that needs to be named and a robust and 
efficient  routing  as  well  as  resolution  system  is  required  in 
order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.  

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  basic  methodology  of  project  is  to  divide  the  global 
access into multiple tiers and clusters and the new technique is 
given  the  name  Clustered  CCN,  those  tiers  are  not  the 
conventional tiers as we interpret in terms of internet service 
providers.  These  tiers  are  formed  on  the  basis  of  level  and 
type of data that is generated in particular vicinity. Those tiers 
may  be  formed  by  users  independent  of  ISP’s,  by  simply 
joining based on the type of information they require mostly. 
But we have divided for simplicity our CCCN into three tiers.

order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.  

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  basic  methodology  of  project  is  to  divide  the  global 
access into multiple tiers and clusters and the new technique is 
given  the  name  Clustered  CCN,  those  tiers  are  not  the 
conventional tiers as we interpret in terms of internet service 
providers.  These  tiers  are  formed  on  the  basis  of  level  and 
type of data that is generated in particular vicinity. Those tiers 
may  be  formed  by  users  independent  of  ISP’s,  by  simply 
joining based on the type of information they require mostly. 
But we have divided for simplicity our CCCN into three tiers.

Increased  granularity  at  base  level  would  ensure  better 
handling  of  named  contents.  Numerous  clusters  would  be 
formed within a particular tier based on the number of users 
and connections in the near vicinity. At the edge of each tier, a 
base controller is introduced that would be similar to a CDN. 
Each  tier  would  have  a  special  search  preference  within  it 
before passing through base controller for search of data into 
another  tier.  A  particular  tier  form  a  type  of  Adhoc 
configuration  with  the  advantage  of  fast  searching  and 
matching  as  special  identifiers  are  appended  along  with  the 
name prefix. 

Tier-I consist of ordinary customers, that are either mobile 
or  immobile  or  Adhoc  based.  In  Tier-I  There  could  be 
multiple clusters but for simplicity we have considered only 
one cluster per tier. The advantage of cluster is that with in a 
tier,  data  is  first  searched  in  the  current  cluster  and  then 
adjoining  clusters  of  a  particular  tier.  For  a  CCN  interest 
request  generated  by  any  of  the  hosts  with  in  a  cluster,  it 
would first be routed within that particular cluster of that tier. 
The  routing  scheme  for  each  tier  would  be  different.  If 
nothing found in the first tier of cluster of machines, it would 
be forwarded to next tier through a base controller that would 
be  monitoring  the  requests  flow  and  data  between  adjacent 
tiers. This approach would be similar to Tier based cluster of 
Adhoc nodes with the only exception that once an interest is 
not  successful  in  a  particular  tier,  it  would  be  routed  via  a 
central  Base  Controller  of  that  particular  tier  that  would 
update  its  information  after  every  successful  data  retrieval 
from the other tier. In our topology we have supposed that ISP 
has  no  restriction  on  the  storage  of  data  in  any  particular 
device  or  networking  node.  In  a  particular  tier,  the  data 
naming would be local and would be differentiated from the 
other  tier  by  means  of  identifier  in  each  particular  tier  that 
would be unique, though the name of data would be the same 
but  only  the  addressing  and  routing  convention  would  be 
simplified  by  appending  a  particular  identifier  with  the 
naming  prefix  in  the  order  of  hierarchical  name  that  can 
simplify  the  search  for  similar  data  routes  and  would  be 
included  in  the  scope  area  of  the  interest  packet.  This 
technique can ensure a fast data routing based on the prefix 
identifier  of  that  particular  tier.  When  a  particular  tier  is 
unsuccessful in retrieving data, the timer would  live  on  and 
would  be  readjusted  at  the  base  controller  along  with 
appending new prefix identifier for the next tier and removing 
the  previous  identifier.    The  same  cycle  is  repeated  for  the 
second and third tier. The second tier would be a broad based 
tier whose cluster would cover up to a particular country level. 
When  the  interest  request  arrives  in  tier-II,  it  would  be 
processed in the same fashion and if the data is not found in 
tier-II  then  it  would  be  forwarded  to  tier-III  by  passing 
through  another  base  controller.  The  introduction  of  base 
controller ensures that even if a device that may have the copy 
of information is not active then ultimately based controller 
can provide the data, if it was previously requested via it as it 
updates  its  database  on  each  request  through  it,  so  in  this 
fashion  not  only  nodes  in  clusters  store  passing  data  after 
authentication but also a central base controller of  each  tier 
also provides back up. The base controller at any particular 
tier  on  retrieval  of  required  data  from  higher  tier  would 
remove  the  upper  level  identifier  and  would  route  it  to  the 

224

conjurer of interest packet, keeping record of the copy to itself 
also.  Tier-III would be the largest including servers of large 
enterprisers. A basic form of first tier based cluster is shown 
below in Fig. 3.

A.  Base Controller 

The use of base controller is pivotal  to the approach as it 
would be required if a particular request/interest is not found 
in  a  particular  tier.  The  memory  size  of  base  controller 
depends on the tier end where it is located e.g. the lowest tier 
would have the small memory and database requirements as 
compared to higher tier base controller. The traffic at any base 
controller can be modeled as 

Based  on  the  popularity  of  content,  the  jth  request 

probability is given by  

 

 

Pj = (1/j)/∑jԑC 1/j                                            (1)

 

Abstract—Since  last  four  decades,  internet  exploration  and 
innovation has touched new horizons but all that advancement 
in  realm  of  internet  was  based  on  peer  to  peer  interaction  or 
mostly  client  server  topology.  There  were  many  loop  holes  in 
such  configuration  as  all  the  communication  was  machine 
identified and all the available resources in the network were not 
fully  utilized,  therefore  a  more  vigorous  content  centric  model 
was proposed and is expanding at a very fast pace in which all 
the data is named and could be searched on the basis of name, 
instead  of  machine  address.  There  are  many  open  challenges 
faced by content centric networks, one is naming of huge amount 
of  data  available  and  efficiently  addressing 
this  data 
dynamically  and  caching  of  huge  information  and  its  fast 
addressing. The other issue of importance is congestion control 
where no host to host based communication is taking place and 
the  nodes  are  searching  and  transferring  required  data  in  an 
independent fashion. The economical solution to the problem of 
global  deployment  of  this  new  technique.  In  our  approach,  we 
have  suggested  and  implemented  a  new  model  that  provides 
remedies  for  current  bottlenecks  in  CCN  by  incorporating  the 
advantages  offered  by  cloud  computing  with  little  overheads. 
We  have  divided  content  centric  networks  in  the  form  of  tiers 
based  on  the  similarity  of  information  that  they  handle  every 
day in close vicinity, the tiers are further divided in to clusters 
whose size and number would be dependent upon the number of 
users.  The  new  approach  has  been  given  the  names  clustered 
CCN or CCCN.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Internet based communication was originally designed for 
host to host or peer to peer with every machine on the internet 
having  unique  identifiers  and  all  the  communication  and 
routing  is  address  based.  Most  of  the  communication  on 
internet  is  client  server  based  e.g.  World  Wide  Web  is 
providing  its  server  based  services  to  most  of  the  internet 
users worldwide to date. 

This scheme is though simple and conventional but has not 
capitalized the full capacity and potential of the network and 
many  of  available  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
especially when they can be easily available locally. A most 
common example is that Alice wants to get a certain MP3 file 
from a remote server or a copy of it may be placed at a local 
CDN, if that is a popular and most visited Server or CDN then 
Alice has to wait for a remotely placed, busy location whereas 
the  same  information  may  have  been  downloaded  by  an 
adjacent machine in the same local network that may be easily

accessible  as  compared  to  the  previous  situation.  Most  of 
internet  today  is  based  on  content  distribution  e.g.  file 
exchange, audio video streaming etc. that are placed usually 
at popular servers  and    is  mostly  dependent  on  the  location 
where the information is currently placed. Though the use of 
CDN’s  has  helped  in  this  regard  but  they  prove  to  be 
expensive and also ensuring their availability is crucial. Also 
security  related 
issues  arise  regarding  content  easily 
misplaced  over  ordinary  unsecure  connections.  Different 
authentication  and  confidentiality  measures  need  to  be 
adopted  on  node  to  node  interaction  level,  whereas  if  data 
itself is authenticated as in named content technique, need for 
authentication  and  formation  of  VPN’s  is  eliminated  and 
more  suitable  and  reliable  security  measure  based  on  data 
itself can be introduced which will be free from hackers and 
intruders intervention. Another issue related to conventional 
IP based network is the restriction of mobility as we bind a 
host  to  its  location  rather  than  by  the  data  it  contains.  As 
current internet tends to adopt to mobility at a very rapid rate 
so the ordinary use of patching devices with their addresses 
(either  IP  addresses  or  MAC  addresses)  results  in  rigorous 
network  forwarding  based  on  the  location  of  information 
where  the  host  is  placed  rather  than  the  information  name 
itself. Name content centric Networking was introduced few 
years back to propose the shape of future networks and rectify 
the  legacies  of  the  current  TCP/IP  based  communication 
model. Instead of IP node the basic entity, named data is the 
central nexus. CCN architecture consists of named data layout, 
caching within the network and transmission dependent on the 
receiver [1]-[3]. First an interest packet is forwarded that may 
contain  the  name  of  particular  data  required  or  a  prefix  of 
named data dependent on whatever convention is used in the 
network  from  a  host  that  want  to  retrieve  some  data.  The 
network  is  equipped  with  intrinsic  cache  systems  that  are 
sometimes embedded with intermediate routers.  The routers 
used  are  specialized  routers  which  search  and  forward  the 
content  based  on  the  content  name.  The  forwarded  interest 
packet would traverse through the network and on finding a 
match  first  authenticates  and  requests  the  remote  node  that 
may be a cache or any other machine containing the data to 
send that data back to the sender that has initiated the interest 
packet. Now the receiver would forward the data packet to the 
sender  that  is  intermediately  stored  by  routers  or  other 
allowed storage machines as it travels back. The data packets 
traverse  the  same  path  as  that  of  interest  packet.  The 
intermediate  storage  is  for  future  use  of  that  particular  data 
from a local location that was recently retrieved. The data is 
stored along with the version and timing in order to update if a 
fresh copy is available. There are three data structures held by 
each CCN node namely content store (CS), pending interest

table  (PIT)  and  forwarding  information  base  (FIB).  The 
request generated called interest for a particular packet is first 
searched in the local content store and if a match is found, it is 
forwarded locally, if a match is not found then it is searched in 
Pending  interest  table  and  if  a  match  is  found,  meaning 
already  a  pending  request  for  same  data  is  there,  then  the 
interface is the PIT is updated so that when the required data 
is found, it would be forwarded to all the pending interfaces. 
If no match is found in PIT then it is forwarded to FIB, for a 
match. If a match is found, a new entry is made in PIT and the 
interest is forwarded. The path of data return is the same as 
that of the interest. Thus the  major  advantages  gain  in  such 
kind of architecture are reduced congestion owing to content 
caching, better delivery speed, basic and simple configuration 
nomenclature for network devices  and  providing  security  at 
data level instead of network devices based [4]. Comparison 
of CCN with conventional TCP/IP stack. ( See Fig. 1).

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  concept  was  introduced  about  a  mere 
decade ago and since then it has seen a tremendous positive 
response  due  to  the  availability  of  virtual  servers  and  open 
source  utilization.  The  offering  of  application  service 
provision at a remote location has led to the introduction of 
almost all sorts of solutions online ranging from hardware to 
software. The remote renting of resources helps especially in 
the  paradigm  of  information  storage  anywhere  without  the 
need  to  actually  buy  hardware  and  its  corresponding 
maintenance and related software update. The three platforms 
generally offered under the umbrella of cloud computing are 
Software  as  Service,  Platform  as  Service,  Infrastructure  as 
service.  This  concept  of  remote  handling  of  provisioned 
resources can prove very helpful in content centric networks 
[7], and in our model we will use the caching of resources via 
cloud in order to reduce cost and effort for installation of new 
hardware  especially  for  base  controllers  in  our  project  that 
would be located at the edge of each tier.

Though  content  centric  networking  offers  a  very  handy 
option for an alternate approach towards our current internet 
services  but  there  are  many  challenges  in  its  effective 
ubiquitous  implementation  [8],  [9].  There  are  four  basic 
problems that we have tried to  rectify in our new approach. 
Those  problems 
cache 
management, and Congestion control and deployment issues. 
There  are  about  more  than  of  the  order  of  105  unique  data 
objects worldwide that needs to be named and a robust and 
efficient  routing  as  well  as  resolution  system  is  required  in 
order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.

would be required if a particular request/interest is not found 
in  a  particular  tier.  The  memory  size  of  base  controller 
depends on the tier end where it is located e.g. the lowest tier

Efficient lookup at the base controller would be possible as 
the requests possibility/probability to the higher level is low 
as  most  interests  would  be  entertained  at  either  the  cluster 
level or lower base controller and so would the look up time 
and  complexity  and  the  higher  tier  edge  base  controllers 
would  have  small  number  of  interest  hits  so  managing  the 
higher  memory  base  controllers  would  be  eased  as  there 
would be less traffic through them.

the form of clusters of nodes in a particular tier and the data 
stored in them is mostly repeated so no need for huge cache 
management for individual devices. Also the introduction of 
one central cache management at base controller can provide 
a huge cache of local files accessed. Use of specific prefix for 
a particular tier helps in fast registering and matching indexes 
even  with  long  sequences  in  cache  search.  The  issue  of 
deployment is solved by introducing cloud computing and the 
services  of  virtual  network  devices  help  to  encompass  the 
location per resources issues. The platform used in this case is 
infrastructure  as  services  of  cloud  computing  that  would 
include  not  only  support  for  heavy  cache  storage  at  base 
controller levels but also the virtual realization of specialized 
named based routers at intermediate tiers.  

B.  Cluster Based Identifier in Naming Prefix 

In case of CCN, longest match of prefix is used for any look 
up. As there is huge number of naming prefixes all over the 
internet so introducing all of them in any particular router FIB 
is not possible so a scaled approach is required. One of  the 
solutions to minimize the memory requirement for a FIB data 
structure is by using Bloom algorithm filter as in [10], yet this 
approach is not sufficient for restriction in the management of 
entries of FIB. In our approach one benefit of cluster based 
routing would be that the number of entries in the FIB would 
be  small  and  introduction  of  multi-hierarchal  structure 
reduces  the  length  of  route.  In  our  approach  a  particular 
cluster would introduce a DNS type route search as shown in 
the Fig. 5 below:

As  can  be  seen,  the  basic  mechanism  of  forwarding  is 
similar  to  the  conventional  CCN  architecture,  with  the  only 
difference that the prefix contains an additional identifier for a 
particular tier which helps in identification of interest being 
generated  by  which  tier  and  its  current  status,  as  the  tiers 
hierarchy is predefined. In case of failure of prefix match in 
CS, PIT, FIB, along with updating the PIT, the interest packet 
would  not  time  out.  The  time  out  mechanism  has  been 
extended in this scheme to the point of final base controller 
which  will  be  lying  at  the  end  of  tier  III  which  will  only 
discard  the  interest  packet.  So,  in  this  project,  the  size  of 
buffers  at  intermediate  routers  is  kept  large.  The  global 
scalability  problem  can  be  reduced  with  fast  routing  by 
dividing  network  in  to  tiers  containing  clusters  of  network 
nodes.  Within  a  particular 
tier,  routing  and  naming 
convention  is  local  so  a  fast  speed  overlook  could  be 
performed. We are currently working on a fast naming based 
routing algorithm for intermediate routers that would further 
suite our topology. The problem of cache management is also 
resolved owing to fact that we have divided our approach in

A  special  identifier  would  be  placed  in  the  hierarchal 
naming prefix in order to cope up with the scalability problem 
with in a particular router FIB. Following would the steps in 
our  route  formation.  In  the  first  phase  any  particular  node 
search  for  adjacent  neighbors  and  then  introduce  the  route 
notification to inform the rest of the nodes about itself and in 
the later phase FIB entries are constructed cluster-wise, that is 
done by aggregating the nodes  that  are  searched  in  the  first 
phase  and  by  using  this  aggregation  the  size  of  entries  in  a 
particular FIB would be significantly reduced. In aggregation 
those  entries  that  have  the  same  route  outgoing  would  be 
combined into a single entry instead. 

C.  Cache Management 

The cache management in CCN can be divided in to main 
categories,  one  is  the  in  network  cache  and  the  other  is  the 
edge cache. In our topology the edge cache would be the base 
controller.  The  in  network  cache  would  refer  to  the  local

Abstract—Since  last  four  decades,  internet  exploration  and 
innovation has touched new horizons but all that advancement 
in  realm  of  internet  was  based  on  peer  to  peer  interaction  or 
mostly  client  server  topology.  There  were  many  loop  holes  in 
such  configuration  as  all  the  communication  was  machine 
identified and all the available resources in the network were not 
fully  utilized,  therefore  a  more  vigorous  content  centric  model 
was proposed and is expanding at a very fast pace in which all 
the data is named and could be searched on the basis of name, 
instead  of  machine  address.  There  are  many  open  challenges 
faced by content centric networks, one is naming of huge amount 
of  data  available  and  efficiently  addressing 
this  data 
dynamically  and  caching  of  huge  information  and  its  fast 
addressing. The other issue of importance is congestion control 
where no host to host based communication is taking place and 
the  nodes  are  searching  and  transferring  required  data  in  an 
independent fashion. The economical solution to the problem of 
global  deployment  of  this  new  technique.  In  our  approach,  we 
have  suggested  and  implemented  a  new  model  that  provides 
remedies  for  current  bottlenecks  in  CCN  by  incorporating  the 
advantages  offered  by  cloud  computing  with  little  overheads. 
We  have  divided  content  centric  networks  in  the  form  of  tiers 
based  on  the  similarity  of  information  that  they  handle  every 
day in close vicinity, the tiers are further divided in to clusters 
whose size and number would be dependent upon the number of 
users.  The  new  approach  has  been  given  the  names  clustered 
CCN or CCCN.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Internet based communication was originally designed for 
host to host or peer to peer with every machine on the internet 
having  unique  identifiers  and  all  the  communication  and 
routing  is  address  based.  Most  of  the  communication  on 
internet  is  client  server  based  e.g.  World  Wide  Web  is 
providing  its  server  based  services  to  most  of  the  internet 
users worldwide to date. 

This scheme is though simple and conventional but has not 
capitalized the full capacity and potential of the network and 
many  of  available  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
especially when they can be easily available locally. A most 
common example is that Alice wants to get a certain MP3 file 
from a remote server or a copy of it may be placed at a local 
CDN, if that is a popular and most visited Server or CDN then 
Alice has to wait for a remotely placed, busy location whereas 
the  same  information  may  have  been  downloaded  by  an 
adjacent machine in the same local network that may be easily

accessible  as  compared  to  the  previous  situation.  Most  of 
internet  today  is  based  on  content  distribution  e.g.  file 
exchange, audio video streaming etc. that are placed usually 
at popular servers  and    is  mostly  dependent  on  the  location 
where the information is currently placed. Though the use of 
CDN’s  has  helped  in  this  regard  but  they  prove  to  be 
expensive and also ensuring their availability is crucial. Also 
security  related 
issues  arise  regarding  content  easily 
misplaced  over  ordinary  unsecure  connections.  Different 
authentication  and  confidentiality  measures  need  to  be 
adopted  on  node  to  node  interaction  level,  whereas  if  data 
itself is authenticated as in named content technique, need for 
authentication  and  formation  of  VPN’s  is  eliminated  and 
more  suitable  and  reliable  security  measure  based  on  data 
itself can be introduced which will be free from hackers and 
intruders intervention. Another issue related to conventional 
IP based network is the restriction of mobility as we bind a 
host  to  its  location  rather  than  by  the  data  it  contains.  As 
current internet tends to adopt to mobility at a very rapid rate 
so the ordinary use of patching devices with their addresses 
(either  IP  addresses  or  MAC  addresses)  results  in  rigorous 
network  forwarding  based  on  the  location  of  information 
where  the  host  is  placed  rather  than  the  information  name 
itself. Name content centric Networking was introduced few 
years back to propose the shape of future networks and rectify 
the  legacies  of  the  current  TCP/IP  based  communication 
model. Instead of IP node the basic entity, named data is the 
central nexus. CCN architecture consists of named data layout, 
caching within the network and transmission dependent on the 
receiver [1]-[3]. First an interest packet is forwarded that may 
contain  the  name  of  particular  data  required  or  a  prefix  of 
named data dependent on whatever convention is used in the 
network  from  a  host  that  want  to  retrieve  some  data.  The 
network  is  equipped  with  intrinsic  cache  systems  that  are 
sometimes embedded with intermediate routers.  The routers 
used  are  specialized  routers  which  search  and  forward  the 
content  based  on  the  content  name.  The  forwarded  interest 
packet would traverse through the network and on finding a 
match  first  authenticates  and  requests  the  remote  node  that 
may be a cache or any other machine containing the data to 
send that data back to the sender that has initiated the interest 
packet. Now the receiver would forward the data packet to the 
sender  that  is  intermediately  stored  by  routers  or  other 
allowed storage machines as it travels back. The data packets 
traverse  the  same  path  as  that  of  interest  packet.  The 
intermediate  storage  is  for  future  use  of  that  particular  data 
from a local location that was recently retrieved. The data is 
stored along with the version and timing in order to update if a 
fresh copy is available. There are three data structures held by 
each CCN node namely content store (CS), pending interest

table  (PIT)  and  forwarding  information  base  (FIB).  The 
request generated called interest for a particular packet is first 
searched in the local content store and if a match is found, it is 
forwarded locally, if a match is not found then it is searched in 
Pending  interest  table  and  if  a  match  is  found,  meaning 
already  a  pending  request  for  same  data  is  there,  then  the 
interface is the PIT is updated so that when the required data 
is found, it would be forwarded to all the pending interfaces. 
If no match is found in PIT then it is forwarded to FIB, for a 
match. If a match is found, a new entry is made in PIT and the 
interest is forwarded. The path of data return is the same as 
that of the interest. Thus the  major  advantages  gain  in  such 
kind of architecture are reduced congestion owing to content 
caching, better delivery speed, basic and simple configuration 
nomenclature for network devices  and  providing  security  at 
data level instead of network devices based [4]. Comparison 
of CCN with conventional TCP/IP stack. ( See Fig. 1).

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  concept  was  introduced  about  a  mere 
decade ago and since then it has seen a tremendous positive 
response  due  to  the  availability  of  virtual  servers  and  open 
source  utilization.  The  offering  of  application  service 
provision at a remote location has led to the introduction of 
almost all sorts of solutions online ranging from hardware to 
software. The remote renting of resources helps especially in 
the  paradigm  of  information  storage  anywhere  without  the 
need  to  actually  buy  hardware  and  its  corresponding 
maintenance and related software update. The three platforms 
generally offered under the umbrella of cloud computing are 
Software  as  Service,  Platform  as  Service,  Infrastructure  as 
service.  This  concept  of  remote  handling  of  provisioned 
resources can prove very helpful in content centric networks 
[7], and in our model we will use the caching of resources via 
cloud in order to reduce cost and effort for installation of new 
hardware  especially  for  base  controllers  in  our  project  that 
would be located at the edge of each tier.

include  global 

Though  content  centric  networking  offers  a  very  handy 
option for an alternate approach towards our current internet 
services  but  there  are  many  challenges  in  its  effective 
ubiquitous  implementation  [8],  [9].  There  are  four  basic 
problems that we have tried to  rectify in our new approach. 
Those  problems 
cache 
management, and Congestion control and deployment issues. 
There  are  about  more  than  of  the  order  of  105  unique  data 
objects worldwide that needs to be named and a robust and 
efficient  routing  as  well  as  resolution  system  is  required  in 
order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.  

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  basic  methodology  of  project  is  to  divide  the  global 
access into multiple tiers and clusters and the new technique is 
given  the  name  Clustered  CCN,  those  tiers  are  not  the 
conventional tiers as we interpret in terms of internet service 
providers.  These  tiers  are  formed  on  the  basis  of  level  and 
type of data that is generated in particular vicinity. Those tiers 
may  be  formed  by  users  independent  of  ISP’s,  by  simply 
joining based on the type of information they require mostly. 
But we have divided for simplicity our CCCN into three tiers.

Increased  granularity  at  base  level  would  ensure  better 
handling  of  named  contents.  Numerous  clusters  would  be 
formed within a particular tier based on the number of users 
and connections in the near vicinity. At the edge of each tier, a 
base controller is introduced that would be similar to a CDN. 
Each  tier  would  have  a  special  search  preference  within  it 
before passing through base controller for search of data into 
another  tier.  A  particular  tier  form  a  type  of  Adhoc 
configuration  with  the  advantage  of  fast  searching  and 
matching  as  special  identifiers  are  appended  along  with  the 
name prefix. 

Tier-I consist of ordinary customers, that are either mobile 
or  immobile  or  Adhoc  based.  In  Tier-I  There  could  be 
multiple clusters but for simplicity we have considered only 
one cluster per tier. The advantage of cluster is that with in a 
tier,  data  is  first  searched  in  the  current  cluster  and  then 
adjoining  clusters  of  a  particular  tier.  For  a  CCN  interest 
request  generated  by  any  of  the  hosts  with  in  a  cluster,  it 
would first be routed within that particular cluster of that tier. 
The  routing  scheme  for  each  tier  would  be  different.  If 
nothing found in the first tier of cluster of machines, it would 
be forwarded to next tier through a base controller that would 
be  monitoring  the  requests  flow  and  data  between  adjacent 
tiers. This approach would be similar to Tier based cluster of 
Adhoc nodes with the only exception that once an interest is 
not  successful  in  a  particular  tier,  it  would  be  routed  via  a 
central  Base  Controller  of  that  particular  tier  that  would 
update  its  information  after  every  successful  data  retrieval 
from the other tier. In our topology we have supposed that ISP 
has  no  restriction  on  the  storage  of  data  in  any  particular 
device  or  networking  node.  In  a  particular  tier,  the  data 
naming would be local and would be differentiated from the 
other  tier  by  means  of  identifier  in  each  particular  tier  that 
would be unique, though the name of data would be the same 
but  only  the  addressing  and  routing  convention  would  be 
simplified  by  appending  a  particular  identifier  with  the 
naming  prefix  in  the  order  of  hierarchical  name  that  can 
simplify  the  search  for  similar  data  routes  and  would  be 
included  in  the  scope  area  of  the  interest  packet.  This 
technique can ensure a fast data routing based on the prefix 
identifier  of  that  particular  tier.  When  a  particular  tier  is 
unsuccessful in retrieving data, the timer would  live  on  and 
would  be  readjusted  at  the  base  controller  along  with 
appending new prefix identifier for the next tier and removing 
the  previous  identifier.    The  same  cycle  is  repeated  for  the 
second and third tier. The second tier would be a broad based 
tier whose cluster would cover up to a particular country level. 
When  the  interest  request  arrives  in  tier-II,  it  would  be 
processed in the same fashion and if the data is not found in 
tier-II  then  it  would  be  forwarded  to  tier-III  by  passing 
through  another  base  controller.  The  introduction  of  base 
controller ensures that even if a device that may have the copy 
of information is not active then ultimately based controller 
can provide the data, if it was previously requested via it as it 
updates  its  database  on  each  request  through  it,  so  in  this 
fashion  not  only  nodes  in  clusters  store  passing  data  after 
authentication but also a central base controller of  each  tier 
also provides back up. The base controller at any particular 
tier  on  retrieval  of  required  data  from  higher  tier  would 
remove  the  upper  level  identifier  and  would  route  it  to  the 

224

conjurer of interest packet, keeping record of the copy to itself 
also.  Tier-III would be the largest including servers of large 
enterprisers. A basic form of first tier based cluster is shown 
below in Fig. 3.

A.  Base Controller 

The use of base controller is pivotal  to the approach as it 
would be required if a particular request/interest is not found 
in  a  particular  tier.  The  memory  size  of  base  controller 
depends on the tier end where it is located e.g. the lowest tier 
would have the small memory and database requirements as 
compared to higher tier base controller. The traffic at any base 
controller can be modeled as 

Based  on  the  popularity  of  content,  the  jth  request 

probability is given by  

 

 

Pj = (1/j)/∑jԑC 1/j                                            (1) 

where C is the content requested, Pj is the probability of that 
content.

Efficient lookup at the base controller would be possible as 
the requests possibility/probability to the higher level is low 
as  most  interests  would  be  entertained  at  either  the  cluster 
level or lower base controller and so would the look up time 
and  complexity  and  the  higher  tier  edge  base  controllers 
would  have  small  number  of  interest  hits  so  managing  the 
higher  memory  base  controllers  would  be  eased  as  there 
would be less traffic through them.

the form of clusters of nodes in a particular tier and the data 
stored in them is mostly repeated so no need for huge cache 
management for individual devices. Also the introduction of 
one central cache management at base controller can provide 
a huge cache of local files accessed. Use of specific prefix for 
a particular tier helps in fast registering and matching indexes 
even  with  long  sequences  in  cache  search.  The  issue  of 
deployment is solved by introducing cloud computing and the 
services  of  virtual  network  devices  help  to  encompass  the 
location per resources issues. The platform used in this case is 
infrastructure  as  services  of  cloud  computing  that  would 
include  not  only  support  for  heavy  cache  storage  at  base 
controller levels but also the virtual realization of specialized 
named based routers at intermediate tiers.  

B.  Cluster Based Identifier in Naming Prefix 

In case of CCN, longest match of prefix is used for any look 
up. As there is huge number of naming prefixes all over the 
internet so introducing all of them in any particular router FIB 
is not possible so a scaled approach is required. One of  the 
solutions to minimize the memory requirement for a FIB data 
structure is by using Bloom algorithm filter as in [10], yet this 
approach is not sufficient for restriction in the management of 
entries of FIB. In our approach one benefit of cluster based 
routing would be that the number of entries in the FIB would 
be  small  and  introduction  of  multi-hierarchal  structure 
reduces  the  length  of  route.  In  our  approach  a  particular 
cluster would introduce a DNS type route search as shown in 
the Fig. 5 below:

As  can  be  seen,  the  basic  mechanism  of  forwarding  is 
similar  to  the  conventional  CCN  architecture,  with  the  only 
difference that the prefix contains an additional identifier for a 
particular tier which helps in identification of interest being 
generated  by  which  tier  and  its  current  status,  as  the  tiers 
hierarchy is predefined. In case of failure of prefix match in 
CS, PIT, FIB, along with updating the PIT, the interest packet 
would  not  time  out.  The  time  out  mechanism  has  been 
extended in this scheme to the point of final base controller 
which  will  be  lying  at  the  end  of  tier  III  which  will  only 
discard  the  interest  packet.  So,  in  this  project,  the  size  of 
buffers  at  intermediate  routers  is  kept  large.  The  global 
scalability  problem  can  be  reduced  with  fast  routing  by 
dividing  network  in  to  tiers  containing  clusters  of  network 
nodes.  Within  a  particular 
tier,  routing  and  naming 
convention  is  local  so  a  fast  speed  overlook  could  be 
performed. We are currently working on a fast naming based 
routing algorithm for intermediate routers that would further 
suite our topology. The problem of cache management is also 
resolved owing to fact that we have divided our approach in 

225

Fig. 5. DNS based route search. 

 
A  special  identifier  would  be  placed  in  the  hierarchal 
naming prefix in order to cope up with the scalability problem 
with in a particular router FIB. Following would the steps in 
our  route  formation.  In  the  first  phase  any  particular  node 
search  for  adjacent  neighbors  and  then  introduce  the  route 
notification to inform the rest of the nodes about itself and in 
the later phase FIB entries are constructed cluster-wise, that is 
done by aggregating the nodes  that  are  searched  in  the  first 
phase  and  by  using  this  aggregation  the  size  of  entries  in  a 
particular FIB would be significantly reduced. In aggregation 
those  entries  that  have  the  same  route  outgoing  would  be 
combined into a single entry instead. 

C.  Cache Management 

The cache management in CCN can be divided in to main 
categories,  one  is  the  in  network  cache  and  the  other  is  the 
edge cache. In our topology the edge cache would be the base 
controller.  The  in  network  cache  would  refer  to  the  local

cache  at  the  router.  The  information/content  objects  are 
arranged in the form of binary search tree. The content store at 
any  router  in  a  particular  cluster  would  contain  a  packet 
storage that is indexed to accelerate to process of matching. In 
order  to  keep  in  view  the  requirement  of  popular  content 
demand,  the  indexing  is  modified  with  the  inclusion  of  a 
popularity counter index that would increase with the number 
of recent hits and would have the high priority in search. This 
approach can result in low access time due to small coverage 
and inclusion of popularity index. The insertion/update, look 
up and deletion of content is governed by binary search tree 
algorithm.  Within  cache  the  content  objects  are  stored  and 
replaced  in  accordance  with  the  policies  of  both  Least 
Recently  Used  (LRU)  and  Least  Frequency  Used  (LFU) 
discussed in [11]. 

D.  Congestion Control 

time  out 

In case of content centric networks, simple transport layer 
protocols that have the tendency to cope up with the problem 
of congestion cannot be introduced as the data/content object 
can  be  retrieved  from  multiple  sources  and  there  is  no 
particular RTT that could be defined and time outs cannot be 
defined discretely. In [12], [13] the retransmission timer for 
interest  is  calculated  from  the  previous  data  objects  as 
samples,  whereas  in  case  of  [14]  for  each  data  source  a 
particular 
is  maintained  but  the  underlying 
assumption that the receiver knows the location of every data 
source  even  before  the  transfer  and  there  is  no  change  of 
location  during  the  transfer  that  is  not  possible  as  the  CCN 
requests  could  be  fulfilled  by  multiple  sources.  The 
introduction of cluster based traffic increases the probability 
of single time out value as the caches would be close to each 
other. Other factors that reduce congestion in our topology are 
effective  cache  management,  reduced  traffic  in  a  particular 
cluster. This topology performs well for congestion cases that 
are originated mostly from single source. For the case where 
the  traffic  is  originated  from  multiple  sources,  content 
collection  from  multiple  sources  is  taken  into  account  and 
would  require  a  premature  or  future  anticipated  interest 
packet  calculation  and  calculating  individual  timeouts  from 
each particular source. 

E.  Router Dynamics 

In conventional routers there are two memory architectures 
namely  multicasting  and  multi-matching.  In  multicasting 
there is forward information base, multicast expansion table 
and adjacency table. Forwarding information table holds the 
address  of  source  and  information  of  multicast  ring. 
Adjacency  table  has  the  rewrite  multicast  expansion  table 
index  and  MAC  those  are  memory  types  and  have  a  finite 
capacity. In case of multi-matching, the destination address is 
compared  with  the  forwarding  entry  in  the  table  and  the 
longest  match  is  the  resultant  prefix  match.  The  forwarding 
table  memory  is  composed  of  special  ternary  content 
addressable  memory  (TCAM)  that  is  used  for  high  speed 
search  and  the  resultant  search  is  returned  to  SRAM  by 
priority  encoders. 
routers, 
multicasting  is  done  by  a  match  of  TCAM  entry  with  the 
desired address output and the resultant interface is stored in 
multicast  expansion  table.  In  our  topology  we  have  used 

In  case  of  conventional

active TCAM and passive SRAM which can ensure a parallel 
and high speed search. 

F.  Delay Analysis 

In  our  technique,  introduction  of  tier  based  clustering 
reduces the delay time td because the hit probability of getting 
the  same  information  within  a  particular  tier  is  higher.  The 
second factor is the size of local caches is reduced. Thirdly the 
introduction  of  base  controller  would  ensure  a  swift  data 
retrieval  if  any  such  copy  has  been  passed  before  from  the 
upper 
the  parameters  for  delay 
calculations.

In  our  technique,  the  value  of  Td  would  decrease  as  the 
value  of  the  denominator  in  the  above  equation  would 
increase,  owing  to  the  fact  of  better  cache  hits  and 
improvement in the content arrival rates.

The number of hops would be reduced in a particular tier as 
the tiers are based on similarity of information and so would 
be the probability of lesser number of hops and greater chance 
of successful hit after lesser number of hops. 

 

V.  SIMULATIONS 

Two test beds were set up with different scenarios to check 
the performance of our new CCN topology as compared to the 
ordinary  CCN  in  OPNET  with  packet  level  CCN  simulator 
implemented  at  the  top  of  TCP/IP  in  network  nodes.  The 
scenario is depicted in Fig. 6. Different file objects of types 
jpeg,  doc,  mp3  are  retrieved  and  their  performance  is 
measured with the following graphs. The simulation scenario 
consists  of  hybrid  wired  and  wireless  networks  forming 
clusters.  For  simplicity,  only  three  clusters  are  considered 
with only a single base controller at the edge.

A New Tier Based Approach for Clustered Content Centric 

Networks Implementing Cloud Computing 

W. A. Gulzar, M. U. J. A Sundhu, and A. R. Butt 

 

 

Abstract—Since  last  four  decades,  internet  exploration  and 
innovation has touched new horizons but all that advancement 
in  realm  of  internet  was  based  on  peer  to  peer  interaction  or 
mostly  client  server  topology.  There  were  many  loop  holes  in 
such  configuration  as  all  the  communication  was  machine 
identified and all the available resources in the network were not 
fully  utilized,  therefore  a  more  vigorous  content  centric  model 
was proposed and is expanding at a very fast pace in which all 
the data is named and could be searched on the basis of name, 
instead  of  machine  address.  There  are  many  open  challenges 
faced by content centric networks, one is naming of huge amount 
of  data  available  and  efficiently  addressing 
this  data 
dynamically  and  caching  of  huge  information  and  its  fast 
addressing. The other issue of importance is congestion control 
where no host to host based communication is taking place and 
the  nodes  are  searching  and  transferring  required  data  in  an 
independent fashion. The economical solution to the problem of 
global  deployment  of  this  new  technique.  In  our  approach,  we 
have  suggested  and  implemented  a  new  model  that  provides 
remedies  for  current  bottlenecks  in  CCN  by  incorporating  the 
advantages  offered  by  cloud  computing  with  little  overheads. 
We  have  divided  content  centric  networks  in  the  form  of  tiers 
based  on  the  similarity  of  information  that  they  handle  every 
day in close vicinity, the tiers are further divided in to clusters 
whose size and number would be dependent upon the number of 
users.  The  new  approach  has  been  given  the  names  clustered 
CCN or CCCN.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Internet based communication was originally designed for 
host to host or peer to peer with every machine on the internet 
having  unique  identifiers  and  all  the  communication  and 
routing  is  address  based.  Most  of  the  communication  on 
internet  is  client  server  based  e.g.  World  Wide  Web  is 
providing  its  server  based  services  to  most  of  the  internet 
users worldwide to date. 

This scheme is though simple and conventional but has not 
capitalized the full capacity and potential of the network and 
many  of  available  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
especially when they can be easily available locally. A most 
common example is that Alice wants to get a certain MP3 file 
from a remote server or a copy of it may be placed at a local 
CDN, if that is a popular and most visited Server or CDN then 
Alice has to wait for a remotely placed, busy location whereas 
the  same  information  may  have  been  downloaded  by  an 
adjacent machine in the same local network that may be easily

accessible  as  compared  to  the  previous  situation.  Most  of 
internet  today  is  based  on  content  distribution  e.g.  file 
exchange, audio video streaming etc. that are placed usually 
at popular servers  and    is  mostly  dependent  on  the  location 
where the information is currently placed. Though the use of 
CDN’s  has  helped  in  this  regard  but  they  prove  to  be 
expensive and also ensuring their availability is crucial. Also 
security  related 
issues  arise  regarding  content  easily 
misplaced  over  ordinary  unsecure  connections.  Different 
authentication  and  confidentiality  measures  need  to  be 
adopted  on  node  to  node  interaction  level,  whereas  if  data 
itself is authenticated as in named content technique, need for 
authentication  and  formation  of  VPN’s  is  eliminated  and 
more  suitable  and  reliable  security  measure  based  on  data 
itself can be introduced which will be free from hackers and 
intruders intervention. Another issue related to conventional 
IP based network is the restriction of mobility as we bind a 
host  to  its  location  rather  than  by  the  data  it  contains.  As 
current internet tends to adopt to mobility at a very rapid rate 
so the ordinary use of patching devices with their addresses 
(either  IP  addresses  or  MAC  addresses)  results  in  rigorous 
network  forwarding  based  on  the  location  of  information 
where  the  host  is  placed  rather  than  the  information  name 
itself. Name content centric Networking was introduced few 
years back to propose the shape of future networks and rectify 
the  legacies  of  the  current  TCP/IP  based  communication 
model. Instead of IP node the basic entity, named data is the 
central nexus. CCN architecture consists of named data layout, 
caching within the network and transmission dependent on the 
receiver [1]-[3]. First an interest packet is forwarded that may 
contain  the  name  of  particular  data  required  or  a  prefix  of 
named data dependent on whatever convention is used in the 
network  from  a  host  that  want  to  retrieve  some  data.  The 
network  is  equipped  with  intrinsic  cache  systems  that  are 
sometimes embedded with intermediate routers.  The routers 
used  are  specialized  routers  which  search  and  forward  the 
content  based  on  the  content  name.  The  forwarded  interest 
packet would traverse through the network and on finding a 
match  first  authenticates  and  requests  the  remote  node  that 
may be a cache or any other machine containing the data to 
send that data back to the sender that has initiated the interest 
packet. Now the receiver would forward the data packet to the 
sender  that  is  intermediately  stored  by  routers  or  other 
allowed storage machines as it travels back. The data packets 
traverse  the  same  path  as  that  of  interest  packet.  The 
intermediate  storage  is  for  future  use  of  that  particular  data 
from a local location that was recently retrieved. The data is 
stored along with the version and timing in order to update if a 
fresh copy is available. There are three data structures held by 
each CCN node namely content store (CS), pending interest

table  (PIT)  and  forwarding  information  base  (FIB).  The 
request generated called interest for a particular packet is first 
searched in the local content store and if a match is found, it is 
forwarded locally, if a match is not found then it is searched in 
Pending  interest  table  and  if  a  match  is  found,  meaning 
already  a  pending  request  for  same  data  is  there,  then  the 
interface is the PIT is updated so that when the required data 
is found, it would be forwarded to all the pending interfaces. 
If no match is found in PIT then it is forwarded to FIB, for a 
match. If a match is found, a new entry is made in PIT and the 
interest is forwarded. The path of data return is the same as 
that of the interest. Thus the  major  advantages  gain  in  such 
kind of architecture are reduced congestion owing to content 
caching, better delivery speed, basic and simple configuration 
nomenclature for network devices  and  providing  security  at 
data level instead of network devices based [4]. Comparison 
of CCN with conventional TCP/IP stack. ( See Fig. 1).

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  concept  was  introduced  about  a  mere 
decade ago and since then it has seen a tremendous positive 
response  due  to  the  availability  of  virtual  servers  and  open 
source  utilization.  The  offering  of  application  service 
provision at a remote location has led to the introduction of 
almost all sorts of solutions online ranging from hardware to 
software. The remote renting of resources helps especially in 
the  paradigm  of  information  storage  anywhere  without  the 
need  to  actually  buy  hardware  and  its  corresponding 
maintenance and related software update. The three platforms 
generally offered under the umbrella of cloud computing are 
Software  as  Service,  Platform  as  Service,  Infrastructure  as 
service.  This  concept  of  remote  handling  of  provisioned 
resources can prove very helpful in content centric networks 
[7], and in our model we will use the caching of resources via 
cloud in order to reduce cost and effort for installation of new 
hardware  especially  for  base  controllers  in  our  project  that 
would be located at the edge of each tier.

scalability, 

include  global 

Though  content  centric  networking  offers  a  very  handy 
option for an alternate approach towards our current internet 
services  but  there  are  many  challenges  in  its  effective 
ubiquitous  implementation  [8],  [9].  There  are  four  basic 
problems that we have tried to  rectify in our new approach. 
Those  problems 
cache 
management, and Congestion control and deployment issues. 
There  are  about  more  than  of  the  order  of  105  unique  data 
objects worldwide that needs to be named and a robust and 
efficient  routing  as  well  as  resolution  system  is  required  in 
order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.  

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  basic  methodology  of  project  is  to  divide  the  global 
access into multiple tiers and clusters and the new technique is 
given  the  name  Clustered  CCN,  those  tiers  are  not  the 
conventional tiers as we interpret in terms of internet service 
providers.  These  tiers  are  formed  on  the  basis  of  level  and 
type of data that is generated in particular vicinity. Those tiers 
may  be  formed  by  users  independent  of  ISP’s,  by  simply 
joining based on the type of information they require mostly. 
But we have divided for simplicity our CCCN into three tiers.

Increased  granularity  at  base  level  would  ensure  better 
handling  of  named  contents.  Numerous  clusters  would  be 
formed within a particular tier based on the number of users 
and connections in the near vicinity. At the edge of each tier, a 
base controller is introduced that would be similar to a CDN. 
Each  tier  would  have  a  special  search  preference  within  it 
before passing through base controller for search of data into 
another  tier.  A  particular  tier  form  a  type  of  Adhoc 
configuration  with  the  advantage  of  fast  searching  and 
matching  as  special  identifiers  are  appended  along  with  the 
name prefix. 

Tier-I consist of ordinary customers, that are either mobile 
or  immobile  or  Adhoc  based.  In  Tier-I  There  could  be 
multiple clusters but for simplicity we have considered only 
one cluster per tier. The advantage of cluster is that with in a 
tier,  data  is  first  searched  in  the  current  cluster  and  then 
adjoining  clusters  of  a  particular  tier.  For  a  CCN  interest 
request  generated  by  any  of  the  hosts  with  in  a  cluster,  it 
would first be routed within that particular cluster of that tier. 
The  routing  scheme  for  each  tier  would  be  different.  If 
nothing found in the first tier of cluster of machines, it would 
be forwarded to next tier through a base controller that would 
be  monitoring  the  requests  flow  and  data  between  adjacent 
tiers. This approach would be similar to Tier based cluster of 
Adhoc nodes with the only exception that once an interest is 
not  successful  in  a  particular  tier,  it  would  be  routed  via  a 
central  Base  Controller  of  that  particular  tier  that  would 
update  its  information  after  every  successful  data  retrieval 
from the other tier. In our topology we have supposed that ISP 
has  no  restriction  on  the  storage  of  data  in  any  particular 
device  or  networking  node.  In  a  particular  tier,  the  data 
naming would be local and would be differentiated from the 
other  tier  by  means  of  identifier  in  each  particular  tier  that 
would be unique, though the name of data would be the same 
but  only  the  addressing  and  routing  convention  would  be 
simplified  by  appending  a  particular  identifier  with  the 
naming  prefix  in  the  order  of  hierarchical  name  that  can 
simplify  the  search  for  similar  data  routes  and  would  be 
included  in  the  scope  area  of  the  interest  packet.  This 
technique can ensure a fast data routing based on the prefix 
identifier  of  that  particular  tier.  When  a  particular  tier  is 
unsuccessful in retrieving data, the timer would  live  on  and 
would  be  readjusted  at  the  base  controller  along  with 
appending new prefix identifier for the next tier and removing 
the  previous  identifier.    The  same  cycle  is  repeated  for  the 
second and third tier. The second tier would be a broad based 
tier whose cluster would cover up to a particular country level. 
When  the  interest  request  arrives  in  tier-II,  it  would  be 
processed in the same fashion and if the data is not found in 
tier-II  then  it  would  be  forwarded  to  tier-III  by  passing 
through  another  base  controller.  The  introduction  of  base 
controller ensures that even if a device that may have the copy 
of information is not active then ultimately based controller 
can provide the data, if it was previously requested via it as it 
updates  its  database  on  each  request  through  it,  so  in  this 
fashion  not  only  nodes  in  clusters  store  passing  data  after 
authentication but also a central base controller of  each  tier 
also provides back up. The base controller at any particular 
tier  on  retrieval  of  required  data  from  higher  tier  would 
remove  the  upper  level  identifier  and  would  route  it  to  the 

224

conjurer of interest packet, keeping record of the copy to itself 
also.  Tier-III would be the largest including servers of large 
enterprisers. A basic form of first tier based cluster is shown 
below in Fig. 3.

A.  Base Controller 

The use of base controller is pivotal  to the approach as it 
would be required if a particular request/interest is not found 
in  a  particular  tier.  The  memory  size  of  base  controller 
depends on the tier end where it is located e.g. the lowest tier 
would have the small memory and database requirements as 
compared to higher tier base controller. The traffic at any base 
controller can be modeled as 

Based  on  the  popularity  of  content,  the  jth  request 

probability is given by  

 

 

Pj = (1/j)/∑jԑC 1/j                                            (1) 

where C is the content requested, Pj is the probability of that 
content.

Efficient lookup at the base controller would be possible as 
the requests possibility/probability to the higher level is low 
as  most  interests  would  be  entertained  at  either  the  cluster 
level or lower base controller and so would the look up time 
and  complexity  and  the  higher  tier  edge  base  controllers 
would  have  small  number  of  interest  hits  so  managing  the 
higher  memory  base  controllers  would  be  eased  as  there 
would be less traffic through them.

the form of clusters of nodes in a particular tier and the data 
stored in them is mostly repeated so no need for huge cache 
management for individual devices. Also the introduction of 
one central cache management at base controller can provide 
a huge cache of local files accessed. Use of specific prefix for 
a particular tier helps in fast registering and matching indexes 
even  with  long  sequences  in  cache  search.  The  issue  of 
deployment is solved by introducing cloud computing and the 
services  of  virtual  network  devices  help  to  encompass  the 
location per resources issues. The platform used in this case is 
infrastructure  as  services  of  cloud  computing  that  would 
include  not  only  support  for  heavy  cache  storage  at  base 
controller levels but also the virtual realization of specialized 
named based routers at intermediate tiers.  

B.  Cluster Based Identifier in Naming Prefix 

In case of CCN, longest match of prefix is used for any look 
up. As there is huge number of naming prefixes all over the 
internet so introducing all of them in any particular router FIB 
is not possible so a scaled approach is required. One of  the 
solutions to minimize the memory requirement for a FIB data 
structure is by using Bloom algorithm filter as in [10], yet this 
approach is not sufficient for restriction in the management of 
entries of FIB. In our approach one benefit of cluster based 
routing would be that the number of entries in the FIB would 
be  small  and  introduction  of  multi-hierarchal  structure 
reduces  the  length  of  route.  In  our  approach  a  particular 
cluster would introduce a DNS type route search as shown in 
the Fig. 5 below:

As  can  be  seen,  the  basic  mechanism  of  forwarding  is 
similar  to  the  conventional  CCN  architecture,  with  the  only 
difference that the prefix contains an additional identifier for a 
particular tier which helps in identification of interest being 
generated  by  which  tier  and  its  current  status,  as  the  tiers 
hierarchy is predefined. In case of failure of prefix match in 
CS, PIT, FIB, along with updating the PIT, the interest packet 
would  not  time  out.  The  time  out  mechanism  has  been 
extended in this scheme to the point of final base controller 
which  will  be  lying  at  the  end  of  tier  III  which  will  only 
discard  the  interest  packet.  So,  in  this  project,  the  size  of 
buffers  at  intermediate  routers  is  kept  large.  The  global 
scalability  problem  can  be  reduced  with  fast  routing  by 
dividing  network  in  to  tiers  containing  clusters  of  network 
nodes.  Within  a  particular 
tier,  routing  and  naming 
convention  is  local  so  a  fast  speed  overlook  could  be 
performed. We are currently working on a fast naming based 
routing algorithm for intermediate routers that would further 
suite our topology. The problem of cache management is also 
resolved owing to fact that we have divided our approach in

A  special  identifier  would  be  placed  in  the  hierarchal 
naming prefix in order to cope up with the scalability problem 
with in a particular router FIB. Following would the steps in 
our  route  formation.  In  the  first  phase  any  particular  node 
search  for  adjacent  neighbors  and  then  introduce  the  route 
notification to inform the rest of the nodes about itself and in 
the later phase FIB entries are constructed cluster-wise, that is 
done by aggregating the nodes  that  are  searched  in  the  first 
phase  and  by  using  this  aggregation  the  size  of  entries  in  a 
particular FIB would be significantly reduced. In aggregation 
those  entries  that  have  the  same  route  outgoing  would  be 
combined into a single entry instead. 

C.  Cache Management 

The cache management in CCN can be divided in to main 
categories,  one  is  the  in  network  cache  and  the  other  is  the 
edge cache. In our topology the edge cache would be the base 
controller.  The  in  network  cache  would  refer  to  the  local 

 

Journal of Advances in Computer Networks, Vol. 2, No. 3, September 2014

 

cache  at  the  router.  The  information/content  objects  are 
arranged in the form of binary search tree. The content store at 
any  router  in  a  particular  cluster  would  contain  a  packet 
storage that is indexed to accelerate to process of matching. In 
order  to  keep  in  view  the  requirement  of  popular  content 
demand,  the  indexing  is  modified  with  the  inclusion  of  a 
popularity counter index that would increase with the number 
of recent hits and would have the high priority in search. This 
approach can result in low access time due to small coverage 
and inclusion of popularity index. The insertion/update, look 
up and deletion of content is governed by binary search tree 
algorithm.  Within  cache  the  content  objects  are  stored  and 
replaced  in  accordance  with  the  policies  of  both  Least 
Recently  Used  (LRU)  and  Least  Frequency  Used  (LFU) 
discussed in [11]. 

D.  Congestion Control 

time  out 

In case of content centric networks, simple transport layer 
protocols that have the tendency to cope up with the problem 
of congestion cannot be introduced as the data/content object 
can  be  retrieved  from  multiple  sources  and  there  is  no 
particular RTT that could be defined and time outs cannot be 
defined discretely. In [12], [13] the retransmission timer for 
interest  is  calculated  from  the  previous  data  objects  as 
samples,  whereas  in  case  of  [14]  for  each  data  source  a 
particular 
is  maintained  but  the  underlying 
assumption that the receiver knows the location of every data 
source  even  before  the  transfer  and  there  is  no  change  of 
location  during  the  transfer  that  is  not  possible  as  the  CCN 
requests  could  be  fulfilled  by  multiple  sources.  The 
introduction of cluster based traffic increases the probability 
of single time out value as the caches would be close to each 
other. Other factors that reduce congestion in our topology are 
effective  cache  management,  reduced  traffic  in  a  particular 
cluster. This topology performs well for congestion cases that 
are originated mostly from single source. For the case where 
the  traffic  is  originated  from  multiple  sources,  content 
collection  from  multiple  sources  is  taken  into  account  and 
would  require  a  premature  or  future  anticipated  interest 
packet  calculation  and  calculating  individual  timeouts  from 
each particular source. 

E.  Router Dynamics 

In conventional routers there are two memory architectures 
namely  multicasting  and  multi-matching.  In  multicasting 
there is forward information base, multicast expansion table 
and adjacency table. Forwarding information table holds the 
address  of  source  and  information  of  multicast  ring. 
Adjacency  table  has  the  rewrite  multicast  expansion  table 
index  and  MAC  those  are  memory  types  and  have  a  finite 
capacity. In case of multi-matching, the destination address is 
compared  with  the  forwarding  entry  in  the  table  and  the 
longest  match  is  the  resultant  prefix  match.  The  forwarding 
table  memory  is  composed  of  special  ternary  content 
addressable  memory  (TCAM)  that  is  used  for  high  speed 
search  and  the  resultant  search  is  returned  to  SRAM  by 
priority  encoders. 
routers, 
multicasting  is  done  by  a  match  of  TCAM  entry  with  the 
desired address output and the resultant interface is stored in 
multicast  expansion  table.  In  our  topology  we  have  used

active TCAM and passive SRAM which can ensure a parallel 
and high speed search. 

F.  Delay Analysis 

In  our  technique,  introduction  of  tier  based  clustering 
reduces the delay time td because the hit probability of getting 
the  same  information  within  a  particular  tier  is  higher.  The 
second factor is the size of local caches is reduced. Thirdly the 
introduction  of  base  controller  would  ensure  a  swift  data 
retrieval  if  any  such  copy  has  been  passed  before  from  the 
upper 
the  parameters  for  delay 
calculations.

In  our  technique,  the  value  of  Td  would  decrease  as  the 
value  of  the  denominator  in  the  above  equation  would 
increase,  owing  to  the  fact  of  better  cache  hits  and 
improvement in the content arrival rates.

The number of hops would be reduced in a particular tier as 
the tiers are based on similarity of information and so would 
be the probability of lesser number of hops and greater chance 
of successful hit after lesser number of hops. 

 

V.  SIMULATIONS 

Two test beds were set up with different scenarios to check 
the performance of our new CCN topology as compared to the 
ordinary  CCN  in  OPNET  with  packet  level  CCN  simulator 
implemented  at  the  top  of  TCP/IP  in  network  nodes.  The 
scenario is depicted in Fig. 6. Different file objects of types 
jpeg,  doc,  mp3  are  retrieved  and  their  performance  is 
measured with the following graphs. The simulation scenario 
consists  of  hybrid  wired  and  wireless  networks  forming 
clusters.  For  simplicity,  only  three  clusters  are  considered 
with only a single base controller at the edge.

supercedes  the  conventional  approach  after  some  time,  as 
there are some overheads initially but it performs better once

it has scanned for the neighbourhood and clusters have fully 
enegized. The  average  of  queing  delay  is  also  much  less  as 
compared  to  the  conventional  approach,  the  scenario  is 
depicted in Fig. 9. The overall result is high throughput yield 
in our approach as compared to the conventional approach as 
is depicted in the last graph Fig. 10.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS 

We  have  conducted  first  mathematical  based  analysis  of 
our technique Clustered CCN or simply CCCN which yielded 
that our technique performs better in terms of delay and server 
performance  especially  when  the  clusters  in  the  tier  are 
selected  on  the  basis  of  relevant  information.  Larger  the 
cluster  size,  larger  the  hit  probability  and  better  efficiency. 
Those  mathematical  calculations  are  in  coherence  with  the 
simulation results. A much better performance  is  yielded  as 
the network is loaded with more interest  queries  but  should 
not exceed the buffer size capacity as the time to live period of 
interest packet is extended, The problem of congestion is rare 
as the size of intermediate router buffers containing CS, PIT 
and FIB enteries are extended and also due to the introduction 
of previously mentioned routing technique.  

The proposed technique can yield fine results when much 
finer granuality is ensured at each tier level. The role of base 
controller  is  very  crucial  and  gives  much  better  results  if 
distributed  cloud  computing  in  terms  of  infrastructure  for 
storage  and  maintenance  is  used  instead  of  integrated 
approach. Possible ramifications of introducing a short prefix 
(instead  of  additional  identifer  that  we  have  used  in  this 
project) that would encompass only a particular tier and based 
on that short prefix, introducing an adaptive naming routing 
scheme for each tier is the future course of action.

Abstract—Since  last  four  decades,  internet  exploration  and 
innovation has touched new horizons but all that advancement 
in  realm  of  internet  was  based  on  peer  to  peer  interaction  or 
mostly  client  server  topology.  There  were  many  loop  holes  in 
such  configuration  as  all  the  communication  was  machine 
identified and all the available resources in the network were not 
fully  utilized,  therefore  a  more  vigorous  content  centric  model 
was proposed and is expanding at a very fast pace in which all 
the data is named and could be searched on the basis of name, 
instead  of  machine  address.  There  are  many  open  challenges 
faced by content centric networks, one is naming of huge amount 
of  data  available  and  efficiently  addressing 
this  data 
dynamically  and  caching  of  huge  information  and  its  fast 
addressing. The other issue of importance is congestion control 
where no host to host based communication is taking place and 
the  nodes  are  searching  and  transferring  required  data  in  an 
independent fashion. The economical solution to the problem of 
global  deployment  of  this  new  technique.  In  our  approach,  we 
have  suggested  and  implemented  a  new  model  that  provides 
remedies  for  current  bottlenecks  in  CCN  by  incorporating  the 
advantages  offered  by  cloud  computing  with  little  overheads. 
We  have  divided  content  centric  networks  in  the  form  of  tiers 
based  on  the  similarity  of  information  that  they  handle  every 
day in close vicinity, the tiers are further divided in to clusters 
whose size and number would be dependent upon the number of 
users.  The  new  approach  has  been  given  the  names  clustered 
CCN or CCCN.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Internet based communication was originally designed for 
host to host or peer to peer with every machine on the internet 
having  unique  identifiers  and  all  the  communication  and 
routing  is  address  based.  Most  of  the  communication  on 
internet  is  client  server  based  e.g.  World  Wide  Web  is 
providing  its  server  based  services  to  most  of  the  internet 
users worldwide to date. 

This scheme is though simple and conventional but has not 
capitalized the full capacity and potential of the network and 
many  of  available  resources  are  not  properly  utilized 
especially when they can be easily available locally. A most 
common example is that Alice wants to get a certain MP3 file 
from a remote server or a copy of it may be placed at a local 
CDN, if that is a popular and most visited Server or CDN then 
Alice has to wait for a remotely placed, busy location whereas 
the  same  information  may  have  been  downloaded  by  an 
adjacent machine in the same local network that may be easily

accessible  as  compared  to  the  previous  situation.  Most  of 
internet  today  is  based  on  content  distribution  e.g.  file 
exchange, audio video streaming etc. that are placed usually 
at popular servers  and    is  mostly  dependent  on  the  location 
where the information is currently placed. Though the use of 
CDN’s  has  helped  in  this  regard  but  they  prove  to  be 
expensive and also ensuring their availability is crucial. Also 
security  related 
issues  arise  regarding  content  easily 
misplaced  over  ordinary  unsecure  connections.  Different 
authentication  and  confidentiality  measures  need  to  be 
adopted  on  node  to  node  interaction  level,  whereas  if  data 
itself is authenticated as in named content technique, need for 
authentication  and  formation  of  VPN’s  is  eliminated  and 
more  suitable  and  reliable  security  measure  based  on  data 
itself can be introduced which will be free from hackers and 
intruders intervention. Another issue related to conventional 
IP based network is the restriction of mobility as we bind a 
host  to  its  location  rather  than  by  the  data  it  contains.  As 
current internet tends to adopt to mobility at a very rapid rate 
so the ordinary use of patching devices with their addresses 
(either  IP  addresses  or  MAC  addresses)  results  in  rigorous 
network  forwarding  based  on  the  location  of  information 
where  the  host  is  placed  rather  than  the  information  name 
itself. Name content centric Networking was introduced few 
years back to propose the shape of future networks and rectify 
the  legacies  of  the  current  TCP/IP  based  communication 
model. Instead of IP node the basic entity, named data is the 
central nexus. CCN architecture consists of named data layout, 
caching within the network and transmission dependent on the 
receiver [1]-[3]. First an interest packet is forwarded that may 
contain  the  name  of  particular  data  required  or  a  prefix  of 
named data dependent on whatever convention is used in the 
network  from  a  host  that  want  to  retrieve  some  data.  The 
network  is  equipped  with  intrinsic  cache  systems  that  are 
sometimes embedded with intermediate routers.  The routers 
used  are  specialized  routers  which  search  and  forward  the 
content  based  on  the  content  name.  The  forwarded  interest 
packet would traverse through the network and on finding a 
match  first  authenticates  and  requests  the  remote  node  that 
may be a cache or any other machine containing the data to 
send that data back to the sender that has initiated the interest 
packet. Now the receiver would forward the data packet to the 
sender  that  is  intermediately  stored  by  routers  or  other 
allowed storage machines as it travels back. The data packets 
traverse  the  same  path  as  that  of  interest  packet.  The 
intermediate  storage  is  for  future  use  of  that  particular  data 
from a local location that was recently retrieved. The data is 
stored along with the version and timing in order to update if a 
fresh copy is available. There are three data structures held by 
each CCN node namely content store (CS), pending interest

table  (PIT)  and  forwarding  information  base  (FIB).  The 
request generated called interest for a particular packet is first 
searched in the local content store and if a match is found, it is 
forwarded locally, if a match is not found then it is searched in 
Pending  interest  table  and  if  a  match  is  found,  meaning 
already  a  pending  request  for  same  data  is  there,  then  the 
interface is the PIT is updated so that when the required data 
is found, it would be forwarded to all the pending interfaces. 
If no match is found in PIT then it is forwarded to FIB, for a 
match. If a match is found, a new entry is made in PIT and the 
interest is forwarded. The path of data return is the same as 
that of the interest. Thus the  major  advantages  gain  in  such 
kind of architecture are reduced congestion owing to content 
caching, better delivery speed, basic and simple configuration 
nomenclature for network devices  and  providing  security  at 
data level instead of network devices based [4]. Comparison 
of CCN with conventional TCP/IP stack. ( See Fig. 1).

II.  CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud  Computing  concept  was  introduced  about  a  mere 
decade ago and since then it has seen a tremendous positive 
response  due  to  the  availability  of  virtual  servers  and  open 
source  utilization.  The  offering  of  application  service 
provision at a remote location has led to the introduction of 
almost all sorts of solutions online ranging from hardware to 
software. The remote renting of resources helps especially in 
the  paradigm  of  information  storage  anywhere  without  the 
need  to  actually  buy  hardware  and  its  corresponding 
maintenance and related software update. The three platforms 
generally offered under the umbrella of cloud computing are 
Software  as  Service,  Platform  as  Service,  Infrastructure  as 
service.  This  concept  of  remote  handling  of  provisioned 
resources can prove very helpful in content centric networks 
[7], and in our model we will use the caching of resources via 
cloud in order to reduce cost and effort for installation of new 
hardware  especially  for  base  controllers  in  our  project  that 
would be located at the edge of each tier.

include  global 

Though  content  centric  networking  offers  a  very  handy 
option for an alternate approach towards our current internet 
services  but  there  are  many  challenges  in  its  effective 
ubiquitous  implementation  [8],  [9].  There  are  four  basic 
problems that we have tried to  rectify in our new approach. 
Those  problems 
cache 
management, and Congestion control and deployment issues. 
There  are  about  more  than  of  the  order  of  105  unique  data 
objects worldwide that needs to be named and a robust and 
efficient  routing  as  well  as  resolution  system  is  required  in 
order  to  provide  global  scalability.  The  major  problem  in 
Cache management is distributed storage capacity, effective 
addressing of data and interconnectivity of different caches. 
The  CCN  architecture  is  receiver  dependent  and  the  end  to 
end  host  communication  rules  are  not  obeyed  as  in 
conventional  architecture,  so  in  case  of  congestion  the  end 
hosts  cannot  throttle  the  data  flow  or  apply  flow  control. 
Deployment of new CCN based architecture requires interest 
from users, business community and other technical  support 
issues relating to scale of deployment based on type of traffic 
flowing  in  vicinity,  information  reuse  model  statistics,  all 
need to be covered, without which this technique may prove 
very costly and alien to current users and ISP’s. Switching to 
this new scheme requires economic incentives to investors in 
order to make this scheme more attractive.  

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  basic  methodology  of  project  is  to  divide  the  global 
access into multiple tiers and clusters and the new technique is 
given  the  name  Clustered  CCN,  those  tiers  are  not  the 
conventional tiers as we interpret in terms of internet service 
providers.  These  tiers  are  formed  on  the  basis  of  level  and 
type of data that is generated in particular vicinity. Those tiers 
may  be  formed  by  users  independent  of  ISP’s,  by  simply 
joining based on the type of information they require mostly. 
But we have divided for simplicity our CCCN into three tiers.

Increased  granularity  at  base  level  would  ensure  better 
handling  of  named  contents.  Numerous  clusters  would  be 
formed within a particular tier based on the number of users 
and connections in the near vicinity. At the edge of each tier, a 
base controller is introduced that would be similar to a CDN. 
Each  tier  would  have  a  special  search  preference  within  it 
before passing through base controller for search of data into 
another  tier.  A  particular  tier  form  a  type  of  Adhoc 
configuration  with  the  advantage  of  fast  searching  and 
matching  as  special  identifiers  are  appended  along  with  the 
name prefix. 

Tier-I consist of ordinary customers, that are either mobile 
or  immobile  or  Adhoc  based.  In  Tier-I  There  could  be 
multiple clusters but for simplicity we have considered only 
one cluster per tier. The advantage of cluster is that with in a 
tier,  data  is  first  searched  in  the  current  cluster  and  then 
adjoining  clusters  of  a  particular  tier.  For  a  CCN  interest 
request  generated  by  any  of  the  hosts  with  in  a  cluster,  it 
would first be routed within that particular cluster of that tier. 
The  routing  scheme  for  each  tier  would  be  different.  If 
nothing found in the first tier of cluster of machines, it would 
be forwarded to next tier through a base controller that would 
be  monitoring  the  requests  flow  and  data  between  adjacent 
tiers. This approach would be similar to Tier based cluster of 
Adhoc nodes with the only exception that once an interest is 
not  successful  in  a  particular  tier,  it  would  be  routed  via  a 
central  Base  Controller  of  that  particular  tier  that  would 
update  its  information  after  every  successful  data  retrieval 
from the other tier. In our topology we have supposed that ISP 
has  no  restriction  on  the  storage  of  data  in  any  particular 
device  or  networking  node.  In  a  particular  tier,  the  data 
naming would be local and would be differentiated from the 
other  tier  by  means  of  identifier  in  each  particular  tier  that 
would be unique, though the name of data would be the same 
but  only  the  addressing  and  routing  convention  would  be 
simplified  by  appending  a  particular  identifier  with  the 
naming  prefix  in  the  order  of  hierarchical  name  that  can 
simplify  the  search  for  similar  data  routes  and  would  be 
included  in  the  scope  area  of  the  interest  packet.  This 
technique can ensure a fast data routing based on the prefix 
identifier  of  that  particular  tier.  When  a  particular  tier  is 
unsuccessful in retrieving data, the timer would  live  on  and 
would  be  readjusted  at  the  base  controller  along  with 
appending new prefix identifier for the next tier and removing 
the  previous  identifier.    The  same  cycle  is  repeated  for  the 
second and third tier. The second tier would be a broad based 
tier whose cluster would cover up to a particular country level. 
When  the  interest  request  arrives  in  tier-II,  it  would  be 
processed in the same fashion and if the data is not found in 
tier-II  then  it  would  be  forwarded  to  tier-III  by  passing 
through  another  base  controller.  The  introduction  of  base 
controller ensures that even if a device that may have the copy 
of information is not active then ultimately based controller 
can provide the data, if it was previously requested via it as it 
updates  its  database  on  each  request  through  it,  so  in  this 
fashion  not  only  nodes  in  clusters  store  passing  data  after 
authentication but also a central base controller of  each  tier 
also provides back up. The base controller at any particular 
tier  on  retrieval  of  required  data  from  higher  tier  would 
remove  the  upper  level  identifier  and  would  route  it  to  the 

224

conjurer of interest packet, keeping record of the copy to itself 
also.  Tier-III would be the largest including servers of large 
enterprisers. A basic form of first tier based cluster is shown 
below in Fig. 3.

A.  Base Controller 

The use of base controller is pivotal  to the approach as it 
would be required if a particular request/interest is not found 
in  a  particular  tier.  The  memory  size  of  base  controller 
depends on the tier end where it is located e.g. the lowest tier 
would have the small memory and database requirements as 
compared to higher tier base controller. The traffic at any base 
controller can be modeled as 

Based  on  the  popularity  of  content,  the  jth  request 

probability is given by  

 

 

Pj = (1/j)/∑jԑC 1/j                                            (1) 

where C is the content requested, Pj is the probability of that 
content. 

The  objects  that  are  to  be  requested  at  hierarchal  base 

controllers have the probability

Efficient lookup at the base controller would be possible as 
the requests possibility/probability to the higher level is low 
as  most  interests  would  be  entertained  at  either  the  cluster 
level or lower base controller and so would the look up time 
and  complexity  and  the  higher  tier  edge  base  controllers 
would  have  small  number  of  interest  hits  so  managing  the 
higher  memory  base  controllers  would  be  eased  as  there 
would be less traffic through them.

the form of clusters of nodes in a particular tier and the data 
stored in them is mostly repeated so no need for huge cache 
management for individual devices. Also the introduction of 
one central cache management at base controller can provide 
a huge cache of local files accessed. Use of specific prefix for 
a particular tier helps in fast registering and matching indexes 
even  with  long  sequences  in  cache  search.  The  issue  of 
deployment is solved by introducing cloud computing and the 
services  of  virtual  network  devices  help  to  encompass  the 
location per resources issues. The platform used in this case is 
infrastructure  as  services  of  cloud  computing  that  would 
include  not  only  support  for  heavy  cache  storage  at  base 
controller levels but also the virtual realization of specialized 
named based routers at intermediate tiers.  

B.  Cluster Based Identifier in Naming Prefix 

In case of CCN, longest match of prefix is used for any look 
up. As there is huge number of naming prefixes all over the 
internet so introducing all of them in any particular router FIB 
is not possible so a scaled approach is required. One of  the 
solutions to minimize the memory requirement for a FIB data 
structure is by using Bloom algorithm filter as in [10], yet this 
approach is not sufficient for restriction in the management of 
entries of FIB. In our approach one benefit of cluster based 
routing would be that the number of entries in the FIB would 
be  small  and  introduction  of  multi-hierarchal  structure 
reduces  the  length  of  route.  In  our  approach  a  particular 
cluster would introduce a DNS type route search as shown in 
the Fig. 5 below:

As  can  be  seen,  the  basic  mechanism  of  forwarding  is 
similar  to  the  conventional  CCN  architecture,  with  the  only 
difference that the prefix contains an additional identifier for a 
particular tier which helps in identification of interest being 
generated  by  which  tier  and  its  current  status,  as  the  tiers 
hierarchy is predefined. In case of failure of prefix match in 
CS, PIT, FIB, along with updating the PIT, the interest packet 
would  not  time  out.  The  time  out  mechanism  has  been 
extended in this scheme to the point of final base controller 
which  will  be  lying  at  the  end  of  tier  III  which  will  only 
discard  the  interest  packet.  So,  in  this  project,  the  size  of 
buffers  at  intermediate  routers  is  kept  large.  The  global 
scalability  problem  can  be  reduced  with  fast  routing  by 
dividing  network  in  to  tiers  containing  clusters  of  network 
nodes.  Within  a  particular 
tier,  routing  and  naming 
convention  is  local  so  a  fast  speed  overlook  could  be 
performed. We are currently working on a fast naming based 
routing algorithm for intermediate routers that would further 
suite our topology. The problem of cache management is also 
resolved owing to fact that we have divided our approach in 

225

Fig. 5. DNS based route search. 

 
A  special  identifier  would  be  placed  in  the  hierarchal 
naming prefix in order to cope up with the scalability problem 
with in a particular router FIB. Following would the steps in 
our  route  formation.  In  the  first  phase  any  particular  node 
search  for  adjacent  neighbors  and  then  introduce  the  route 
notification to inform the rest of the nodes about itself and in 
the later phase FIB entries are constructed cluster-wise, that is 
done by aggregating the nodes  that  are  searched  in  the  first 
phase  and  by  using  this  aggregation  the  size  of  entries  in  a 
particular FIB would be significantly reduced. In aggregation 
those  entries  that  have  the  same  route  outgoing  would  be 
combined into a single entry instead. 

C.  Cache Management 

The cache management in CCN can be divided in to main 
categories,  one  is  the  in  network  cache  and  the  other  is  the 
edge cache. In our topology the edge cache would be the base 
controller.  The  in  network  cache  would  refer  to  the  local 

 

Journal of Advances in Computer Networks, Vol. 2, No. 3, September 2014

 

cache  at  the  router.  The  information/content  objects  are 
arranged in the form of binary search tree. The content store at 
any  router  in  a  particular  cluster  would  contain  a  packet 
storage that is indexed to accelerate to process of matching. In 
order  to  keep  in  view  the  requirement  of  popular  content 
demand,  the  indexing  is  modified  with  the  inclusion  of  a 
popularity counter index that would increase with the number 
of recent hits and would have the high priority in search. This 
approach can result in low access time due to small coverage 
and inclusion of popularity index. The insertion/update, look 
up and deletion of content is governed by binary search tree 
algorithm.  Within  cache  the  content  objects  are  stored  and 
replaced  in  accordance  with  the  policies  of  both  Least 
Recently  Used  (LRU)  and  Least  Frequency  Used  (LFU) 
discussed in [11]. 

D.  Congestion Control 

time  out 

In case of content centric networks, simple transport layer 
protocols that have the tendency to cope up with the problem 
of congestion cannot be introduced as the data/content object 
can  be  retrieved  from  multiple  sources  and  there  is  no 
particular RTT that could be defined and time outs cannot be 
defined discretely. In [12], [13] the retransmission timer for 
interest  is  calculated  from  the  previous  data  objects  as 
samples,  whereas  in  case  of  [14]  for  each  data  source  a 
particular 
is  maintained  but  the  underlying 
assumption that the receiver knows the location of every data 
source  even  before  the  transfer  and  there  is  no  change  of 
location  during  the  transfer  that  is  not  possible  as  the  CCN 
requests  could  be  fulfilled  by  multiple  sources.  The 
introduction of cluster based traffic increases the probability 
of single time out value as the caches would be close to each 
other. Other factors that reduce congestion in our topology are 
effective  cache  management,  reduced  traffic  in  a  particular 
cluster. This topology performs well for congestion cases that 
are originated mostly from single source. For the case where 
the  traffic  is  originated  from  multiple  sources,  content 
collection  from  multiple  sources  is  taken  into  account  and 
would  require  a  premature  or  future  anticipated  interest 
packet  calculation  and  calculating  individual  timeouts  from 
each particular source. 

E.  Router Dynamics 

In conventional routers there are two memory architectures 
namely  multicasting  and  multi-matching.  In  multicasting 
there is forward information base, multicast expansion table 
and adjacency table. Forwarding information table holds the 
address  of  source  and  information  of  multicast  ring. 
Adjacency  table  has  the  rewrite  multicast  expansion  table 
index  and  MAC  those  are  memory  types  and  have  a  finite 
capacity. In case of multi-matching, the destination address is 
compared  with  the  forwarding  entry  in  the  table  and  the 
longest  match  is  the  resultant  prefix  match.  The  forwarding 
table  memory  is  composed  of  special  ternary  content 
addressable  memory  (TCAM)  that  is  used  for  high  speed 
search  and  the  resultant  search  is  returned  to  SRAM  by 
priority  encoders. 
routers, 
multicasting  is  done  by  a  match  of  TCAM  entry  with  the 
desired address output and the resultant interface is stored in 
multicast  expansion  table.  In  our  topology  we  have  used

active TCAM and passive SRAM which can ensure a parallel 
and high speed search. 

F.  Delay Analysis 

In  our  technique,  introduction  of  tier  based  clustering 
reduces the delay time td because the hit probability of getting 
the  same  information  within  a  particular  tier  is  higher.  The 
second factor is the size of local caches is reduced. Thirdly the 
introduction  of  base  controller  would  ensure  a  swift  data 
retrieval  if  any  such  copy  has  been  passed  before  from  the 
upper

calculations.

In  our  technique,  the  value  of  Td  would  decrease  as  the 
value  of  the  denominator  in  the  above  equation  would 
increase,  owing  to  the  fact  of  better  cache  hits  and 
improvement in the content arrival rates.

The number of hops would be reduced in a particular tier as 
the tiers are based on similarity of information and so would 
be the probability of lesser number of hops and greater chance 
of successful hit after lesser number of hops. 

 

V.  SIMULATIONS 

Two test beds were set up with different scenarios to check 
the performance of our new CCN topology as compared to the 
ordinary  CCN  in  OPNET  with  packet  level  CCN  simulator 
implemented  at  the  top  of  TCP/IP  in  network  nodes.  The 
scenario is depicted in Fig. 6. Different file objects of types 
jpeg,  doc,  mp3  are  retrieved  and  their  performance  is 
measured with the following graphs. The simulation scenario 
consists  of  hybrid  wired  and  wireless  networks  forming 
clusters.  For  simplicity,  only  three  clusters  are  considered 
with only a single base controller at the edge. 

In the first case as shown in Fig. 7. the delay statistics for 
the  convntional  and  our  approach

differentiator  mode  and  our  approach  has  less  delay  spread 
for  individual  hits  and  better  tuned.  In  the  second  case  of 
server  performance  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.  our  approach 
supercedes  the  conventional  approach  after  some  time,  as 
there are some overheads initially but it performs better once

it has scanned for the neighbourhood and clusters have fully 
enegized. The  average  of  queing  delay  is  also  much  less  as 
compared  to  the  conventional  approach,  the  scenario  is 
depicted in Fig. 9. The overall result is high throughput yield 
in our approach as compared to the conventional approach as 
is depicted in the last graph Fig. 10.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS 

We  have  conducted  first  mathematical  based  analysis  of 
our technique Clustered CCN or simply CCCN which yielded 
that our technique performs better in terms of delay and server 
performance  especially  when  the  clusters  in  the  tier  are 
selected  on  the  basis  of  relevant  information.  Larger  the 
cluster  size,  larger  the  hit  probability  and  better  efficiency. 
Those  mathematical  calculations  are  in  coherence  with  the 
simulation results. A much better performance  is  yielded  as 
the network is loaded with more interest  queries  but  should 
not exceed the buffer size capacity as the time to live period of 
interest packet is extended, The problem of congestion is rare 
as the size of intermediate router buffers containing CS, PIT 
and FIB enteries are extended and also due to the introduction 
of previously mentioned routing technique.  

The proposed technique can yield fine results when much 
finer granuality is ensured at each tier level. The role of base 
controller  is  very  crucial  and  gives  much  better  results  if 
distributed  cloud  computing  in  terms  of  infrastructure  for 
storage  and  maintenance  is  used  instead  of  integrated 
approach. Possible ramifications of introducing a short prefix 
(instead  of  additional  identifer  that  we  have  used  in  this 
project) that would encompass only a particular tier and based 
on that short prefix, introducing an adaptive naming routing 
scheme for each tier is the future course of action.
