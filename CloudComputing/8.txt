Abstract  In this paper, we are proposing a new cloud computing solution for government hospitals of 3rd world 
countries  to  better  access  patient’s  medical  information.  Existing  system  is  based  on  manual  paper  work  and 
independent standalone applications in some districts’/ small towns’ hospitals which results in waste of resources, 
high construction and  maintenance costs and difficult to  manage  and  maintain. The  main objective of proposing 
cloud based solution is to reduce the cost (construction and maintenance), to reduce data loss risk, to gather all the 
government  hospitals  on  one  platform  to  better  access  patients’  medical  information  for  easy  management  and 
maintenance. The proposed cloud computing solution is intended to be used by government hospitals of 3rd world 
countries;  however  the  solution  is  generic  and  can  be  used  by  government  hospitals  of  any  country  and  the 
community based hospitals.

2.1. Data Sharing  

Currently, most of the hospitals (either district hospital 
or  town  hospital)  are  maintaining  patients’  medical 
information  and  some  staff  management  operations 
manually (on papers); however some of the hospitals have 
their  own  independent  standalone  HIS  system.  This 
creates a high risk for data loss and the problematic issues 
in  data  sharing.  The  main  problematic  issue  is  that  the 
patients could not seek proper treatment in any hospital of 
the  other  district  or  town  because  of  the  existing 
independent  information  systems  due  to  lack  of  data 
sharing.

and 

Setting up an information system has never been a big 
issue; however managing, upgrading and maintaining the 
information  system  have  always  been  a  big  concern. 
Existing independent standalone HIS systems are hard to 
manage,  upgrade  and  maintain;  as  for  different  hospitals 
in  different  districts/towns,  separate  management  and 
maintenance is required. 

However,  management  and  maintenance  process 
requires continuous investment including technical skills, 
proper  users  and  experts.  Upgrading 
the  current 
information  system  has  also  been  a  big  issue  as  the  user 
needs/requirements are changing with time to time. This is 
same  in  hospitals  as  different  hospitals  produce different 
individual  needs/requirements  for  upgrading  the  current 
HIS system. The work regarding HIS technical services is 
carried out in [2].

Cloud computing remains  the focusing area  since past 
few  years.  Cloud  computing  is  basically  a  network 
(internet)  based  innovative  model  and  is  referred  as 
platforms,  infrastructure  and  software  sold  as  a  service. 
The  main  objective  or  goral  of  cloud  computing  is  to

Cloud  computing  is  being  promoted  by  many  of  the 
large  companies.  In  cloud  computing  a  program  or 
application  can  be  run  on  many  computers.  Cloud  has 
become  the  essential  necessity  to  survive  in  the  market, 
that’s  the  reason  for  most  of  the  companies  to  move 
towards the cloud. In [3,4,5] an extended work is carried

Cloud  computing  is  growing  in  almost  every  field 
including  healthcare  services  providing  a  new  and  better 
way to incorporate the foregoing problems. Some related 
research work is as under: 

1.  In  [6],  the  cloud  computing  model  is  proposed  to 
share  the  critical  disease  and  critical  cases  information 
among  the  doctors  of  the  different  countries  to  improve 
the treatment.

We have proposed a new cloud computing solution for 
the  government  hospitals  of  3rd  world  countries  to  better 
access  patient’s  medical  information.  Cloud  based  HIS 
facilitates  the  experienced  doctors  to  better  diagnose  the 
patients. Cloud computing solution offers major practical 
advantages such as reduced construction, maintenance and

deploying hybrid cloud model. The proposed model is for 
government  hospitals  of  3rd  world  countries;  however  it 
can  also  be  adopted  by  community  hospitals  to  save  the

3. Cloud Computing 

Cloud computing remains  the focusing area  since past 
few  years.  Cloud  computing  is  basically  a  network 
(internet)  based  innovative  model  and  is  referred  as 
platforms,  infrastructure  and  software  sold  as  a  service. 
The  main  objective  or  goral  of  cloud  computing  is  to 
reduce 
the 
organizations.  In  addition  to  this,  it  offers  organizations 
better performance, security and less maintenance cost.

Figure 3.1. Cloud computing types 

Cloud  computing  is  being  promoted  by  many  of  the 
large  companies.  In  cloud  computing  a  program  or 
application  can  be  run  on  many  computers.  Cloud  has 
become  the  essential  necessity  to  survive  in  the  market, 
that’s  the  reason  for  most  of  the  companies  to  move 
towards the cloud. In [3,4,5] an extended work is carried 
out.

3.1. Cloud Computing in Medical Aspects 

Cloud  computing  is  growing  in  almost  every  field 
including  healthcare  services  providing  a  new  and  better 
way to incorporate the foregoing problems. Some related 
research work is as under: 

1.  In  [6],  the  cloud  computing  model  is  proposed  to 
share  the  critical  disease  and  critical  cases  information 
among  the  doctors  of  the  different  countries  to  improve 
the treatment.  

2. Moreover the work in [7] is related about the cloud 

computing in medical aspects.

Solution

Our proposed new cloud computing solution is  hybrid 
cloud  deployment  model.  Hybrid  cloud  model  contains 
the  Private  cloud  which  facilitates  the  hospitals  of  the 
different  districts/towns 
important 
information regarding patient’s medical history, laboratory 
reports, 
treatment/ 
prescription  details  etc.  On  the  other  hand  hybrid  cloud 
model also contains public cloud to facilitate some normal 
management (such as staff) and also facilitates the outside 
users for appointment and viewing laboratory reports etc.

5. Conclusion 

We have proposed a new cloud computing solution for 
the  government  hospitals  of  3rd  world  countries  to  better 
access  patient’s  medical  information.  Cloud  based  HIS 
facilitates  the  experienced  doctors  to  better  diagnose  the 
patients. Cloud computing solution offers major practical 
advantages such as reduced construction, maintenance and 
up  gradation  cost.  The  security  risk  can  be  removed  by 
deploying hybrid cloud model. The proposed model is for 
government  hospitals  of  3rd  world  countries;  however  it 
can  also  be  adopted  by  community  hospitals  to  save  the 
cost 
in 
improvement of other healthcare services.
