not  only  provided  leverage  from  the  requirement  of  costly  hardware  equipment  by 
Cloud computing, rather it has reduced the requirement and  complexity from  customer

The history of cloud computing is endemic with data  disclosures either premeditated 
or  unpremeditated.  This  discloses  the  risks  of  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  the  cloud 
data  storage  deployment.  The  first  ever  kind  of  the  risk  is  the  unintentional  disclosure

is unsatisfactory. In reality, Twitter made an agreement with Federal Trade  commission 
of the  United  States due to its sloppy security practices  which  allowed the attackers to 
masquerade  as  any  authorize  user  of  the  system  in  2011  [ 7].  In  addition,  several  sites 
have  encountered  occurrences  of  security  breaches  which  results  in  th e  data  lose  of 
users which not only include email addresses but credit card numbers as well [ 8].  

Cloud  data  service  providers  encounter  huge  amount  of  pressure  from  government 
agencies  the  world  over  to  reveal  the  private  data  of  the  users’  when  needed.  S uch  as, 
Google Inc. complies with most of the requests it receives to give the private data of its 
clients  [9].  Additionally,  government  agencies  of  several  countries  have  threatened  to 
block  blackberry  email  services  if  they  are  not  given  the  right  to  mon itor  the  users’ 
private data [10].    

Sometime the providers of cloud services frequently encompass some money-making 
inducement  from  different  parties  and  thus  willingly  divulge  the  users’  private  data, 
which the users think is private. Google and  Face book are two of the service providers 
which have destabilized their policy and default settings of privacy in order to endorsed 
new  products  and  services.  Moreover,  if  a  provider  of  cloud  service  still  keeps  its 
promise still the data is at menace [11, 12].  Users have a strong concern over the data 
confidentiality, security and unauthorized access [ 13]. This problem became even worse 
in  the  case  of  cloud  computing  as  the  user  does  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the 
physical  location  of  the  data  and  control  over  the  data  center.  A  mischievous  data 
service  provider  can  possibly  damage  users'  data  by  updating,  plummeting, 
transforming, or falsifying segments of the data.  

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.  
 
2. Review of Related Literature 

As  our  work  is  based  on  providing  trusted  storage  architecture  for  cloud  computing 
and security is considered to be the first and last component of trust metrics. Therefore 
we  surveyed  the  literature  for  previous  work  on  securing  cloud  storage  and  found  that 
numerous  systems  and  methods  are  incorporated  to  secure  the  cloud  from  different 
perspective.  Some  of  the  systems  work  to  develop  a  trusted  cloud  environment  by 
providing high level of security. A number of researchers had presented different model 
to  divide  and  store  the  user  data  on  different  cloud  providers  as  alternative  to  a  single 
storage service provider.      

A  trusted  computing  environment  was  proposed  by  researchers  for  cloud  computing  in 
2010. The platform provides the protection of data by implementing a strong authentication 
mechanism,  and  the  access  is  restricted  by  role  based  access  control  method  in  cloud 
computing system [14]. A multi  – clouds database model was presented as an alternative to 
single cloud environment by the authors in [16]. The purpose of this model was to safeguard

the cloud system from the peril of malevolent insider threat and circumvent the failure of the 
whole cloud services infrastructure. A novel architecture for authenticated key exchange was 
proposed with the name of cloud computing background key exchange. It utilizes the internet 
key  exchange  and  randomness  reuse  approach  for  key  exchange  [17].  Trust  management  is 
the prime concern of research for most of the researcher. The model TFMC introduced a trust 
management model for cloud computing which is based on the fuzzy set theory [18]. The user 
can  use  this  model  in  decision  making  during  the  selection  of  a  specific  cloud  service 
provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of different cloud service providers. The model also 
provides  trust  relationship  among  multiple  cloud  providers.  A  unique  cost  effective  and 
secure model of data distribution is proposed for multi – cloud storage by the authors in [19]. 
The  main  idea  behind  this  model  is  to  provide  a  low  cost  mechanism  of  user’s  data 
distribution of on available multiple cloud storage providers 

The single sign on (SSO) is implemented on the top layer of the cloud computing  model. 
The  rationale  to  this  mechanism  was  to  present  the  user  with  the  best  of  quality  of  service 
including secure storage and availability of data [13, 20]. This method lessens the number of 
login and increase the security of the overall system. 
    Privacy  preserving  and  public  auditability  has  been  the  focus  of  different  research  work 
[21, 22, 23]. The authors proposed a public auditing architecture for cloud computing keeping 
the  privacy  preserved  [24].  This  architecture  not  only  provide  the  privacy  preservation  but 
also support activity like block less verification, public auditability dynamic operation support 
on data. On the other hand the authors have proved that the architecture presented is insecure 
due  to  its  incapability  to  stand  against  the  existential  forgery  implementing  by  a  known 
message attack [25].  The authors proposed a protocol for dynamic data auditing on the cloud 
server that can carry out run time operations on data in [23]. The disadvantage of this scheme 
is that the data may be disclosed to the auditor as the server sends the linear blocks of data to 
the auditor.   

It is evident from the above discussion that a lot of research has been carried out and still a 
lot of research works is going on to make cloud computing a secure and trusted technology 
for the customers.  However, several works of this kind are enduring different kind of security 
issues.  Some  cannot  thwart  the  illegitimate  data  access  by  the  cloud  service  provider  while 
some face the problem of insider malevolent activity. A number of mechanisms are expensive 
not  only  in  terms  of  finances,  but  due  to  requirement  of  a  time  for  data  processing  and  the 
availability of data are affected. So, to avoid these disadvantages the architecture proposed in 
this  paper  will  allow  only  the  legitimate  user to  access  and  store  data  with  confidence. The 
prime advantage of this scheme is that, it will not only provide security of data at rest (storage 
at  cloud  server),  but  will  also  provide  protection  in  data  during  the  transmission  at 
transmission media. 
 
3. The Proposed Architecture  

The proposed architecture is composed of two modules, i.e. the client module and the 

server module. The general description of the model is given in the following figure.

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.  
 
2. Review of Related Literature 

As  our  work  is  based  on  providing  trusted  storage  architecture  for  cloud  computing 
and security is considered to be the first and last component of trust metrics. Therefore 
we  surveyed  the  literature  for  previous  work  on  securing  cloud  storage  and  found  that 
numerous  systems  and  methods  are  incorporated  to  secure  the  cloud  from  different 
perspective.  Some  of  the  systems  work  to  develop  a  trusted  cloud  environment  by 
providing high level of security. A number of researchers had presented different model 
to  divide  and  store  the  user  data  on  different  cloud  providers  as  alternative  to  a  single 
storage service provider.      

A  trusted  computing  environment  was  proposed  by  researchers  for  cloud  computing  in 
2010. The platform provides the protection of data by implementing a strong authentication 
mechanism,  and  the  access  is  restricted  by  role  based  access  control  method  in  cloud 
computing system [14]. A multi  – clouds database model was presented as an alternative to 
single cloud environment by the authors in [16]. The purpose of this model was to safeguard

the cloud system from the peril of malevolent insider threat and circumvent the failure of the 
whole cloud services infrastructure. A novel architecture for authenticated key exchange was 
proposed with the name of cloud computing background key exchange. It utilizes the internet 
key  exchange  and  randomness  reuse  approach  for  key  exchange  [17].  Trust  management  is 
the prime concern of research for most of the researcher. The model TFMC introduced a trust 
management model for cloud computing which is based on the fuzzy set theory [18]. The user 
can  use  this  model  in  decision  making  during  the  selection  of  a  specific  cloud  service 
provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of different cloud service providers. The model also 
provides  trust  relationship  among  multiple  cloud  providers.  A  unique  cost  effective  and 
secure model of data distribution is proposed for multi – cloud storage by the authors in [19]. 
The  main  idea  behind  this  model  is  to  provide  a  low  cost  mechanism  of  user’s  data 
distribution of on available multiple cloud storage providers 

The single sign on (SSO) is implemented on the top layer of the cloud computing  model. 
The  rationale  to  this  mechanism  was  to  present  the  user  with  the  best  of  quality  of  service 
including secure storage and availability of data [13, 20]. This method lessens the number of 
login and increase the security of the overall system. 
    Privacy  preserving  and  public  auditability  has  been  the  focus  of  different  research  work 
[21, 22, 23]. The authors proposed a public auditing architecture for cloud computing keeping 
the  privacy  preserved  [24].  This  architecture  not  only  provide  the  privacy  preservation  but 
also support activity like block less verification, public auditability dynamic operation support 
on data. On the other hand the authors have proved that the architecture presented is insecure 
due  to  its  incapability  to  stand  against  the  existential  forgery  implementing  by  a  known 
message attack [25].  The authors proposed a protocol for dynamic data auditing on the cloud 
server that can carry out run time operations on data in [23]. The disadvantage of this scheme 
is that the data may be disclosed to the auditor as the server sends the linear blocks of data to 
the auditor.   

It is evident from the above discussion that a lot of research has been carried out and still a 
lot of research works is going on to make cloud computing a secure and trusted technology 
for the customers.  However, several works of this kind are enduring different kind of security 
issues.  Some  cannot  thwart  the  illegitimate  data  access  by  the  cloud  service  provider  while 
some face the problem of insider malevolent activity. A number of mechanisms are expensive 
not  only  in  terms  of  finances,  but  due  to  requirement  of  a  time  for  data  processing  and  the 
availability of data are affected. So, to avoid these disadvantages the architecture proposed in 
this  paper  will  allow  only  the  legitimate  user to  access  and  store  data  with  confidence. The 
prime advantage of this scheme is that, it will not only provide security of data at rest (storage 
at  cloud  server),  but  will  also  provide  protection  in  data  during  the  transmission  at 
transmission media. 
 
3. The Proposed Architecture  

The proposed architecture is composed of two modules, i.e. the client module and the 

server module. The general description of the model is given in the following figure.

3.1. The Client Module 

The  client  module  is  mainly  composed  of  three  components.  The  access  control 
component,  the  split  and  merge  component  and  the  encrypt/decrypt  component.  The 
working of each component is explained separately. 

 

3.1.1.  The Client Access Control Component:  

The  access  control  component  is  responsible  of  the  authentication  and  authorization 
of  the  cloud  user.  The  simplest  mechanism  of  authentication  is  a  user  name  and 
password. But this is too weak method of authentication for cloud computing. The user 
will login with its user credentials  (User Name, Password) and the cloud access control 
component  generates  the  two  session  password  randomly.  One  is  sent  to  the  user’s 
official email account and the other is sent to a mobile number of the user. The user can 
be  authenticated  using  both  of  these  session  passwords.  Once  the  authentication  is 
complete the access control module will go into the back ground and the rest of the data 
access  and  storage  will  be  done  through  split  and  merge  and  encrypt  and  decrypt 
components.

Abstract 

The  cloud  storage  provides  a  least  cost  means  of  data  storage  for  the  small  and  large 
enterprises  across  the  globe.  But  the  main  barricade  to  wide  spread  adoption  of  cloud 
storage is the lake of trust in the technology by its user. The data is stored on multiple servers 
and the location is concealed from the customers and they are no more in control of the data. 
This distinctive feature  of the  cloud  storage  presents many  security  and trust challenges.  In 
this paper we present a trusted architecture of cloud data storage. The architecture presents 
a  unique  way  of  secure  storage  and  accessing  of  data  from  the  cloud  data  center.  It  also 
ensured that only authorized user will be able to access the data. Additionally, if there is any 
violation of the security parameter at the data center, the data will still be safe i.e. the data 
will be stored in encrypted form.

1. Introduction 

A  novel  architecture  of  information  system  is  presented  in  the  recent  past  by  the 
name  of  cloud  computing,  which  is  indeed  seen  to  be  a  revolution  in  the  history  of 
computing  industry.  This  computing  paradigm  proffer  a  unique  structure  of  the 
utilization  of  computing  resources  to  business  and  individual  user  by  a  third  party 
companies as alternative to their own computing infrastructure [1, 2]. The customers are 
not  only  provided  leverage  from  the  requirement  of  costly  hardware  equipment  by 
Cloud computing, rather it has reduced the requirement and  complexity from  customer 
point  of  view.  Cloud  computing  present’s  users  the  hallucination  of   unlimited 
computing  resources.  The  user  can  utilize  computing  resources  as  large,  or  as 
diminutive  as  they  required,  irrespective  trepidation  of  the  maintenance  and  provision 
of those resources [3, 4].  

The history of cloud computing is endemic with data  disclosures either premeditated 
or  unpremeditated.  This  discloses  the  risks  of  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  the  cloud 
data  storage  deployment.  The  first  ever  kind  of  the  risk  is  the  unintentional  disclosure 
of  data  which  happens  because  of  the  errors  in  the  design  of  the  cloud  computing 
software  of  the  providers.  For  instance,  the  non-authenticated  users  were  allowed  to 
view  the  documents  by  Google  Docs  due  to  a  bug  [5],  whereas  the  Flicker  and  Face 
book have also leaked the private pictures of the users due to flaws [6].  

Normally  all  cloud  computing  data  centers  have  a  central  server  administration 
system,  which  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  overall  operations  of  the  data 
center.  Cloud  computing  provides  centralized  storage,  processing  memory,  and  
bandwidth. Due the centralization of computing resources make it attractive targets for 
insider or outsider attackers. The cloud data service provider’s record of protecting data

is unsatisfactory. In reality, Twitter made an agreement with Federal Trade  commission 
of the  United  States due to its sloppy security practices  which  allowed the attackers to 
masquerade  as  any  authorize  user  of  the  system  in  2011  [ 7].  In  addition,  several  sites 
have  encountered  occurrences  of  security  breaches  which  results  in  th e  data  lose  of 
users which not only include email addresses but credit card numbers as well [ 8].  

Cloud  data  service  providers  encounter  huge  amount  of  pressure  from  government 
agencies  the  world  over  to  reveal  the  private  data  of  the  users’  when  needed.  S uch  as, 
Google Inc. complies with most of the requests it receives to give the private data of its 
clients  [9].  Additionally,  government  agencies  of  several  countries  have  threatened  to 
block  blackberry  email  services  if  they  are  not  given  the  right  to  mon itor  the  users’ 
private data [10].    

Sometime the providers of cloud services frequently encompass some money-making 
inducement  from  different  parties  and  thus  willingly  divulge  the  users’  private  data, 
which the users think is private. Google and  Face book are two of the service providers 
which have destabilized their policy and default settings of privacy in order to endorsed 
new  products  and  services.  Moreover,  if  a  provider  of  cloud  service  still  keeps  its 
promise still the data is at menace [11, 12].  Users have a strong concern over the data 
confidentiality, security and unauthorized access [ 13]. This problem became even worse 
in  the  case  of  cloud  computing  as  the  user  does  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the 
physical  location  of  the  data  and  control  over  the  data  center.  A  mischievous  data 
service  provider  can  possibly  damage  users'  data  by  updating,  plummeting, 
transforming, or falsifying segments of the data.  

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.

3.1. The Client Module 

The  client  module  is  mainly  composed  of  three  components.  The  access  control 
component,  the  split  and  merge  component  and  the  encrypt/decrypt  component.  The 
working of each component is explained separately. 

 

3.1.1.  The Client Access Control Component:  

The  access  control  component  is  responsible  of  the  authentication  and  authorization

3.1.2.  The Split and Merge Component: 

 After  authentication,  the  user  will  be  granted  access  to  the  cloud  data  storage 
services. When the client  wants to send data, the data will be  split first by  the split  by 
using the split algorithm. The data can be received and merge algorithm  will be used to 
see the original data form. The split algorithm divide the data into even and odd bits of 
information and then the merge algorithm reverse the process. 
 
3.1.3.  Encrypt/Decrypt Component:  

     After  the  data  is  split  by  the  split  and  merge  component,  it  is  then  send  to 
encrypt/decrypt  component.  The  encrypt/decrypt  component  after  applying  the  AES 
encryption techniques send the encrypted data to cloud storage server, where the data is 
stored in the public component of the data storage server while  the key will be store in 
the private data component. The same mechanism is applied when the data is requested 
back from the storage. The key is taken from the private data component and data from 
the  public  data  component  after  decrypting  the  data  is  given   back  to  split  and  merge 
component where the merger algorithm is used to generate the original data.  

 

3.2.  The Server Module 

The  cloud  server  module  of  our  architecture  is  also  composed  of  three  components. 
These  components  include  the  authentication  component,   the  private  data  component 
and  the  public  data  component.  The  working  of  these  components  is  explained  as 
follows. 

 

3.2.1 Authentication Component:  

     The  authentication  component  works  in  close  connection  with  the  private  data 
component  of  the  server  module.  When  the  server  receives  a  request  for  the 
authorization  of  data  access,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  authentication  module  to 
randomly  generate  two  session  password  and  send  one  of  it  to  user’s  official  email 
account  and  the  other  to  the  mobile  number.  The  user  is  then  authenticated  after 
checking the session passwords from the user. 
 
3.2.2. Private Data Component: 

    The  private  data  component  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  storage  of  the  user’s 
credentials (Login Information). But it is also responsible for the storage of secrete keys 
needed  for  the  decryption  of  the  data  store  in  the  public  section  of  the  cloud  storage. 
Only the owner of the data is able to access the private data section of the cloud storage 
and perform operation like update, delete, append on the data. The user cannot perform 
data operations on private data section. 
 
3.2.3.  Public Data Component:  

    The public component stores the data which will be shared among all the authorized 
users of the specific data. All the data stored in the public data section will be present in 
encrypted  form.  The  owner  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  creation  of  data  in  this 
component, but also for the different data operations as well.

physical  location  of  the  data  and  control  over  the  data  center.  A  mischievous  data 
service  provider  can  possibly  damage  users'  data  by  updating,  plummeting, 
transforming, or falsifying segments of the data.  

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.  
 
2. Review of Related Literature 

As  our  work  is  based  on  providing  trusted  storage  architecture  for  cloud  computing 
and security is considered to be the first and last component of trust metrics. Therefore 
we  surveyed  the  literature  for  previous  work  on  securing  cloud  storage  and  found  that 
numerous  systems  and  methods  are  incorporated  to  secure  the  cloud  from  different 
perspective.  Some  of  the  systems  work  to  develop  a  trusted  cloud  environment  by 
providing high level of security. A number of researchers had presented different model 
to  divide  and  store  the  user  data  on  different  cloud  providers  as  alternative  to  a  single 
storage service provider.      

A  trusted  computing  environment  was  proposed  by  researchers  for  cloud  computing  in 
2010. The platform provides the protection of data by implementing a strong authentication 
mechanism,  and  the  access  is  restricted  by  role  based  access  control  method  in  cloud 
computing system [14]. A multi  – clouds database model was presented as an alternative to 
single cloud environment by the authors in [16]. The purpose of this model was to safeguard

the cloud system from the peril of malevolent insider threat and circumvent the failure of the 
whole cloud services infrastructure. A novel architecture for authenticated key exchange was 
proposed with the name of cloud computing background key exchange. It utilizes the internet 
key  exchange  and  randomness  reuse  approach  for  key  exchange  [17].  Trust  management  is 
the prime concern of research for most of the researcher. The model TFMC introduced a trust 
management model for cloud computing which is based on the fuzzy set theory [18]. The user 
can  use  this  model  in  decision  making  during  the  selection  of  a  specific  cloud  service 
provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of different cloud service providers. The model also 
provides  trust  relationship  among  multiple  cloud  providers.  A  unique  cost  effective  and 
secure model of data distribution is proposed for multi – cloud storage by the authors in [19]. 
The  main  idea  behind  this  model  is  to  provide  a  low  cost  mechanism  of  user’s  data 
distribution of on available multiple cloud storage providers 

The single sign on (SSO) is implemented on the top layer of the cloud computing  model. 
The  rationale  to  this  mechanism  was  to  present  the  user  with  the  best  of  quality  of  service 
including secure storage and availability of data [13, 20]. This method lessens the number of 
login and increase the security of the overall system. 
    Privacy  preserving  and  public  auditability  has  been  the  focus  of  different  research  work 
[21, 22, 23]. The authors proposed a public auditing architecture for cloud computing keeping 
the  privacy  preserved  [24].  This  architecture  not  only  provide  the  privacy  preservation  but 
also support activity like block less verification, public auditability dynamic operation support 
on data. On the other hand the authors have proved that the architecture presented is insecure 
due  to  its  incapability  to  stand  against  the  existential  forgery  implementing  by  a  known 
message attack [25].  The authors proposed a protocol for dynamic data auditing on the cloud 
server that can carry out run time operations on data in [23]. The disadvantage of this scheme 
is that the data may be disclosed to the auditor as the server sends the linear blocks of data to 
the auditor.   

It is evident from the above discussion that a lot of research has been carried out and still a 
lot of research works is going on to make cloud computing a secure and trusted technology 
for the customers.  However, several works of this kind are enduring different kind of security 
issues.  Some  cannot  thwart  the  illegitimate  data  access  by  the  cloud  service  provider  while 
some face the problem of insider malevolent activity. A number of mechanisms are expensive 
not  only  in  terms  of  finances,  but  due  to  requirement  of  a  time  for  data  processing  and  the 
availability of data are affected. So, to avoid these disadvantages the architecture proposed in 
this  paper  will  allow  only  the  legitimate  user to  access  and  store  data  with  confidence. The 
prime advantage of this scheme is that, it will not only provide security of data at rest (storage 
at  cloud  server),  but  will  also  provide  protection  in  data  during  the  transmission  at 
transmission media. 
 
3. The Proposed Architecture  

The proposed architecture is composed of two modules, i.e. the client module and the 

server module. The general description of the model is given in the following figure.

Figure 1. Block Diagram of the Proposed Architecture 

 

 
3.1. The Client Module 

The  client  module  is  mainly  composed  of  three  components.  The  access  control 
component,  the  split  and  merge  component  and  the  encrypt/decrypt  component.  The 
working of each component is explained separately. 

 

3.1.1.  The Client Access Control Component:  

The  access  control  component  is  responsible  of  the  authentication  and  authorization 
of  the  cloud  user.  The  simplest  mechanism  of  authentication  is  a  user  name  and 
password. But this is too weak method of authentication for cloud computing. The user 
will login with its user credentials  (User Name, Password) and the cloud access control 
component  generates  the  two  session  password  randomly.  One  is  sent  to  the  user’s 
official email account and the other is sent to a mobile number of the user. The user can 
be  authenticated  using  both  of  these  session  passwords.  Once  the  authentication  is 
complete the access control module will go into the back ground and the rest of the data 
access  and  storage  will  be  done  through  split  and  merge  and  encrypt  and  decrypt 
components.

3.1.2.  The Split and Merge Component: 

 After  authentication,  the  user  will  be  granted  access  to  the  cloud  data  storage 
services. When the client  wants to send data, the data will be  split first by  the split  by 
using the split algorithm. The data can be received and merge algorithm  will be used to 
see the original data form. The split algorithm divide the data into even and odd bits of 
information and then the merge algorithm reverse the process. 
 
3.1.3.  Encrypt/Decrypt Component:  

     After  the  data  is  split  by  the  split  and  merge  component,  it  is  then  send  to 
encrypt/decrypt  component.  The  encrypt/decrypt  component  after  applying  the  AES 
encryption techniques send the encrypted data to cloud storage server, where the data is 
stored in the public component of the data storage server while  the key will be store in 
the private data component. The same mechanism is applied when the data is requested 
back from the storage. The key is taken from the private data component and data from 
the  public  data  component  after  decrypting  the  data  is  given   back  to  split  and  merge 
component where the merger algorithm is used to generate the original data.  

 

3.2.  The Server Module 

The  cloud  server  module  of  our  architecture  is  also  composed  of  three  components. 
These  components  include  the  authentication  component,   the  private  data  component 
and  the  public  data  component.  The  working  of  these  components  is  explained  as 
follows. 

 

3.2.1 Authentication Component:  

     The  authentication  component  works  in  close  connection  with  the  private  data 
component  of  the  server  module.  When  the  server  receives  a  request  for  the 
authorization  of  data  access,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  authentication  module  to 
randomly  generate  two  session  password  and  send  one  of  it  to  user’s  official  email 
account  and  the  other  to  the  mobile  number.  The  user  is  then  authenticated  after 
checking the session passwords from the user. 
 
3.2.2. Private Data Component: 

    The  private  data  component  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  storage  of  the  user’s 
credentials (Login Information). But it is also responsible for the storage of secrete keys 
needed  for  the  decryption  of  the  data  store  in  the  public  section  of  the  cloud  storage. 
Only the owner of the data is able to access the private data section of the cloud storage 
and perform operation like update, delete, append on the data. The user cannot perform 
data operations on private data section. 
 
3.2.3.  Public Data Component:  

    The public component stores the data which will be shared among all the authorized 
users of the specific data. All the data stored in the public data section will be present in 
encrypted  form.  The  owner  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  creation  of  data  in  this 
component, but also for the different data operations as well.

4. Security Analysis of the Architecture 

The  proposed  architecture  is  simple  and  secure.  The  access  is  controlled  by 
implementing  a  multifactor  and  multi-level  authentication  mechanism  [13].  Beside  the 
accessibility, the data is provided multiple level of security by the introduction of split 
and merge technique before the encryption process which also makes it more secure. As 
we  know  that  there  are  a  lot  of  cryptographic  algorithms  which  are  considered  to  be 
efficient at algorithmic level.  In our  architecture we used  AES  Rijendael algorithm for 
encryption  of  data  files.  The  overall  performance  of  this  scheme  is  best  regarding 
software and  hardware implementation. The algorithm is simple, fast and compact [ 26, 
27, 28, 29].   

 

5. Conclusion 

The  users  of  cloud  technology  are  increasing  rapidly.  A  trusted  architec ture  of  data 
storage  is  presented  for  cloud  computing.  It  not  only  provides  secure  access  but  also 
provides  a trusted  mechanism  for  data transmission through a  channel. The  multi level 
access  control refrain the unauthorized user from  access data while t he split and merge 
technique  provide  extra  security  layer  before  it  is  encrypted  by  the  encryption 
algorithm. This  process is reversed in the case  of downloading the data from  the  cloud 
storage  server.  The  suggested  architecture  increases  the  level  of  conf identiality  and 
integrity of the stored data.

Abstract 

The  cloud  storage  provides  a  least  cost  means  of  data  storage  for  the  small  and  large 
enterprises  across  the  globe.  But  the  main  barricade  to  wide  spread  adoption  of  cloud 
storage is the lake of trust in the technology by its user. The data is stored on multiple servers 
and the location is concealed from the customers and they are no more in control of the data. 
This distinctive feature  of the  cloud  storage  presents many  security  and trust challenges.  In 
this paper we present a trusted architecture of cloud data storage. The architecture presents 
a  unique  way  of  secure  storage  and  accessing  of  data  from  the  cloud  data  center.  It  also 
ensured that only authorized user will be able to access the data. Additionally, if there is any 
violation of the security parameter at the data center, the data will still be safe i.e. the data 
will be stored in encrypted form.

1. Introduction 

A  novel  architecture  of  information  system  is  presented  in  the  recent  past  by  the 
name  of  cloud  computing,  which  is  indeed  seen  to  be  a  revolution  in  the  history  of 
computing  industry.  This  computing  paradigm  proffer  a  unique  structure  of  the 
utilization  of  computing  resources  to  business  and  individual  user  by  a  third  party 
companies as alternative to their own computing infrastructure [1, 2]. The customers are 
not  only  provided  leverage  from  the  requirement  of  costly  hardware  equipment  by 
Cloud computing, rather it has reduced the requirement and  complexity from  customer 
point  of  view.  Cloud  computing  present’s  users  the  hallucination  of   unlimited 
computing  resources.  The  user  can  utilize  computing  resources  as  large,  or  as 
diminutive  as  they  required,  irrespective  trepidation  of  the  maintenance  and  provision 
of those resources [3, 4].  

The history of cloud computing is endemic with data  disclosures either premeditated 
or  unpremeditated.  This  discloses  the  risks  of  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  the  cloud 
data  storage  deployment.  The  first  ever  kind  of  the  risk  is  the  unintentional  disclosure 
of  data  which  happens  because  of  the  errors  in  the  design  of  the  cloud  computing 
software  of  the  providers.  For  instance,  the  non-authenticated  users  were  allowed  to 
view  the  documents  by  Google  Docs  due  to  a  bug  [5],  whereas  the  Flicker  and  Face 
book have also leaked the private pictures of the users due to flaws [6].  

Normally  all  cloud  computing  data  centers  have  a  central  server  administration 
system,  which  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  overall  operations  of  the  data 
center.  Cloud  computing  provides  centralized  storage,  processing  memory,  and  
bandwidth. Due the centralization of computing resources make it attractive targets for 
insider or outsider attackers. The cloud data service provider’s record of protecting data

is unsatisfactory. In reality, Twitter made an agreement with Federal Trade  commission 
of the  United  States due to its sloppy security practices  which  allowed the attackers to 
masquerade  as  any  authorize  user  of  the  system  in  2011  [ 7].  In  addition,  several  sites 
have  encountered  occurrences  of  security  breaches  which  results  in  th e  data  lose  of 
users which not only include email addresses but credit card numbers as well [ 8].  

Cloud  data  service  providers  encounter  huge  amount  of  pressure  from  government 
agencies  the  world  over  to  reveal  the  private  data  of  the  users’  when  needed.  S uch  as, 
Google Inc. complies with most of the requests it receives to give the private data of its 
clients  [9].  Additionally,  government  agencies  of  several  countries  have  threatened  to 
block  blackberry  email  services  if  they  are  not  given  the  right  to  mon itor  the  users’ 
private data [10].    

Sometime the providers of cloud services frequently encompass some money-making 
inducement  from  different  parties  and  thus  willingly  divulge  the  users’  private  data, 
which the users think is private. Google and  Face book are two of the service providers 
which have destabilized their policy and default settings of privacy in order to endorsed 
new  products  and  services.  Moreover,  if  a  provider  of  cloud  service  still  keeps  its 
promise still the data is at menace [11, 12].  Users have a strong concern over the data 
confidentiality, security and unauthorized access [ 13]. This problem became even worse 
in  the  case  of  cloud  computing  as  the  user  does  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the 
physical  location  of  the  data  and  control  over  the  data  center.  A  mischievous  data 
service  provider  can  possibly  damage  users'  data  by  updating,  plummeting, 
transforming, or falsifying segments of the data.  

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.

component  generates  the  two  session  password  randomly.  One  is  sent  to  the  user’s 
official email account and the other is sent to a mobile number of the user. The user can 
be  authenticated  using  both  of  these  session  passwords.  Once  the  authentication  is 
complete the access control module will go into the back ground and the rest of the data 
access  and  storage  will  be  done  through  split  and  merge  and  encrypt  and  decrypt 
components.

3.1.2.  The Split and Merge Component: 

 After  authentication,  the  user  will  be  granted  access  to  the  cloud  data  storage 
services. When the client  wants to send data, the data will be  split first by  the split  by 
using the split algorithm. The data can be received and merge algorithm  will be used to 
see the original data form. The split algorithm divide the data into even and odd bits of 
information and then the merge algorithm reverse the process. 
 
3.1.3.  Encrypt/Decrypt Component:  

     After  the  data  is  split  by  the  split  and  merge  component,  it  is  then  send  to 
encrypt/decrypt  component.  The  encrypt/decrypt  component  after  applying  the  AES 
encryption techniques send the encrypted data to cloud storage server, where the data is 
stored in the public component of the data storage server while  the key will be store in 
the private data component. The same mechanism is applied when the data is requested 
back from the storage. The key is taken from the private data component and data from 
the  public  data  component  after  decrypting  the  data  is  given   back  to  split  and  merge 
component where the merger algorithm is used to generate the original data.  

 

3.2.  The Server Module 

The  cloud  server  module  of  our  architecture  is  also  composed  of  three  components. 
These  components  include  the  authentication  component,   the  private  data  component 
and  the  public  data  component.  The  working  of  these  components  is  explained  as 
follows. 

 

3.2.1 Authentication Component:  

     The  authentication  component  works  in  close  connection  with  the  private  data 
component  of  the  server  module.  When  the  server  receives  a  request  for  the 
authorization  of  data  access,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  authentication  module  to 
randomly  generate  two  session  password  and  send  one  of  it  to  user’s  official  email 
account  and  the  other  to  the  mobile  number.  The  user  is  then  authenticated  after 
checking the session passwords from the user. 
 
3.2.2. Private Data Component: 

    The  private  data  component  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  storage  of  the  user’s 
credentials (Login Information). But it is also responsible for the storage of secrete keys 
needed  for  the  decryption  of  the  data  store  in  the  public  section  of  the  cloud  storage. 
Only the owner of the data is able to access the private data section of the cloud storage 
and perform operation like update, delete, append on the data. The user cannot perform 
data operations on private data section. 
 
3.2.3.  Public Data Component:  

    The public component stores the data which will be shared among all the authorized 
users of the specific data. All the data stored in the public data section will be present in 
encrypted  form.  The  owner  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  creation  of  data  in  this 
component, but also for the different data operations as well.

4. Security Analysis of the Architecture 

The  proposed  architecture  is  simple  and  secure.  The  access  is  controlled  by 
implementing  a  multifactor  and  multi-level  authentication  mechanism  [13].  Beside  the 
accessibility, the data is provided multiple level of security by the introduction of split 
and merge technique before the encryption process which also makes it more secure. As 
we  know  that  there  are  a  lot  of  cryptographic  algorithms  which  are  considered  to  be 
efficient at algorithmic level.  In our  architecture we used  AES  Rijendael algorithm for 
encryption  of  data  files.  The  overall  performance  of  this  scheme  is  best  regarding 
software and  hardware implementation. The algorithm is simple, fast and compact [ 26, 
27, 28, 29].   

 

5. Conclusion 

The  users  of  cloud  technology  are  increasing  rapidly.  A  trusted  architec ture  of  data 
storage  is  presented  for  cloud  computing.  It  not  only  provides  secure  access  but  also 
provides  a trusted  mechanism  for  data transmission through a  channel. The  multi level 
access  control refrain the unauthorized user from  access data while t he split and merge 
technique  provide  extra  security  layer  before  it  is  encrypted  by  the  encryption 
algorithm. This  process is reversed in the case  of downloading the data from  the  cloud 
storage  server.  The  suggested  architecture  increases  the  level  of  conf identiality  and 
integrity of the stored data.

Abstract 

The  cloud  storage  provides  a  least  cost  means  of  data  storage  for  the  small  and  large 
enterprises  across  the  globe.  But  the  main  barricade  to  wide  spread  adoption  of  cloud 
storage is the lake of trust in the technology by its user. The data is stored on multiple servers 
and the location is concealed from the customers and they are no more in control of the data. 
This distinctive feature  of the  cloud  storage  presents many  security  and trust challenges.  In 
this paper we present a trusted architecture of cloud data storage. The architecture presents 
a  unique  way  of  secure  storage  and  accessing  of  data  from  the  cloud  data  center.  It  also 
ensured that only authorized user will be able to access the data. Additionally, if there is any 
violation of the security parameter at the data center, the data will still be safe i.e. the data 
will be stored in encrypted form.  

 
Keywords: Trusted Storage, Security Challenges, Access Control, Cloud Computing 

 
1. Introduction 

A  novel  architecture  of  information  system  is  presented  in  the  recent  past  by  the 
name  of  cloud  computing,  which  is  indeed  seen  to  be  a  revolution  in  the  history  of 
computing  industry.  This  computing  paradigm  proffer  a  unique  structure  of  the 
utilization  of  computing  resources  to  business  and  individual  user  by  a  third  party 
companies as alternative to their own computing infrastructure [1, 2]. The customers are 
not  only  provided  leverage  from  the  requirement  of  costly  hardware  equipment  by 
Cloud computing, rather it has reduced the requirement and  complexity from  customer 
point  of  view.  Cloud  computing  present’s  users  the  hallucination  of   unlimited 
computing  resources.  The  user  can  utilize  computing  resources  as  large,  or  as 
diminutive  as  they  required,  irrespective  trepidation  of  the  maintenance  and  provision 
of those resources [3, 4].  

The history of cloud computing is endemic with data  disclosures either premeditated 
or  unpremeditated.  This  discloses  the  risks  of  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  the  cloud 
data  storage  deployment.  The  first  ever  kind  of  the  risk  is  the  unintentional  disclosure 
of  data  which  happens  because  of  the  errors  in  the  design  of  the  cloud  computing 
software  of  the  providers.  For  instance,  the  non-authenticated  users  were  allowed  to 
view  the  documents  by  Google  Docs  due  to  a  bug  [5],  whereas  the  Flicker  and  Face 
book have also leaked the private pictures of the users due to flaws [6].  

Normally  all  cloud  computing  data  centers  have  a  central  server  administration 
system,  which  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  overall  operations  of  the  data 
center.  Cloud  computing  provides  centralized  storage,  processing  memory,  and  
bandwidth. Due the centralization of computing resources make it attractive targets for 
insider or outsider attackers. The cloud data service provider’s record of protecting data

is unsatisfactory. In reality, Twitter made an agreement with Federal Trade  commission 
of the  United  States due to its sloppy security practices  which  allowed the attackers to 
masquerade  as  any  authorize  user  of  the  system  in  2011  [ 7].  In  addition,  several  sites 
have  encountered  occurrences  of  security  breaches  which  results  in  th e  data  lose  of 
users which not only include email addresses but credit card numbers as well [ 8].  

Cloud  data  service  providers  encounter  huge  amount  of  pressure  from  government 
agencies  the  world  over  to  reveal  the  private  data  of  the  users’  when  needed.  S uch  as, 
Google Inc. complies with most of the requests it receives to give the private data of its 
clients  [9].  Additionally,  government  agencies  of  several  countries  have  threatened  to 
block  blackberry  email  services  if  they  are  not  given  the  right  to  mon itor  the  users’ 
private data [10].    

Sometime the providers of cloud services frequently encompass some money-making 
inducement  from  different  parties  and  thus  willingly  divulge  the  users’  private  data, 
which the users think is private. Google and  Face book are two of the service providers 
which have destabilized their policy and default settings of privacy in order to endorsed 
new  products  and  services.  Moreover,  if  a  provider  of  cloud  service  still  keeps  its 
promise still the data is at menace [11, 12].  Users have a strong concern over the data 
confidentiality, security and unauthorized access [ 13]. This problem became even worse 
in  the  case  of  cloud  computing  as  the  user  does  not  have  any  knowledge  about  the 
physical  location  of  the  data  and  control  over  the  data  center.  A  mischievous  data 
service  provider  can  possibly  damage  users'  data  by  updating,  plummeting, 
transforming, or falsifying segments of the data.  

Trust in the cloud is mainly dependent on the security of the service provider. It is a 
well-known fact that if the system is secure, then it will be trustworthy [ 11, 14, 15]. In 
this paper a trusted architecture for data storage in cloud computing which will augment 
in  a  whole  the  security  of  cloud  computing  environment   is  proposed.  The  cloud  data 
architecture  is  generally  composed  of  three  entities  at  large,  which  are  the  cloud 
servers, the media and the client. Majority of the research work is done on securing the 
server  but  less  importance  is  given  to  the  media  of  transfer  between  the  client  an d  the 
cloud  environment.  A  comprehensive  architecture  is  presented  in  this  paper  which 
covers  all  the  aspect.  i.e.,  access  control,  data  transfer  through  media  and  finally  data 
storage at the cloud computing data storage center. This will results, enhancing t rust on 
cloud computing.  
 
2. Review of Related Literature 

As  our  work  is  based  on  providing  trusted  storage  architecture  for  cloud  computing 
and security is considered to be the first and last component of trust metrics. Therefore 
we  surveyed  the  literature  for  previous  work  on  securing  cloud  storage  and  found  that 
numerous  systems  and  methods  are  incorporated  to  secure  the  cloud  from  different 
perspective.  Some  of  the  systems  work  to  develop  a  trusted  cloud  environment  by 
providing high level of security. A number of researchers had presented different model 
to  divide  and  store  the  user  data  on  different  cloud  providers  as  alternative  to  a  single 
storage service provider.      

A  trusted  computing  environment  was  proposed  by  researchers  for  cloud  computing  in 
2010. The platform provides the protection of data by implementing a strong authentication 
mechanism,  and  the  access  is  restricted  by  role  based  access  control  method  in  cloud 
computing system [14]. A multi  – clouds database model was presented as an alternative to 
single cloud environment by the authors in [16]. The purpose of this model was to safeguard

the cloud system from the peril of malevolent insider threat and circumvent the failure of the 
whole cloud services infrastructure. A novel architecture for authenticated key exchange was 
proposed with the name of cloud computing background key exchange. It utilizes the internet 
key  exchange  and  randomness  reuse  approach  for  key  exchange  [17].  Trust  management  is 
the prime concern of research for most of the researcher. The model TFMC introduced a trust 
management model for cloud computing which is based on the fuzzy set theory [18]. The user 
can  use  this  model  in  decision  making  during  the  selection  of  a  specific  cloud  service 
provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of different cloud service providers. The model also 
provides  trust  relationship  among  multiple  cloud  providers.  A  unique  cost  effective  and 
secure model of data distribution is proposed for multi – cloud storage by the authors in [19]. 
The  main  idea  behind  this  model  is  to  provide  a  low  cost  mechanism  of  user’s  data 
distribution of on available multiple cloud storage providers 

The single sign on (SSO) is implemented on the top layer of the cloud computing  model. 
The  rationale  to  this  mechanism  was  to  present  the  user  with  the  best  of  quality  of  service 
including secure storage and availability of data [13, 20]. This method lessens the number of 
login and increase the security of the overall system. 
    Privacy  preserving  and  public  auditability  has  been  the  focus  of  different  research  work 
[21, 22, 23]. The authors proposed a public auditing architecture for cloud computing keeping 
the  privacy  preserved  [24].  This  architecture  not  only  provide  the  privacy  preservation  but 
also support activity like block less verification, public auditability dynamic operation support 
on data. On the other hand the authors have proved that the architecture presented is insecure 
due  to  its  incapability  to  stand  against  the  existential  forgery  implementing  by  a  known 
message attack [25].  The authors proposed a protocol for dynamic data auditing on the cloud 
server that can carry out run time operations on data in [23]. The disadvantage of this scheme 
is that the data may be disclosed to the auditor as the server sends the linear blocks of data to 
the auditor.   

It is evident from the above discussion that a lot of research has been carried out and still a 
lot of research works is going on to make cloud computing a secure and trusted technology 
for the customers.  However, several works of this kind are enduring different kind of security 
issues.  Some  cannot  thwart  the  illegitimate  data  access  by  the  cloud  service  provider  while 
some face the problem of insider malevolent activity. A number of mechanisms are expensive 
not  only  in  terms  of  finances,  but  due  to  requirement  of  a  time  for  data  processing  and  the 
availability of data are affected. So, to avoid these disadvantages the architecture proposed in 
this  paper  will  allow  only  the  legitimate  user to  access  and  store  data  with  confidence. The 
prime advantage of this scheme is that, it will not only provide security of data at rest (storage 
at  cloud  server),  but  will  also  provide  protection  in  data  during  the  transmission  at 
transmission media. 
 
3. The Proposed Architecture  

The proposed architecture is composed of two modules, i.e. the client module and the 

server module. The general description of the model is given in the following figure.

Figure 1. Block Diagram of the Proposed Architecture 

 

 
3.1. The Client Module 

The  client  module  is  mainly  composed  of  three  components.  The  access  control 
component,  the  split  and  merge  component  and  the  encrypt/decrypt  component.  The 
working of each component is explained separately. 

 

3.1.1.  The Client Access Control Component:  

The  access  control  component  is  responsible  of  the  authentication  and  authorization 
of  the  cloud  user.  The  simplest  mechanism  of  authentication  is  a  user  name  and 
password. But this is too weak method of authentication for cloud computing. The user 
will login with its user credentials  (User Name, Password) and the cloud access control 
component  generates  the  two  session  password  randomly.  One  is  sent  to  the  user’s 
official email account and the other is sent to a mobile number of the user. The user can 
be  authenticated  using  both  of  these  session  passwords.  Once  the  authentication  is 
complete the access control module will go into the back ground and the rest of the data 
access  and  storage  will  be  done  through  split  and  merge  and  encrypt  and  decrypt 
components.

3.1.2.  The Split and Merge Component: 

 After  authentication,  the  user  will  be  granted  access  to  the  cloud  data  storage 
services. When the client  wants to send data, the data will be  split first by  the split  by 
using the split algorithm. The data can be received and merge algorithm  will be used to 
see the original data form. The split algorithm divide the data into even and odd bits of 
information and then the merge algorithm reverse the process. 
 
3.1.3.  Encrypt/Decrypt Component:  

     After  the  data  is  split  by  the  split  and  merge  component,  it  is  then  send  to 
encrypt/decrypt  component.  The  encrypt/decrypt  component  after  applying  the  AES 
encryption techniques send the encrypted data to cloud storage server, where the data is 
stored in the public component of the data storage server while  the key will be store in 
the private data component. The same mechanism is applied when the data is requested 
back from the storage. The key is taken from the private data component and data from 
the  public  data  component  after  decrypting  the  data  is  given   back  to  split  and  merge 
component where the merger algorithm is used to generate the original data.  

 

3.2.  The Server Module 

The  cloud  server  module  of  our  architecture  is  also  composed  of  three  components. 
These  components  include  the  authentication  component,   the  private  data  component 
and  the  public  data  component.  The  working  of  these  components  is  explained  as 
follows. 

 

3.2.1 Authentication Component:  

     The  authentication  component  works  in  close  connection  with  the  private  data 
component  of  the  server  module.  When  the  server  receives  a  request  for  the 
authorization  of  data  access,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  authentication  module  to 
randomly  generate  two  session  password  and  send  one  of  it  to  user’s  official  email 
account  and  the  other  to  the  mobile  number.  The  user  is  then  authenticated  after 
checking the session passwords from the user. 
 
3.2.2. Private Data Component: 

    The  private  data  component  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  storage  of  the  user’s 
credentials (Login Information). But it is also responsible for the storage of secrete keys 
needed  for  the  decryption  of  the  data  store  in  the  public  section  of  the  cloud  storage. 
Only the owner of the data is able to access the private data section of the cloud storage 
and perform operation like update, delete, append on the data. The user cannot perform 
data operations on private data section. 
 
3.2.3.  Public Data Component:  

    The public component stores the data which will be shared among all the authorized 
users of the specific data. All the data stored in the public data section will be present in 
encrypted  form.  The  owner  is  not  only  responsible  for  the  creation  of  data  in  this 
component, but also for the different data operations as well.

4. Security Analysis of the Architecture 

The  proposed  architecture  is  simple  and  secure.  The  access  is  controlled  by 
implementing  a  multifactor  and  multi-level  authentication  mechanism  [13].  Beside  the 
accessibility, the data is provided multiple level of security by the introduction of split 
and merge technique before the encryption process which also makes it more secure. As 
we  know  that  there  are  a  lot  of  cryptographic  algorithms  which  are  considered  to  be 
efficient at algorithmic level.  In our  architecture we used  AES  Rijendael algorithm for 
encryption  of  data  files.  The  overall  performance  of  this  scheme  is  best  regarding 
software and  hardware implementation. The algorithm is simple, fast and compact [ 26, 
27, 28, 29].   

 

5. Conclusion 

The  users  of  cloud  technology  are  increasing  rapidly.  A  trusted  architec ture  of  data 
storage  is  presented  for  cloud  computing.  It  not  only  provides  secure  access  but  also 
provides  a trusted  mechanism  for  data transmission through a  channel. The  multi level 
access  control refrain the unauthorized user from  access data while t he split and merge 
technique  provide  extra  security  layer  before  it  is  encrypted  by  the  encryption 
algorithm. This  process is reversed in the case  of downloading the data from  the  cloud 
storage  server.  The  suggested  architecture  increases  the  level  of  conf identiality  and 
integrity of the stored data.
