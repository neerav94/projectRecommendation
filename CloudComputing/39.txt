ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions.

business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online.

cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to 

 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
present  cloud  computing  definitions  and  basic  terminology  of 
mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that, 
respectively in the next section the discussion of related work 
of mobile cloud computing.  Following that, respectively in the 
in  section  4  present  problem  definitions  and  system  model, 
and the description of partition cost module and the evaluation. 
Finally, the conclusion lies in the last section. 

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We

which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between

using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision,

computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to

mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that,

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

For our experiment, we calculate the effects of Sending com-
putation to cloud web service and back with results and study-
ing the Offloading computation to save energy on power con-
sumption  for  smartphone  mobile  in  case  of  running  all 
processes of application on mobile or by partition and offload-
ing processes to cloud  

 

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server  
 
a) 

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud

for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone  (satellite)  )  or  from  mobile  network  (this 
step execute on mobile device ) 

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference

4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

For our experiment, we calculate the effects of Sending com-
putation to cloud web service and back with results and study-
ing the Offloading computation to save energy on power con-
sumption  for  smartphone  mobile  in  case  of  running  all 
processes of application on mobile or by partition and offload-
ing processes to cloud  

 

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server  
 
a) 

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud

for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone  (satellite)  )  or  from  mobile  network  (this 
step execute on mobile device ) 

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation 
on cloud

ferent algorithms calculations performed on cloud

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference

4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to 

 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
present  cloud  computing  definitions  and  basic  terminology  of 
mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that, 
respectively in the next section the discussion of related work 
of mobile cloud computing.  Following that, respectively in the 
in  section  4  present  problem  definitions  and  system  model, 
and the description of partition cost module and the evaluation. 
Finally, the conclusion lies in the last section. 

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

For our experiment, we calculate the effects of Sending com-
putation to cloud web service and back with results and study-
ing the Offloading computation to save energy on power con-
sumption  for  smartphone  mobile  in  case  of  running  all 
processes of application on mobile or by partition and offload-
ing processes to cloud  

 

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server  
 
a) 

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud

for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone  (satellite)  )  or  from  mobile  network  (this 
step execute on mobile device ) 

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation 
on cloud

phones  as  resource  providers  and  shows  the  feasibility  of 
such a mobile cloud.

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference

4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application. 
 
Keywords : Cloud computing, Mobile cloud computing (MCC), GPS, offloading, Partitioning and migration 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to 

 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
present  cloud  computing  definitions  and  basic  terminology  of 
mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that, 
respectively in the next section the discussion of related work 
of mobile cloud computing.  Following that, respectively in the 
in  section  4  present  problem  definitions  and  system  model, 
and the description of partition cost module and the evaluation. 
Finally, the conclusion lies in the last section. 

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server  
 
a) 

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone  (satellite)  )  or  from  mobile  network  (this 
step execute on mobile device ) 

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation 
on cloud  
the distance between two point or more using dif-
ferent algorithms calculations performed on cloud 
the distance between two point or more using dif-
ferent algorithms

It was presented in [20] „Hyrax‟ for Android smartphone appli-
cations which are distributed both in terms of data and compu-
tation based on Hadoop ported to the Android platform. Hyrax 
(Figure.4) explores the possibility of using a cluster of mobile 
phones  as  resource  providers  and  shows  the  feasibility  of 
such a mobile cloud.

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

receive  results,  CPU  usage,  Time  consumed  for 
calculation,  battery  consumed  to  perform  the 
transmitting data, time consumed for calculations 
and for getting points

If  performance  is  an  issue  and  accuracy  less  important,  for 
small  distances Pythagoras‟ 
theorem can  be  used  on 
anequirectangular projection

4.1  Mathematical Calculation 
 
4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference 
(long2− long1), R is earth‟s radius(mean radius = 6,371km) 
 
4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

- According to partition algorithm, most of resources consumed 
on  mobile  smartphone  will  decrease  to  approximately  to  half 
as shown in fig 11. in case of partition and offloading applica-

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed the elastic partition algorithm and 
partition  cost  module.  Sending  computation  to  another  ma-
chine is a good idea. Thus, cloud computing can save energy 
for mobile users through computation offloading. Virtualization, 
a  fundamental  feature  in  cloud  computing,  lets  applications 
from  different  customers  run  on  different  virtual  machines, 
thereby  providing  separation  and  protection.  The  advantages 
of Mobile Cloud Computing: Cloud computing can be a prom-

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to

mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that, 
respectively in the next section the discussion of related work 
of mobile cloud computing.  Following that, respectively in the 
in  section  4  present  problem  definitions  and  system  model,

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

For our experiment, we calculate the effects of Sending com-
putation to cloud web service and back with results and study-

sumption  for  smartphone  mobile  in  case  of  running  all 
processes of application on mobile or by partition and offload-
ing processes to cloud  

 

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference

4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

- According to partition algorithm, most of resources consumed 
on  mobile  smartphone  will  decrease  to  approximately  to  half 
as shown in fig 11. in case of partition and offloading applica-
tion  most  of  resources  consumed  on  cloud  and  minimize  the

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed the elastic partition algorithm and 
partition  cost  module.  Sending  computation  to  another  ma-
chine is a good idea. Thus, cloud computing can save energy 
for mobile users through computation offloading. Virtualization, 
a  fundamental  feature  in  cloud  computing,  lets  applications 
from  different  customers  run  on  different  virtual  machines, 
thereby  providing  separation  and  protection.  The  advantages 
of Mobile Cloud Computing: Cloud computing can be a prom-
ising solution for mobile computing due to many reasons (e.g., 
mobility,  communication,  and  portability  so  that  cloud  can  be 
used  to  overcome  obstacles  in  mobile  computing,  thereby 
pointing out advantages of MCC. Mobile cloud computing can 
extending battery lifetime (Battery is one of the main concerns 
for  mobile  devices).  And  can  reduce  power  consumption  for 
mobile  devices.  these  solutions  require  changes  in  the struc-
ture  of  mobile  devices,  and  mobile  application  .Computation 
ofﬂoading technique is proposed with the objective to migrate 
the  large  computations  and  complex  processing  from  re-
source-limited  devices  (i.e.,  mobile  devices)  to  resourceful 
machines  (i.e.,  servers  in  clouds).  This  avoids  taking  a  long 
application execution time on mobile devices which results in 
large amount of power consumption. The results demonstrate 
that  the  remote  application  execution  can  save  energy 
signiﬁcantly  In  mobile  cloud  computing,  application  offloading 
is  implemented  as  a  software  level  solution  for  augmenting 
computing capabilities of smart mobile devices. In this paper, 
we  present  a  survey  of  the  energy-efficient  technologies  in 
mobile  cloud  computing,  provide  the  definitions  and  architec-
tural designs of MCC. We summarize related works in energy-
efficient  wireless  transmission. We  believe  that  there  are  still 
great  opportunities  for  researchers  to  make  ground-breaking 
contributions  in  this  field,  thus  bringing  significant  impacts  to 
the development in the industry. We hope our work will provide 
a  better  understanding  of  design  challenges  surrounding  en-

ergy-efficient MCC

ABSTRACT: With the increasing use of smartphones devices, mobile applications with richer functionalities are becoming ubiquitous but mobile devices 
are limited by their resources for computing and power consumption. Cloud the place for abundant resources. Clouds provide opportunity to do huge 
computations quickly and accurately so we can use cloud for mobile computations. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines mobile computing 
and cloud computing, has become one of a major discussion thread in the IT world in the recent few years. We developed an architecture that uses 
cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution 
can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, 
storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s status including CPU load, memory, and battery 
level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application. 
 
Keywords : Cloud computing, Mobile cloud computing (MCC), GPS, offloading, Partitioning and migration 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Together  with  an  explosive  growth  of  the  mobile  applications 
and emerging of cloud computing concept, mobile cloud com-
puting (MCC) has been introduced to be a potential technolo-
gy  for  mobile  services.  MCC  integrates  the  cloud  computing 
into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles related 
to the performance (e.g., battery life, storage, and bandwidth), 
environment,  and  security  (e.g.  Confidentiality,  reliability  and 
privacy) discussed in mobile computing. Mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphone, tablet pcs, etc) are increasingly have become the 
primary  computing  platform  for  many  users  [1,  2,  3].  Mobile 
users  accumulate  rich  experience  of  various  services  from 
mobile  applications  (e.g.,  iPhone  apps,  Google  apps,  etc), 
which  run  on  the  devices  and/or  on  remote  servers  via  wire-
less  networks. The  rapid  progress  of  mobile  computing  (MC) 
becomes a powerful trend in the development of IT technology 
as well as commerce and industry ﬁelds. However, the mobile 
devices  are  facing  many  challenges  in  their  resources  (e.g., 
battery  life,  storage,  and  bandwidth)  and  communications 
(e.g., mobility and security). The limited resources signiﬁcantly 
impede the improvement of service qualities. . Various studies 
have identified longer battery lifetime as the most desired fea-
ture of such systems .Cloud computing (CC) has been widely 
recognized  as  the  next  generation‟s  computing  infrastructure. 
CC  offers  some  advantages  by  allowing  users  to  use  infra-
structure  (e.g.,  servers,  networks,  and  storages),  platforms, 
and  software  (e.g.,  application  programs)  provided  by  cloud 
providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. 
In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in 
an on-demand  fashion [4, 5]. As a result, mobile applications 
can  be  rapidly  provisioned  and  released  with  the  minimal 
management efforts or service provider‟s interactions. With the 
explosion  of  mobile  applications  and  the  support  of  CC  for  a 
variety  of  services  for  mobile  users,  mobile  cloud  computing 
(MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into 
the  mobile  environment.  Mobile  cloud  computing  (Figure.1) 
brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to 

 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
present  cloud  computing  definitions  and  basic  terminology  of 
mobile  cloud  computing  and  its  architectures  Following  that, 
respectively in the next section the discussion of related work 
of mobile cloud computing.  Following that, respectively in the 
in  section  4  present  problem  definitions  and  system  model, 
and the description of partition cost module and the evaluation. 
Finally, the conclusion lies in the last section. 

2 OVERVIEW OF MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING 
In order to help us better understanding of Mobile Cloud Com-
puting,  let‟s  start  from  the  two  previous  techniques:  Mobile 
Computing  and  Cloud  Computing  followed  by  mobile  cloud

A. Mobile Computing 
Mobile  computing  exactly  is  described  as  a  form  of  human-
computer  interaction  by  which  a  computer  is  expected  to  be 
transported  during  normal  usage  [6,  7].  Mobile  computing  is 
based on a collection of three major concepts: hardware, soft-
ware  and  communication.  The  concepts  of  hardware  can  be 
considered  as  mobile  devices,  such  as  smartphone  and  lap-
top, or their mobile components. Software of mobile computing 
is  the  numerous  mobile  applications  in  the  devices,  such  as 
the mobile browser, anti-virus software and games. The com-
munication  issue  includes  the  infrastructure  of  mobile  net-
works, protocols and  data delivery in their use.it should have 
the following feature (mobility, Diversity of network conditions, 
frequent  disconnection  and  consistency,  Dis-symmetrical  net-
work communication, and Low reliability) 

 
• Current status of mobile applications 

 
Several  researchers,  [8,  9],  have  identified  the  fundamental 
challenges  in  mobile  computing.  Mobile  computing  environ-
ments are characterized by severe resources constraints and 
frequent changes in operating conditions. 

I.  Offline Applications: Fat Clients with presentation and 
business  logic  processed  locally.  In  offline  applica-
tions  data  downloaded  from  backend.  Its  advantag-
es(Well Integrated, Optimized Performance, Availabili-
ty  :even  without  network  connectivity).its  disadvan-
tages (No Portability, Complex  

II.  Online Applications: Online Applications: Only presen-
tation  layer  at  the  client. All  processing  done  online. 
Assume  constant  connectivity  with  backend.  Its  ad-
vantages: Multiplatform, Direct and Instantaneous Ac-
cessibility  to  better  services  and  its  disadvantages: 
Excessive  latency  for  real  time  responsiveness,  no 
access to device features, sometimes difficult to main-
tain sessions for a long time. 

 
B. Cloud Computing 
[10, 11, 12] Cloud computing refers to the hardware, systems 
software,  and  applications  delivered  as  services  over  the  In-
ternet (Fig.2). When a cloud is made available in a pay as you 
go manner to the general public, we call it a Public Cloud. The 
term  Private  Cloud  is  used  when  the  cloud  infrastructure  is 
operated solely for a business or an organization. A composi-
tion  of  the  two  types  (private  and  public)  is  called  a  Hybrid 
Cloud, where a private  cloud is able to maintain high service 
availability  by  scaling  up  their  system  with  externally  provi-
sioned  resources  from  a  public  cloud  when  there  are  rapid 
workload  fluctuations  or  hardware  failures.  In  general,  cloud 
providers fall into three categories  

• 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offering web-based 
access  to  storage  and  computing  power.  The  con-
sumer does not need to manage or control the under-
lying cloud infrastructure but has control over the op-
erating systems, storage, and deployed applications. 

•  Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  giving  developers  the 
tools to build and host web applications (e.g., APPRIO 
[13], software as a service provider, is built using the 

Force.com  [14]  platform  while  the  infrastructure  is 
provided by the Amazon Web Service [15]). The users 
host an environment for their applications. The users 
control the applications, but do not control the operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure, which 
they are using. 

•  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  where  the  consumer 
uses  an  application,  but  does  not  control  the  operat-
ing system, hardware or network infrastructure. In this 
situation,  the  user  steers  applications  over  the  net-
work.  Applications  that  are  accessible  from  various 
client devices through a thin client interface such as a 
web browser.

C. Mobile Cloud computing  
There  are  several  definitions  of  mobile  cloud  computing  [16, 
17],  and  different  research  refers  to  different  concepts  of  the 
„mobile cloud: 2  The  term  mobile  cloud  computing  means  to 
Mobile  Cloud  computing  a  combination  of  cloud  computing, 
wireless  infrastructure,  portable  devices,  and  location  based 
services  have  given  rise  to  it.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a 
model for transparent elastic augmentation of mobile device‟s 
capability.The  main  objective  of  mobile  cloud  computing  is  to 
provide  a  convenient  and  rapid  method  for  users  to  access 
and  receive  data  from  the  cloud,  such  convenient  and  rapid 
method  means  accessing  cloud  computing  resources  effec-
tively by using mobile devices. 
 
2 RELATED WORK 
To give more prospective about the Mobile Cloud Computing, 
this  section  discusses  the  results  obtained  from  other  re-
sources.  It  was  shown  in  [18]  executes  video  games  in  the 
cloud and delivers video stream to resource-poor clients with-
out  interrupting  the  game  experience.  Many  other  examples 
where  the  cloud  can  augment  mobile  devices  can  be  envi-
sioned,  e.g.  virus  scan,  mobile  file  system  indexing,  aug-
mented  reality  applications.  In  [19]  uses  VM  migration  to  of-
fload part of their application workload to a resourceful server 
through either 3G or WiFi. CloneCloud(Fig.3) was tested using 
Android  phones  with  the  clones  executing  on  a  Dell  desktop 
running Ubuntu. The system is a flexible application partitioned 
and  execution  runtime.  It  enables  unmodified  mobile  applica-
tions to offload part of their execution from mobile devices onto 
device clones operating in a computational cloud.

For our experiment, we calculate the effects of Sending com-
putation to cloud web service and back with results and study-
ing the Offloading computation to save energy on power con-
sumption  for  smartphone  mobile  in  case  of  running  all 
processes of application on mobile or by partition and offload-
ing processes to cloud  

 

In  first  step:  Firstly;  Comparison  is  conducted  using  two 
different  types  of  GPS  mode  (using  mobile  GPS),  and  using 
mobile network .for each type of GPS, we can get latitude and 
longitude for  each  point  (it  can  be  calculated  by  mobile  GPS 
satellite or by mobile network)  
 
In second step: After selecting GPS mode of operations, we 
have  to  choose  between  manual  or  automatic  calculation  to 
get latitude or longitude for each point 

 

 

If automatic calculation is selected,  we have to enter 
number  of  points  and  system  get  points  every  thirty 
second  
If  manual  calculation  is  selected,  we  have  to  click  to 
get points  

 
In  third  step:  After  selecting  method  to  get  points  either 
manually or automatic, we have to choose between calculation 
way on mobile or by partition and offloading to perform part of 
calculation on mobile and part on cloud server  
 
a) 

In  case  calculation  on  mobile, calculation is conducted 
in case of getting points manually or automatic Mobile Ap-
plication  will  take  GPS  reading  and  perform  calculations 
over certain period of time  

1.  GPS  reading  to  determine  latitude  and  longitude 
for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone (satellite) ) or from mobile network  

2.  Then calculate the distance between two point or 

more using different algorithms 

3.  The  Application  will  perform  all  calculations  on 
smart phone device and calculate the results and 
the  consuming  resources  such  as  Memory  con-
sumed, CPU usage, Time consumed for calcula-
tion, battery consumed to perform the processes, 
time  consumed  for  calculations  and  for  getting 
points 

In  case  of  partition  and  offloading  calculation  on 
cloud and mobile, We implement cloud clone application 
that  enables  the  mobile  applications  developers  to  take 
decision of performing all application processes on an an-
droid mobile device or to divide the application processes 
to execute on mobile & cloud

for  each  point  either  by  GPS  for  mobile  (smart 
phone  (satellite)  )  or  from  mobile  network  (this 
step execute on mobile device ) 

2.  Then data(longitude and latitude for each point) is 
transmitted to cloud server to perform calculation

3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM MODEL 
In  this  section,  we  present  a  model  for  application  execution 
on  the  cloud-assisted  mobile  application  platform. Application 
system architecture as shown  in Fig.5 First, we define a mo-
bile  application  profile.  Then,  we  calculate  consuming  re-
sources  for  application  execution,  including  resources  con-
sumed  for  computation  on  mobile  execution  and  a  transmis-
sion computation to cloud execution. The following Sequence 
steps  for  our  framework  application  as  shown  in  (fig  6)  .We 
use  a  mobile  smartphone  SAMSUNG  GALAXY  GRAND  1.2 
GHz  Dual  Core  CPU,  and  Android  4  Operating  Systems  in 
which performance data is collected and tested. In the experi-
ments,  the  GPSTestPerformance  application  smartphone  cal-
culate  some  of  GPS  calculations  such  as  distance  between 
two  points  or  more  till  100  points  using  different  algorithms.

4.1.1 Distance using Haversine formula 
for  our  experiment,distance  calculations  between  two  point 
using  the  „haversine‟  formula  to  calculate  the  great-circle  dis-
tance between two points – that is, the shortest distance over 
the  earth‟s  surface  .The  formula  assumes  that  the earth  is  a 
sphere, (we know that it is "ellipse " shaped)  –  giving  an  „as-
the-crow-flies‟  distance  between  the  points  (ignoring  any  hills, 
of course!).

Δφ is latitude difference (lat2− lat1), Δλ is longitude difference

4.1.2 Distance using Spherical low of Cosines: 
When Sinnott published the haversine formula, computational 
precision  was  limited.  Nowadays,  most  modern  computers  & 
languages use IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point numbers, which 
provide 15 significant figures of precision. With this precision, 
the  simple spherical 
law  of  cosines formula  gives  well-
conditioned  results  down  to  distances  as  small  as  around  1 
metre

- According to partition algorithm, most of resources consumed 
on  mobile  smartphone  will  decrease  to  approximately  to  half 
as shown in fig 11. in case of partition and offloading applica-
tion  most  of  resources  consumed  on  cloud  and  minimize  the

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed the elastic partition algorithm and 
partition  cost  module.  Sending  computation  to  another  ma-
chine is a good idea. Thus, cloud computing can save energy 
for mobile users through computation offloading. Virtualization, 
a  fundamental  feature  in  cloud  computing,  lets  applications 
from  different  customers  run  on  different  virtual  machines, 
thereby  providing  separation  and  protection.  The  advantages 
of Mobile Cloud Computing: Cloud computing can be a prom-
ising solution for mobile computing due to many reasons (e.g., 
mobility,  communication,  and  portability  so  that  cloud  can  be 
used  to  overcome  obstacles  in  mobile  computing,  thereby 
pointing out advantages of MCC. Mobile cloud computing can 
extending battery lifetime (Battery is one of the main concerns 
for  mobile  devices).  And  can  reduce  power  consumption  for 
mobile  devices.  these  solutions  require  changes  in  the struc-
ture  of  mobile  devices,  and  mobile  application  .Computation 
ofﬂoading technique is proposed with the objective to migrate 
the  large  computations  and  complex  processing  from  re-
source-limited  devices  (i.e.,  mobile  devices)  to  resourceful 
machines  (i.e.,  servers  in  clouds).  This  avoids  taking  a  long 
application execution time on mobile devices which results in 
large amount of power consumption. The results demonstrate 
that  the  remote  application  execution  can  save  energy 
signiﬁcantly  In  mobile  cloud  computing,  application  offloading 
is  implemented  as  a  software  level  solution  for  augmenting 
computing capabilities of smart mobile devices. In this paper, 
we  present  a  survey  of  the  energy-efficient  technologies  in 
mobile  cloud  computing,  provide  the  definitions  and  architec-
tural designs of MCC. We summarize related works in energy-
efficient  wireless  transmission. We  believe  that  there  are  still 
great  opportunities  for  researchers  to  make  ground-breaking 
contributions  in  this  field,  thus  bringing  significant  impacts  to 
the development in the industry. We hope our work will provide 
a  better  understanding  of  design  challenges  surrounding  en-

ergy-efficient MCC
