Summary 
Cloud  computing  is  an  emerging  infrastructure  paradigm  that 
allows  efficient  maintenance  of  cloud  with  efficient  uses  of 
servers. Virtualization is a key element in cloud environment as it 
provides  distribution  of  computing  resources.  This  distribution 
results  in  cost  and  energy  reduction,  thus  making  efficient 
utilization of physical resources. Thus resource sharing and use 
of  virtualization  allows  improved  performance  for  demanding 
scientific  computing  workloads.  Number  of  data  centers  and 
physical servers are underutilized so they are used inefficiently. 
So  performance  evaluation  and  its  enhancement  in  virtualized 
environment  like  public  and  private  cloud  are  the  challenging 
issues. Performance of cloud environment is dependent on CPU 
& memory utilization, Network and I/O disk operations. In order 
to  improve  the  performance  of  the  virtualization  with  cloud 
computing, one of the solutions is to allow highly available data 
in  the  cluster  form.  Thus  replicas  are  available  at  each  data 
centers and are highly available.  In  the  proposed  work,  the  I/O 
parameters  are  chosen  for  increasing  the  performance  in  this 
domain.  This  enhancement  can  be  achieved

1. Introduction 

For  many  computational  applications,  large  numbers  of 
resources are needed and this utilization of resources is for 
long  period  of  time.  Cloud  computing,  which  is  an 
emerging  technology,  provides  the  proper  hosting  of 
resources  by  leasing  them  from  huge  data  centers  only 
when  they  are  needed.  Cloud  computing  is  replacing  all 
existing  technologies  by  offering  their  customer  to  pay 
only what they use. For example, an organization can buy 
any software or service for required period of time on the 
cloud rather than to purchase a machine for that purpose. It 
offers  infrastructure,  platform,  software  and  data  as 
services  and  these  are  subscription  based  services  means 
pay-as-you-go  model  (C.  Pelletingeas,  2010  [4]).  These 
services  are  known  as  Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),

platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS) 
and data as a service (DaaS) respectively. Infrastructure as 
a  service  ensures  processing,  storage,  network  and  other 
fundamental  computing  resources  to  the  users.  Examples 
of IaaS based services are Amazon EC2, IBM`s Blue cloud, 
Eucalyptus, Rackspace Cloud etc. the platform as a service 
gives  a  high  level  integrated  environment  to  build,  test, 
deploy  and  host  customer  created  applications.  Examples 
of  PaaS  based  services  are  Google  App  Engine,  Engine 
Yard,  Heroku  etc.  Software  as  a  service  is  a  software 
delivery  model  in  that  the  applications  are  accessed  by 
simple interface like web browser over Internet. Examples 
of  SaaS  based  services  are  Web  Mail,  Google  Docs, 
Facebook  etc  (G.Malathy  et  al  [1]).  Data  as  a  service 
provides  an  infrastructure  for  web  scale  data  mining  and 
knowledge discovery in order to empower the applications 
and services with intelligence. 
Cloud  computing  models  such  as  public,  private, 
community  and  hybrid  models  can  be  implemented  by 
using virtualization. Virtualization is the virtual evaluation 
of  computing  elements  like  hardware,  software,  memory, 
storage, network and so on (C. Pelletingeas, 2010 [4]). It 
allows  the  sharing  of  physical  resources  and  higher 
utilization  rate  with  optimal  storage.  It  also  reduces  the 
power  consumption  and  hardware 
investment  and 
improves the system management without extra cost. 
Thus  cloud 
that  offers 
infrastructure, platform, software and data as services. So 
many  researches  are  being  made  for  improving  these 
flavors  of  services.  But  the  dark  side  of  using  this 
virtualization  is  degradation  of  performance  due  to  extra 
overhead.  CPU  usage,  memory,  storage  and  network  are 
the  performance  factors  for  cloud  computing.  Since  fast 
accessing  of  data  and  resources  is  highly  demanded  in 
cloud  environment.  Any  organization  adopting  cloud 
computing  certainly  expect 
the  kind  of  enhanced 
performance.  But  this  performance  is  degraded  due  to 
limited bandwidth, high response time, inefficient CPU & 
memory utilization, scalability bottleneck and unnecessary 
use of data centers.  
I/O virtualization  poses  a  more  difficult  problem  because 
I/O  devices  are  shared  among  all  virtual  machines.  It

requires a privilege domain from guest VMs to access I/O. 
This  intervention  leads  to  longer  I/O  latency  and  higher 
CPU overhead due to context switches between the guest 
VMS and VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). Performance 
of  cloud  computing  is  also  dependent  on  the  underlying 
cloud  infrastructure.  This  work  is  aimed  to  address 
different  issues  that  are  responsible  for  improving  the 
performance of cloud computing. 

2. Literature Survey 

In  the  context  of  cloud  computing,  Different  researches 
have  been  made  for  performance  enhancement.  Various 
solutions  are  proposed  for  improving  the  performance  of 
cloud  computing.  Thus  previous  works 
related 
to 
performance improvement are reviewed in this section: 
IOSUP  et  al  [4]  has  proposed  performance  analysis  of 
cloud  computing  services  for  Many  Task  scientific 
Computing  (MTC).  MTC  based  computing  requires 
resources  to  be  leased  from  big  data  centers  only  when 
they  are  needed.  It  is  obtained  that  existing  cloud 
technologies  are  insufficient  for  scientific  computing  but 
they  may  be  still  good  solution  for  those  that  required 
resources instantly and temporarily. 
Donglai  Zhang  et  al  [2]  proposed  WSDF  framework  for 
improved  data 
transfer  performance  of  web  service 
workflows.  This  framework  allows  directly  data  sharing 
between  consecutive  web  services  within  a  web  service 
workflow. Thus it allows improved performance and better 
data  transfer  speed  between  different  components  of  a 
workflow. 
Wei  Huang  et  al  [3]  proposed  a  framework  for 
performance  and  management  overheads  with  virtual 
machines.  Two  cases  are  considered:  one  is  Virtual 
Machine Monitor (VMM) bypass  I/O  and  another  is  VM 
image  management.  VMM  bypass  I/O  extends  the  OS 
bypass feature of modern high speed interconnects such as 
InfiniBand and VM image management is done with three 
aspects:  Customizing  small  kernels,  developing  fast  and 
scalable  distribution  schemes  for  large  scale  clusters  and 
VM image caching on computing nodes. Both these cases 
are having significant performance with VMs. 
 Joyent  et  al  [8]  has  introduced  Smart  technologies  for 
technologies  offer 
cloud  performance.  These  Smart 
enhanced  performance  with  scalability, 
light  weight 
virtualization, flexible resource provisioning, dynamic load 
balancing, storage caching and CPU bursting. 
Scalability of cloud environment can be improved from its 
SmartOS  operating  system,  SmartMachine  virtualization 
technology,  SmartDataCenter  infrastructure  management 
system  to  its  smartPlatform  development  environment. 
According  to  Joyent,  scalability  is  the  best  solution  to 
increase the performance of cloud computing environment. 

3. Problems Perceived in this Area 

It  is  difficult  to  match  a  good  definition  of  cloud 
computing due to lack of standardization  and  economical 
impact.    Standardizations  of  reliability  and  security  are 
main concern now- a- days. Because these issues are facing 
daily new challenges. As cloud computing is an on demand 
service  that  shares  a  pool  of  resources  over  the  network. 
Thus cloud security and reliability to its users are the major 
issues to be researched in this area and both of them make 
it hard to understand.  
In  other  hand,  economical  impact  of  cloud  allows  that 
resources  could  be  used  in  more  efficient  and  intelligent 
ways  by  reducing  the  cost.  This  can  be  achieved  by 
virtualization because it requires less storage space of the 
servers and also reduction of power consumption.  
Latency  and  interoperability  are  also  major  issues  to  be 
solved  in  cloud  computing  because  their  causes  are 
engineered into the cloud platforms themselves.  
One of the most important issues in cloud computing is the 
performance  overhead.  Since  fast  accessing  of  data  and 
resources  is  highly  demanded  in  cloud  environment.  Any 
organization  adopting  cloud  computing  certainly  expect 
the kind of enhanced performance. But this performance is 
degraded  due  to  limited  bandwidth,  high  response  time, 
inefficient  CPU  &  memory  utilization, 
scalability 
bottleneck and unnecessary use of data centers.  
I/O virtualization  poses  a  more  difficult  problem  because 
I/O  devices  are  shared  among  all  virtual.  It  requires  a 
privilege  domain  from  guest  VMs  to  access  I/O.  This 
intervention  leads  to  longer  I/O  latency  and  higher  CPU 
overhead due to context switches between the guest VMS 
and  VMM  (Virtual  Machine  Monitor).  Performance  of 
cloud computing is also dependent on the underlying cloud 
infrastructure. 

4. Proposed Methodology 

Performance  is  the  major  concern  in  the  field  of  cloud 
computing.  People  are  running  into  the  scalability.  But 
increasing number of Virtual machine and CPU is not the 
key solution for scalability, because cost is another issue to 
be  researched  then.  So  the  area  which  is  identified  for 
improving the performance is to avoid the unnecessary use 
of databases. Data centers are highly loaded for accessing 
I/O requests. Although operations on huge amount of data 
in  cloud  computing  are  quite  complex  and  lead  to  be 
performance  overheads.  There  may  be  a  case  of  server 
failure.  So  from 
the  development,  maintenance  and 
performance perspective, all these can be serious issues to 
be refined. One of the solutions is to allow highly available 
data in the cluster form. Thus replicas are available at each 
data centers and are highly available. In our work, the I/O

performance perspective, all these can be serious issues to 
be refined. One of the solutions is to allow highly available 
data in the cluster form. Thus replicas are available at each 
data centers and are highly available. In our work, the I/O

to  minimize 

for  performance  enhancement 

these 
technologies 
that  move  among 

parameters  are  chosen  for  increasing  the  performance  in 
this  domain.  This  enhancement  can  be  achieved  through 
the clustering and caching technologies.  
Cluster  based  data  centers  are  highly  efficient  for 
performing  I/O  operations.  Clusters  can  be  defined  as 
collection of virtual data servers and are treated as a single 
machine.  Clustering  avoids  uninterrupted  access  to  data 
and also helps when network or storage connectivity is lost. 
Caching, in other hand, prevents over hits to the databases. 
Network  caching  and  VM  image  caching  are  the  two 
aspects  that  are  proposed  for  this  purpose.  Thus  the  idea 
is 
behind  both 
the 
information 
the  different  cloud 
components. 
Although clustering can be done at different level such as 
OS level, Application level, web server level and database 
level.  Clustering  among  the  data  centers  that  are  located 
throughout  the  world,  allow  highly  available  data  for 
customers  without  any  delay.  Thus  if  one  data  center  is 
goes  down,  everything  in  the  second  data  center  is 
clustered with the first, so there is no problem for the time 
being.  And  you  still  have  database/web/app  server  in  the 
second data center.  
In the favour of our work several issues are identified for 
better  performance  of  cloud  services.  In  some  previous 
studies  it  is  established  that  clustering  can  be  a  key 
contributing  factor  to  improve  the  performance  in  cloud 
computing. 
G.Malathy  et  al  [1]  proposed  the  Reservation  Cluster 
approach 
in  cloud 
computing.  The  concept  of  reservation  cluster  is  to 
schedule  the  tasks.  Unscheduled  tasks  are  sent  to  the 
reservation  cluster  and  in  this  cluster  all  the  tasks  are 
scheduled simultaneously without any iteration. It reduces 
the  amount  of  computation  time  and  resource  usage  and 
allows better performance. 
A.Mahendiran  et  al  [10]  proposed  the  implementation  of 
K-Means clustering algorithm in cloud computing for large 
data sets. The work was focused to implement and deploy 
K-Means  algorithm  in  Google  Cloud  using  Google  App 
Engine  with  cloud  SQL.  Thus  cloud  computing  allows 
mining of large databases and storing them with less cost.  
Results show that clustering works well in the cloud. 
Since cloud is having the large data sets and these data sets 
are  regularly  accessed  as  per  user  requirements.  Michael 
Shindler  et  al  [11]  have  proposed  fast  and  accurate  k 
means algorithm as a solution where the data is too large 
and  must  be  accessed  sequentially.  BigCross  dataset  and 
census 1990 dataset were considered as large data sets for 
applying  the  proposed  clustering  algorithm.  Experiments 
show the significant results in terms of cost and response 
time. 
P.  Ashok  et  al  [12]  has  proposed  renovated  k-means 
algorithm for Iris and Wine datasets. Proposed algorithm is 

compared  with  K-means,  static  weighted  K-means  and 
Dynamic  weighted  K-means  on  three  different  distance 
function. Less execution time and minimum iteration count 
of proposed k- means help to improve the performance. 
Karedla, R. Et al[13] has proposed  the  caching  strategies 
to increase the system response time and  data  throughput 
of  the  disk.  Results  show  that  caching  offers  the  twise 
performance of its size.  
Q. Luo et al [14] has proposed the Active Query Caching 
for improving scalability of database web servers. It allows 
the load sharing of database in order to reduce the network 
traffic.  This  caching 
level  for 
simplifying  query  containment  checking  and  query 
evaluation  at  the  proxy.  This  query  level  caching  allows 
fast  response  to  the  user  queries  and  hence  improve  the 
web server performance. Proposed architecture stack using 
clustering is shown in figure: 
 

is  applied  at  query 

 
Fig1: Architecture for cloud computing using Clustering 

Proposed  clustering  and  caching 
technologies  are 
integrated at the physical level where the data servers are 
located.  Thus  clusters  of  data  centers  are  formed  at  this 
level.  And  abstract  level  (i.e.  virtualization  layer)  is 
responsible  for  load  sharing  among  the  datacenters.  In 
order  to  scale  the  performance  of  data  centers,  a  pool  of 
data  centers  tied  together  to  act  as  a  single  unit  called 
cluster.  These  clustering  technologies  are  transparent  to 
client applications. Clustering and caching techniques can 
be seemed a better solutions for fast accessing of data and 
I/O operations. In this way, proposed methods for reducing 
data traffic and also minimizing the database hits can have 
better  performance  than  cloud  environments  that  are  not 
using clustering of data centres. 

5. Conclusion 

Performance  of  virtualization  with  cloud  computing  is  a 
major  issue  to  be  researched.  Poor  performance  can  lack 
the  interest  of  customers.  Clustering  and  caching  are  the 
proposed methodologies for improving the performance in

Summary 
Cloud  computing  is  an  emerging  infrastructure  paradigm  that 
allows  efficient  maintenance  of  cloud  with  efficient  uses  of 
servers. Virtualization is a key element in cloud environment as it 
provides  distribution  of  computing  resources.  This  distribution 
results  in  cost  and  energy  reduction,  thus  making  efficient 
utilization of physical resources. Thus resource sharing and use 
of  virtualization  allows  improved  performance  for  demanding 
scientific  computing  workloads.  Number  of  data  centers  and 
physical servers are underutilized so they are used inefficiently. 
So  performance  evaluation  and  its  enhancement  in  virtualized 
environment  like  public  and  private  cloud  are  the  challenging 
issues. Performance of cloud environment is dependent on CPU 
& memory utilization, Network and I/O disk operations. In order 
to  improve  the  performance  of  the  virtualization  with  cloud 
computing, one of the solutions is to allow highly available data 
in  the  cluster  form.  Thus  replicas  are  available  at  each  data 
centers and are highly available.  In  the  proposed  work,  the  I/O 
parameters  are  chosen  for  increasing  the  performance  in  this 
domain.  This  enhancement  can  be  achieved 
the 
clustering  and  caching  technologies.  The  use  of  technology  for 
data  centers  clustering

performance  and  scalability  can  be  improved  by  reducing  the

1. Introduction 

For  many  computational  applications,  large  numbers  of 
resources are needed and this utilization of resources is for 
long  period  of  time.  Cloud  computing,  which  is  an 
emerging  technology,  provides  the  proper  hosting  of 
resources  by  leasing  them  from  huge  data  centers  only 
when  they  are  needed.  Cloud  computing  is  replacing  all 
existing  technologies  by  offering  their  customer  to  pay 
only what they use. For example, an organization can buy 
any software or service for required period of time on the 
cloud rather than to purchase a machine for that purpose. It 
offers  infrastructure,  platform,  software  and  data  as 
services  and  these  are  subscription  based  services  means 
pay-as-you-go  model  (C.  Pelletingeas,  2010  [4]).  These 
services  are  known  as  Infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),

platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS) 
and data as a service (DaaS) respectively. Infrastructure as 
a  service  ensures  processing,  storage,  network  and  other 
fundamental  computing  resources  to  the  users.  Examples 
of IaaS based services are Amazon EC2, IBM`s Blue cloud, 
Eucalyptus, Rackspace Cloud etc. the platform as a service 
gives  a  high  level  integrated  environment  to  build,  test, 
deploy  and  host  customer  created  applications.  Examples 
of  PaaS  based  services  are  Google  App  Engine,  Engine 
Yard,  Heroku  etc.  Software  as  a  service  is  a  software 
delivery  model  in  that  the  applications  are  accessed  by 
simple interface like web browser over Internet. Examples 
of  SaaS  based  services  are  Web  Mail,  Google  Docs, 
Facebook  etc  (G.Malathy  et  al  [1]).  Data  as  a  service 
provides  an  infrastructure  for  web  scale  data  mining  and 
knowledge discovery in order to empower the applications 
and services with intelligence. 
Cloud  computing  models  such  as  public,  private, 
community  and  hybrid  models  can  be  implemented  by 
using virtualization. Virtualization is the virtual evaluation 
of  computing  elements  like  hardware,  software,  memory, 
storage, network and so on (C. Pelletingeas, 2010 [4]). It 
allows  the  sharing  of  physical  resources  and  higher 
utilization  rate  with  optimal  storage.  It  also  reduces  the 
power  consumption  and  hardware 
investment  and 
improves the system management without extra cost. 
Thus  cloud 
that  offers 
infrastructure, platform, software and data as services. So 
many  researches  are  being  made  for  improving  these 
flavors  of  services.  But  the  dark  side  of  using  this 
virtualization  is  degradation  of  performance  due  to  extra 
overhead.  CPU  usage,  memory,  storage  and  network  are 
the  performance  factors  for  cloud  computing.  Since  fast 
accessing  of  data  and  resources  is  highly  demanded  in 
cloud  environment.  Any  organization  adopting  cloud 
computing  certainly  expect 
the  kind  of  enhanced 
performance.  But  this  performance  is  degraded  due  to 
limited bandwidth, high response time, inefficient CPU & 
memory utilization, scalability bottleneck and unnecessary 
use of data centers.  
I/O virtualization  poses  a  more  difficult  problem  because 
I/O  devices  are  shared  among  all  virtual  machines.  It 

is  a  package  of  services 

38

requires a privilege domain from guest VMs to access I/O. 
This  intervention  leads  to  longer  I/O  latency  and  higher 
CPU overhead due to context switches between the guest 
VMS and VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). Performance 
of  cloud  computing  is  also  dependent  on  the  underlying 
cloud  infrastructure.  This  work  is  aimed  to  address 
different  issues  that  are  responsible  for  improving  the 
performance of cloud computing. 

2. Literature Survey 

In  the  context  of  cloud  computing,  Different  researches 
have  been  made  for  performance  enhancement.  Various 
solutions  are  proposed  for  improving  the  performance  of 
cloud  computing.  Thus  previous  works 
related 
to 
performance improvement are reviewed in this section: 
IOSUP  et  al  [4]  has  proposed  performance  analysis  of 
cloud  computing  services  for  Many  Task  scientific 
Computing  (MTC).  MTC  based  computing  requires 
resources  to  be  leased  from  big  data  centers  only  when 
they  are  needed.  It  is  obtained  that  existing  cloud 
technologies  are  insufficient  for  scientific  computing  but 
they  may  be  still  good  solution  for  those  that  required 
resources instantly and temporarily. 
Donglai  Zhang  et  al  [2]  proposed  WSDF  framework  for 
improved  data 
transfer  performance  of  web  service 
workflows.  This  framework  allows  directly  data  sharing 
between  consecutive  web  services  within  a  web  service 
workflow. Thus it allows improved performance and better 
data  transfer  speed  between  different  components  of  a 
workflow. 
Wei  Huang  et  al  [3]  proposed  a  framework  for 
performance  and  management  overheads  with  virtual 
machines.  Two  cases  are  considered:  one  is  Virtual 
Machine Monitor (VMM) bypass  I/O  and  another  is  VM 
image  management.  VMM  bypass  I/O  extends  the  OS 
bypass feature of modern high speed interconnects such as 
InfiniBand and VM image management is done with three 
aspects:  Customizing  small  kernels,  developing  fast  and 
scalable  distribution  schemes  for  large  scale  clusters  and 
VM image caching on computing nodes. Both these cases 
are having significant performance with VMs. 
 Joyent  et  al  [8]  has  introduced  Smart  technologies  for 
technologies  offer 
cloud  performance.  These  Smart 
enhanced  performance  with  scalability, 
light  weight 
virtualization, flexible resource provisioning, dynamic load 
balancing, storage caching and CPU bursting. 
Scalability of cloud environment can be improved from its 
SmartOS  operating  system,  SmartMachine  virtualization 
technology,  SmartDataCenter  infrastructure  management 
system  to  its  smartPlatform  development  environment. 
According  to  Joyent,  scalability  is  the  best  solution  to 
increase the performance of cloud computing environment. 

3. Problems Perceived in this Area 

It  is  difficult  to  match  a  good  definition  of  cloud 
computing due to lack of standardization  and  economical 
impact.    Standardizations  of  reliability  and  security  are 
main concern now- a- days. Because these issues are facing 
daily new challenges. As cloud computing is an on demand 
service  that  shares  a  pool  of  resources  over  the  network. 
Thus cloud security and reliability to its users are the major 
issues to be researched in this area and both of them make 
it hard to understand.  
In  other  hand,  economical  impact  of  cloud  allows  that 
resources  could  be  used  in  more  efficient  and  intelligent 
ways  by  reducing  the  cost.  This  can  be  achieved  by 
virtualization because it requires less storage space of the 
servers and also reduction of power consumption.  
Latency  and  interoperability  are  also  major  issues  to  be 
solved  in  cloud  computing  because  their  causes  are 
engineered into the cloud platforms themselves.  
One of the most important issues in cloud computing is the 
performance  overhead.  Since  fast  accessing  of  data  and 
resources  is  highly  demanded  in  cloud  environment.  Any 
organization  adopting  cloud  computing  certainly  expect 
the kind of enhanced performance. But this performance is 
degraded  due  to  limited  bandwidth,  high  response  time, 
inefficient  CPU  &  memory  utilization, 
scalability 
bottleneck and unnecessary use of data centers.  
I/O virtualization  poses  a  more  difficult  problem  because 
I/O  devices  are  shared  among  all  virtual.  It  requires  a 
privilege  domain  from  guest  VMs  to  access  I/O.  This 
intervention  leads  to  longer  I/O  latency  and  higher  CPU 
overhead due to context switches between the guest VMS 
and  VMM  (Virtual  Machine  Monitor).  Performance  of 
cloud computing is also dependent on the underlying cloud 
infrastructure. 

4. Proposed Methodology 

Performance  is  the  major  concern  in  the  field  of  cloud 
computing.  People  are  running  into  the  scalability.  But 
increasing number of Virtual machine and CPU is not the 
key solution for scalability, because cost is another issue to 
be  researched  then.  So  the  area  which  is  identified  for 
improving the performance is to avoid the unnecessary use 
of databases. Data centers are highly loaded for accessing 
I/O requests. Although operations on huge amount of data 
in  cloud  computing  are  quite  complex  and  lead  to  be 
performance  overheads.  There  may  be  a  case  of  server 
failure.  So  from 
the  development,  maintenance  and 
performance perspective, all these can be serious issues to 
be refined. One of the solutions is to allow highly available 
data in the cluster form. Thus replicas are available at each 
data centers and are highly available. In our work, the I/O

to  minimize 

for  performance  enhancement 

these 
technologies 
that  move  among 

parameters  are  chosen  for  increasing  the  performance  in 
this  domain.  This  enhancement  can  be  achieved  through 
the clustering and caching technologies.  
Cluster  based  data  centers  are  highly  efficient  for 
performing  I/O  operations.  Clusters  can  be  defined  as 
collection of virtual data servers and are treated as a single 
machine.  Clustering  avoids  uninterrupted  access  to  data 
and also helps when network or storage connectivity is lost. 
Caching, in other hand, prevents over hits to the databases. 
Network  caching  and  VM  image  caching  are  the  two 
aspects  that  are  proposed  for  this  purpose.  Thus  the  idea 
is 
behind  both 
the 
information 
the  different  cloud 
components. 
Although clustering can be done at different level such as 
OS level, Application level, web server level and database 
level.  Clustering  among  the  data  centers  that  are  located 
throughout  the  world,  allow  highly  available  data  for 
customers  without  any  delay.  Thus  if  one  data  center  is 
goes  down,  everything  in  the  second  data  center  is 
clustered with the first, so there is no problem for the time 
being.  And  you  still  have  database/web/app  server  in  the 
second data center.  
In the favour of our work several issues are identified for 
better  performance  of  cloud  services.  In  some  previous 
studies  it  is  established  that  clustering  can  be  a  key 
contributing  factor  to  improve  the  performance  in  cloud 
computing. 
G.Malathy  et  al  [1]  proposed  the  Reservation  Cluster 
approach 
in  cloud 
computing.  The  concept  of  reservation  cluster  is  to 
schedule  the  tasks.  Unscheduled  tasks  are  sent  to  the 
reservation  cluster  and  in  this  cluster  all  the  tasks  are 
scheduled simultaneously without any iteration. It reduces 
the  amount  of  computation  time  and  resource  usage  and 
allows better performance. 
A.Mahendiran  et  al  [10]  proposed  the  implementation  of 
K-Means clustering algorithm in cloud computing for large 
data sets. The work was focused to implement and deploy 
K-Means  algorithm  in  Google  Cloud  using  Google  App 
Engine  with  cloud  SQL.  Thus  cloud  computing  allows 
mining of large databases and storing them with less cost.  
Results show that clustering works well in the cloud. 
Since cloud is having the large data sets and these data sets 
are  regularly  accessed  as  per  user  requirements.  Michael 
Shindler  et  al  [11]  have  proposed  fast  and  accurate  k 
means algorithm as a solution where the data is too large 
and  must  be  accessed  sequentially.  BigCross  dataset  and 
census 1990 dataset were considered as large data sets for 
applying  the  proposed  clustering  algorithm.  Experiments 
show the significant results in terms of cost and response 
time. 
P.  Ashok  et  al  [12]  has  proposed  renovated  k-means 
algorithm for Iris and Wine datasets. Proposed algorithm is 

compared  with  K-means,  static  weighted  K-means  and 
Dynamic  weighted  K-means  on  three  different  distance 
function. Less execution time and minimum iteration count 
of proposed k- means help to improve the performance. 
Karedla, R. Et al[13] has proposed  the  caching  strategies 
to increase the system response time and  data  throughput 
of  the  disk.  Results  show  that  caching  offers  the  twise 
performance of its size.  
Q. Luo et al [14] has proposed the Active Query Caching 
for improving scalability of database web servers. It allows 
the load sharing of database in order to reduce the network 
traffic.  This  caching 
level  for 
simplifying  query  containment  checking  and  query 
evaluation  at  the  proxy.  This  query  level  caching  allows 
fast  response  to  the  user  queries  and  hence  improve  the 
web server performance. Proposed architecture stack using 
clustering is shown in figure: 
 

is  applied  at  query 

 
Fig1: Architecture for cloud computing using Clustering 

Proposed  clustering  and  caching 
technologies  are 
integrated at the physical level where the data servers are 
located.  Thus  clusters  of  data  centers  are  formed  at  this 
level.  And  abstract  level  (i.e.  virtualization  layer)  is 
responsible  for  load  sharing  among  the  datacenters.  In 
order  to  scale  the  performance  of  data  centers,  a  pool  of 
data  centers  tied  together  to  act  as  a  single  unit  called 
cluster.  These  clustering  technologies  are  transparent  to 
client applications. Clustering and caching techniques can 
be seemed a better solutions for fast accessing of data and 
I/O operations. In this way, proposed methods for reducing 
data traffic and also minimizing the database hits can have 
better  performance  than  cloud  environments  that  are  not 
using clustering of data centres. 

5. Conclusion 

Performance  of  virtualization  with  cloud  computing  is  a 
major  issue  to  be  researched.  Poor  performance  can  lack 
the  interest  of  customers.  Clustering  and  caching  are  the 
proposed methodologies for improving the performance in

these  technologies  have  their  own 
this  work.  Both 
significant. Clustering of data centers, network caching and 
VM  image  caching  are  the  key  points  that  are  used  as 
performance parameters. Expected results can have better 
performance than existing one.
