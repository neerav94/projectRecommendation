1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012).

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.

telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture.

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall

computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu,

providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The

2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in

and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud

scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been

Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine 
31 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

to  be  compromised  is  to  be  taken  into  account  (Arshad,  Townsend  &  Xu,  2013).  Some  authors 
have argued that using Internet technologies is not a must for cloud computing (Khorshed et al., 
2012) - but the cost efficiency  and globalization trends  will enforce and motivate almost all the 
businesses to admit Internet and associated technologies to be the ultimate means towards cloud 
computing  approach.  As  a  result,  total  Internet  related  security  concerns  are  anticipated  to  be 
automatically added on top of the cloud-specific security issues. Bringing portability is one of the 
means to make cloud services flexible. The portability of cloud services would also be associated 
with security concerns. Cloud portability enables the cloud users to switch among different cloud 
service  providers  without  being  affected  with  the  necessity  to  change  the  ways  to  accomplish 
tasks in different ways. It is a clear provision on bargaining power for the cloud users; but at the 
same  time,  the  security  issues  with  cloud  portability  are  to  be  counted.  Cloud  portability  might 
bring severe degree of API based security threats (Petcu, Macariu, Panica & Craciun, 2013).  
 
The  wide  transition  to  mobile  computing  practices  in  recent  years  has  made  it  imperative  to 
include mobile computing and its associated technologies as an essential part of cloud computing. 
Resource scarcity as well as other constraints of mobile computing is barriers to cloud computing.  
The  demand  of  huge  data  processing  is  a  problem  for  mobile  end-user  devices  which  has  been 
further  complemented  by  the  security  concerns  of  mobile  cloud  computing.  For  mobile  cloud 
computing,  the  device  level  limitations  has  inspired  researchers  to  suggest  the  inclusion  of 
another level of cloud termed  as ‘mobile cloud’  to aid the processing of the  specific computing 
and  processing  for  mobile  computing  devices  (Fernando,  Loke  &  Rahayu,  2013).  The  earlier 
explained  broadcast  nature  of  satellite  communication  and  related  security  issues  are  equally 
applicable to the mobile cloud computing due to its being wireless communication. Besides, the 
addition of mobile cloud into the perspective would add another cloud with all its security issues 
for a service provider having both mobile cloud and conventional cloud. The addition of mobile 
cloud  in  the  scenario  would  boost  performance,  but  it  would  also  add  another  layer  of  security 
issue not only to the mobile  cloud users,  but  also to the total  infrastructure of  the  cloud service 
provider.  The  hierarchical  arrangement  of  cloud  computing  facilitates  different  level  of 
extensibility  for  the  cloud  users  with  varying  degree  of  associated  security  issues  (Che  et  al., 
2011). Security issues for cloud computing are described by some authors as an obvious one due 
to its nature. In a business model, the risks for the consumers are related to and dependent on the 
relevant  approaches  and  policies  of the  cloud  service  providers  the  consumers  are  dealing  with. 
Using cloud products or services may lead to security concerns for the consumers if they are not 
well aware with the type and particulars of the products or services they are to procure or to use in 
a cloud environment; this is also related to the cloud providers’ identity and reliability. One of the 
inherent problems in this context is that, the consumers might normally not be able to identify or 
foresee all the risks involved in the specific cloud transaction they are dealing with or involved in 
(Svantesson & Clarke, 2010).  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Cloud computing has enormous prospects, but the security threats embedded in cloud computing 
approach  are  directly  proportional  to  its  offered  advantages.  Cloud  computing  is  a  great 
opportunity and lucrative option both to the businesses and the attackers – either parties can have 
their own advantages from cloud computing. The vast possibilities of cloud computing cannot be 
ignored solely for the security issues reason – the ongoing investigation and research for robust, 
consistent  and  integrated  security  models  for  cloud  computing  could  be  the  only  path  of 
motivation.  The  security  issues  could  severely  affect  could  infrastructures.  Security  itself  is 
conceptualized  in  cloud  computing  infrastructure  as  a  distinct  layer  (Dukaric  &  Juric,  2013). 
Security for cloud computing environment is a non-compromising requirement. Cloud computing 
is  inevitable  to  become  the  ideal  (and  possibly  the  ultimate)  approach  to  business  computing 
though  the  security  barriers  along  with  other  issues  need  to  be  resolved  for  cloud  computing  to

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine 
31 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

to  be  compromised  is  to  be  taken  into  account  (Arshad,  Townsend  &  Xu,  2013).  Some  authors 
have argued that using Internet technologies is not a must for cloud computing (Khorshed et al., 
2012) - but the cost efficiency  and globalization trends  will enforce and motivate almost all the 
businesses to admit Internet and associated technologies to be the ultimate means towards cloud 
computing  approach.  As  a  result,  total  Internet  related  security  concerns  are  anticipated  to  be 
automatically added on top of the cloud-specific security issues. Bringing portability is one of the 
means to make cloud services flexible. The portability of cloud services would also be associated 
with security concerns. Cloud portability enables the cloud users to switch among different cloud 
service  providers  without  being  affected  with  the  necessity  to  change  the  ways  to  accomplish 
tasks in different ways. It is a clear provision on bargaining power for the cloud users; but at the 
same  time,  the  security  issues  with  cloud  portability  are  to  be  counted.  Cloud  portability  might 
bring severe degree of API based security threats (Petcu, Macariu, Panica & Craciun, 2013).  
 
The  wide  transition  to  mobile  computing  practices  in  recent  years  has  made  it  imperative  to 
include mobile computing and its associated technologies as an essential part of cloud computing. 
Resource scarcity as well as other constraints of mobile computing is barriers to cloud computing.  
The  demand  of  huge  data  processing  is  a  problem  for  mobile  end-user  devices  which  has  been 
further  complemented  by  the  security  concerns  of  mobile  cloud  computing.  For  mobile  cloud 
computing,  the  device  level  limitations  has  inspired  researchers  to  suggest  the  inclusion  of 
another level of cloud termed  as ‘mobile cloud’  to aid the processing of the  specific computing 
and  processing  for  mobile  computing  devices  (Fernando,  Loke  &  Rahayu,  2013).  The  earlier 
explained  broadcast  nature  of  satellite  communication  and  related  security  issues  are  equally 
applicable to the mobile cloud computing due to its being wireless communication. Besides, the 
addition of mobile cloud into the perspective would add another cloud with all its security issues 
for a service provider having both mobile cloud and conventional cloud. The addition of mobile 
cloud  in  the  scenario  would  boost  performance,  but  it  would  also  add  another  layer  of  security 
issue not only to the mobile  cloud users,  but  also to the total  infrastructure of  the  cloud service 
provider.  The  hierarchical  arrangement  of  cloud  computing  facilitates  different  level  of 
extensibility  for  the  cloud  users  with  varying  degree  of  associated  security  issues  (Che  et  al., 
2011). Security issues for cloud computing are described by some authors as an obvious one due 
to its nature. In a business model, the risks for the consumers are related to and dependent on the 
relevant  approaches  and  policies  of the  cloud  service  providers  the  consumers  are  dealing  with. 
Using cloud products or services may lead to security concerns for the consumers if they are not 
well aware with the type and particulars of the products or services they are to procure or to use in 
a cloud environment; this is also related to the cloud providers’ identity and reliability. One of the 
inherent problems in this context is that, the consumers might normally not be able to identify or 
foresee all the risks involved in the specific cloud transaction they are dealing with or involved in 
(Svantesson & Clarke, 2010).  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Cloud computing has enormous prospects, but the security threats embedded in cloud computing 
approach  are  directly  proportional  to  its  offered  advantages.  Cloud  computing  is  a  great 
opportunity and lucrative option both to the businesses and the attackers – either parties can have 
their own advantages from cloud computing. The vast possibilities of cloud computing cannot be 
ignored solely for the security issues reason – the ongoing investigation and research for robust, 
consistent  and  integrated  security  models  for  cloud  computing  could  be  the  only  path  of 
motivation.  The  security  issues  could  severely  affect  could  infrastructures.  Security  itself  is 
conceptualized  in  cloud  computing  infrastructure  as  a  distinct  layer  (Dukaric  &  Juric,  2013). 
Security for cloud computing environment is a non-compromising requirement. Cloud computing 
is  inevitable  to  become  the  ideal  (and  possibly  the  ultimate)  approach  to  business  computing 
though  the  security  barriers  along  with  other  issues  need  to  be  resolved  for  cloud  computing  to 

32 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

make it more viable (Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang & Ghalsasi, 2011) . Yet, given its total 
advantages  and  dynamism  and  provided  it  is  deployed  within  an  integrated  and  secured 
infrastructural  framework,  cloud  computing  can  offer  virtual  ownership  and  access  to  'super 
computers' without procuring them physically. Perhaps this is what inspired coining the term SCC 
(Scientific Cloud Computing). Research effort has been contributed to develop faster yet secured 
SCC  tools  (Jorissen,  Villa &  Rehr,  2012)  which  will greatly  influence  the  pace  of  research  and 
motivation  in  various  fields  together  with  clouding  computing  itself.  The  social  implications  of 
cloud computing approaches might emerge with severe impact if robust security models for cloud 
computing do not exist. The security issues for cloud computing are not  related to  the technical 
and  direct  security  breach  only;  a  number  of  social  inconsistency  might  also  be  resulted  even 
without any ‘hard’ security breach having taken place. The distributed and dispersive processing, 
transmission and storage features are behind reason. One such example is the obtaining of digital 
evidences.  The  evolution  of  cloud  computing  might  significantly  affect  the  collection  and 
retention  of  digital  evidence  (Mason  &  George,  2011).  The  vastness  and  potentiality  of  cloud 
computing  cannot  be  overlooked,  subsequently  robust  security  models  for  cloud  computing 
scenarios  is  the  most  prioritized  factor  for  a  successful  cloud  based  infrastructure  development 
and  deployment.  With  the  goal  of  secured  exploitation  of  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture,  the 
security aspects and issues of cloud computing are inherent not only with the elements that from 
the  cloud  infrastructure  but  also  with  all  associated  services  as  well  as  the  ways  computing  is 
done  both  at  the  users’  and  the  cloud  service  providers’  ends.  The  security  issues  in  cloud 
computing  are  somewhat  sensitive  and  crucial  on  the  basis  of  sociological  and  technological 
viewpoints  –  the  technological  inconsistency  that  results  in  security  breach  in  cloud  computing 
might  lead  to  significant  sociological  impacts.  As  a  result,  when  dealing  with  cloud  computing 
and its security issues, technical as well as epistemological factors are equally important to take 
into  consideration.  Based  on  the  fact  that  the  impact  of  cloud  computing  can  include  both  the 
technical  and  social  settings,  the  research  on  cloud  computing  and  its  related  concerns  are  not 
related  only  with  computing  aspects.  Service  oriented  architecture  and  other  characteristics  of 
cloud  computing  suggests  that  the  concept  of  cloud  computing  would  require  to  analyze  the 
practicality  in  line  with  social,  business,  technical  and  legal  perspectives  –  all  these  facets  will 
incorporate  security  issues  either  in  technical  or  strategic  form.  Regardless  of  the  nature  of 
security issues, it can be undoubtedly concluded that the severe adverse effects as a consequence 
of security breaches in cloud computing, the deployment of any form of cloud computing should 
deal with the security concerns corresponding to those of the safety critical systems.

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine 
31 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

to  be  compromised  is  to  be  taken  into  account  (Arshad,  Townsend  &  Xu,  2013).  Some  authors 
have argued that using Internet technologies is not a must for cloud computing (Khorshed et al., 
2012) - but the cost efficiency  and globalization trends  will enforce and motivate almost all the 
businesses to admit Internet and associated technologies to be the ultimate means towards cloud 
computing  approach.  As  a  result,  total  Internet  related  security  concerns  are  anticipated  to  be 
automatically added on top of the cloud-specific security issues. Bringing portability is one of the 
means to make cloud services flexible. The portability of cloud services would also be associated 
with security concerns. Cloud portability enables the cloud users to switch among different cloud 
service  providers  without  being  affected  with  the  necessity  to  change  the  ways  to  accomplish 
tasks in different ways. It is a clear provision on bargaining power for the cloud users; but at the 
same  time,  the  security  issues  with  cloud  portability  are  to  be  counted.  Cloud  portability  might 
bring severe degree of API based security threats (Petcu, Macariu, Panica & Craciun, 2013).  
 
The  wide  transition  to  mobile  computing  practices  in  recent  years  has  made  it  imperative  to 
include mobile computing and its associated technologies as an essential part of cloud computing. 
Resource scarcity as well as other constraints of mobile computing is barriers to cloud computing.  
The  demand  of  huge  data  processing  is  a  problem  for  mobile  end-user  devices  which  has  been 
further  complemented  by  the  security  concerns  of  mobile  cloud  computing.  For  mobile  cloud 
computing,  the  device  level  limitations  has  inspired  researchers  to  suggest  the  inclusion  of 
another level of cloud termed  as ‘mobile cloud’  to aid the processing of the  specific computing 
and  processing  for  mobile  computing  devices  (Fernando,  Loke  &  Rahayu,  2013).  The  earlier 
explained  broadcast  nature  of  satellite  communication  and  related  security  issues  are  equally 
applicable to the mobile cloud computing due to its being wireless communication. Besides, the 
addition of mobile cloud into the perspective would add another cloud with all its security issues 
for a service provider having both mobile cloud and conventional cloud. The addition of mobile 
cloud  in  the  scenario  would  boost  performance,  but  it  would  also  add  another  layer  of  security 
issue not only to the mobile  cloud users,  but  also to the total  infrastructure of  the  cloud service 
provider.  The  hierarchical  arrangement  of  cloud  computing  facilitates  different  level  of 
extensibility  for  the  cloud  users  with  varying  degree  of  associated  security  issues  (Che  et  al., 
2011). Security issues for cloud computing are described by some authors as an obvious one due 
to its nature. In a business model, the risks for the consumers are related to and dependent on the 
relevant  approaches  and  policies  of the  cloud  service  providers  the  consumers  are  dealing  with. 
Using cloud products or services may lead to security concerns for the consumers if they are not 
well aware with the type and particulars of the products or services they are to procure or to use in 
a cloud environment; this is also related to the cloud providers’ identity and reliability. One of the 
inherent problems in this context is that, the consumers might normally not be able to identify or 
foresee all the risks involved in the specific cloud transaction they are dealing with or involved in 
(Svantesson & Clarke, 2010).  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Cloud computing has enormous prospects, but the security threats embedded in cloud computing 
approach  are  directly  proportional  to  its  offered  advantages.  Cloud  computing  is  a  great 
opportunity and lucrative option both to the businesses and the attackers – either parties can have 
their own advantages from cloud computing. The vast possibilities of cloud computing cannot be 
ignored solely for the security issues reason – the ongoing investigation and research for robust, 
consistent  and  integrated  security  models  for  cloud  computing  could  be  the  only  path  of 
motivation.  The  security  issues  could  severely  affect  could  infrastructures.  Security  itself  is 
conceptualized  in  cloud  computing  infrastructure  as  a  distinct  layer  (Dukaric  &  Juric,  2013). 
Security for cloud computing environment is a non-compromising requirement. Cloud computing 
is  inevitable  to  become  the  ideal  (and  possibly  the  ultimate)  approach  to  business  computing 
though  the  security  barriers  along  with  other  issues  need  to  be  resolved  for  cloud  computing  to 

32 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

make it more viable (Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang & Ghalsasi, 2011) . Yet, given its total 
advantages  and  dynamism  and  provided  it  is  deployed  within  an  integrated  and  secured 
infrastructural  framework,  cloud  computing  can  offer  virtual  ownership  and  access  to  'super 
computers' without procuring them physically. Perhaps this is what inspired coining the term SCC 
(Scientific Cloud Computing). Research effort has been contributed to develop faster yet secured 
SCC  tools  (Jorissen,  Villa &  Rehr,  2012)  which  will greatly  influence  the  pace  of  research  and 
motivation  in  various  fields  together  with  clouding  computing  itself.  The  social  implications  of 
cloud computing approaches might emerge with severe impact if robust security models for cloud 
computing do not exist. The security issues for cloud computing are not  related to  the technical 
and  direct  security  breach  only;  a  number  of  social  inconsistency  might  also  be  resulted  even 
without any ‘hard’ security breach having taken place. The distributed and dispersive processing, 
transmission and storage features are behind reason. One such example is the obtaining of digital 
evidences.  The  evolution  of  cloud  computing  might  significantly  affect  the  collection  and 
retention  of  digital  evidence  (Mason  &  George,  2011).  The  vastness  and  potentiality  of  cloud 
computing  cannot  be  overlooked,  subsequently  robust  security  models  for  cloud  computing 
scenarios  is  the  most  prioritized  factor  for  a  successful  cloud  based  infrastructure  development 
and  deployment.  With  the  goal  of  secured  exploitation  of  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture,  the 
security aspects and issues of cloud computing are inherent not only with the elements that from 
the  cloud  infrastructure  but  also  with  all  associated  services  as  well  as  the  ways  computing  is 
done  both  at  the  users’  and  the  cloud  service  providers’  ends.  The  security  issues  in  cloud 
computing  are  somewhat  sensitive  and  crucial  on  the  basis  of  sociological  and  technological 
viewpoints  –  the  technological  inconsistency  that  results  in  security  breach  in  cloud  computing 
might  lead  to  significant  sociological  impacts.  As  a  result,  when  dealing  with  cloud  computing 
and its security issues, technical as well as epistemological factors are equally important to take 
into  consideration.  Based  on  the  fact  that  the  impact  of  cloud  computing  can  include  both  the 
technical  and  social  settings,  the  research  on  cloud  computing  and  its  related  concerns  are  not 
related  only  with  computing  aspects.  Service  oriented  architecture  and  other  characteristics  of 
cloud  computing  suggests  that  the  concept  of  cloud  computing  would  require  to  analyze  the 
practicality  in  line  with  social,  business,  technical  and  legal  perspectives  –  all  these  facets  will 
incorporate  security  issues  either  in  technical  or  strategic  form.  Regardless  of  the  nature  of 
security issues, it can be undoubtedly concluded that the severe adverse effects as a consequence 
of security breaches in cloud computing, the deployment of any form of cloud computing should 
deal with the security concerns corresponding to those of the safety critical systems.

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine 
31 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

to  be  compromised  is  to  be  taken  into  account  (Arshad,  Townsend  &  Xu,  2013).  Some  authors 
have argued that using Internet technologies is not a must for cloud computing (Khorshed et al., 
2012) - but the cost efficiency  and globalization trends  will enforce and motivate almost all the 
businesses to admit Internet and associated technologies to be the ultimate means towards cloud 
computing  approach.  As  a  result,  total  Internet  related  security  concerns  are  anticipated  to  be 
automatically added on top of the cloud-specific security issues. Bringing portability is one of the 
means to make cloud services flexible. The portability of cloud services would also be associated 
with security concerns. Cloud portability enables the cloud users to switch among different cloud 
service  providers  without  being  affected  with  the  necessity  to  change  the  ways  to  accomplish 
tasks in different ways. It is a clear provision on bargaining power for the cloud users; but at the 
same  time,  the  security  issues  with  cloud  portability  are  to  be  counted.  Cloud  portability  might 
bring severe degree of API based security threats (Petcu, Macariu, Panica & Craciun, 2013).  
 
The  wide  transition  to  mobile  computing  practices  in  recent  years  has  made  it  imperative  to 
include mobile computing and its associated technologies as an essential part of cloud computing. 
Resource scarcity as well as other constraints of mobile computing is barriers to cloud computing.  
The  demand  of  huge  data  processing  is  a  problem  for  mobile  end-user  devices  which  has  been 
further  complemented  by  the  security  concerns  of  mobile  cloud  computing.  For  mobile  cloud 
computing,  the  device  level  limitations  has  inspired  researchers  to  suggest  the  inclusion  of 
another level of cloud termed  as ‘mobile cloud’  to aid the processing of the  specific computing 
and  processing  for  mobile  computing  devices  (Fernando,  Loke  &  Rahayu,  2013).  The  earlier 
explained  broadcast  nature  of  satellite  communication  and  related  security  issues  are  equally 
applicable to the mobile cloud computing due to its being wireless communication. Besides, the 
addition of mobile cloud into the perspective would add another cloud with all its security issues 
for a service provider having both mobile cloud and conventional cloud. The addition of mobile 
cloud  in  the  scenario  would  boost  performance,  but  it  would  also  add  another  layer  of  security 
issue not only to the mobile  cloud users,  but  also to the total  infrastructure of  the  cloud service 
provider.  The  hierarchical  arrangement  of  cloud  computing  facilitates  different  level  of 
extensibility  for  the  cloud  users  with  varying  degree  of  associated  security  issues  (Che  et  al., 
2011). Security issues for cloud computing are described by some authors as an obvious one due 
to its nature. In a business model, the risks for the consumers are related to and dependent on the 
relevant  approaches  and  policies  of the  cloud  service  providers  the  consumers  are  dealing  with. 
Using cloud products or services may lead to security concerns for the consumers if they are not 
well aware with the type and particulars of the products or services they are to procure or to use in 
a cloud environment; this is also related to the cloud providers’ identity and reliability. One of the 
inherent problems in this context is that, the consumers might normally not be able to identify or 
foresee all the risks involved in the specific cloud transaction they are dealing with or involved in 
(Svantesson & Clarke, 2010).  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Cloud computing has enormous prospects, but the security threats embedded in cloud computing 
approach  are  directly  proportional  to  its  offered  advantages.  Cloud  computing  is  a  great 
opportunity and lucrative option both to the businesses and the attackers – either parties can have 
their own advantages from cloud computing. The vast possibilities of cloud computing cannot be 
ignored solely for the security issues reason – the ongoing investigation and research for robust, 
consistent  and  integrated  security  models  for  cloud  computing  could  be  the  only  path  of 
motivation.  The  security  issues  could  severely  affect  could  infrastructures.  Security  itself  is 
conceptualized  in  cloud  computing  infrastructure  as  a  distinct  layer  (Dukaric  &  Juric,  2013). 
Security for cloud computing environment is a non-compromising requirement. Cloud computing 
is  inevitable  to  become  the  ideal  (and  possibly  the  ultimate)  approach  to  business  computing 
though  the  security  barriers  along  with  other  issues  need  to  be  resolved  for  cloud  computing  to 

32 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

make it more viable (Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang & Ghalsasi, 2011) . Yet, given its total 
advantages  and  dynamism  and  provided  it  is  deployed  within  an  integrated  and  secured 
infrastructural  framework,  cloud  computing  can  offer  virtual  ownership  and  access  to  'super 
computers' without procuring them physically. Perhaps this is what inspired coining the term SCC 
(Scientific Cloud Computing). Research effort has been contributed to develop faster yet secured 
SCC  tools  (Jorissen,  Villa &  Rehr,  2012)  which  will greatly  influence  the  pace  of  research  and 
motivation  in  various  fields  together  with  clouding  computing  itself.  The  social  implications  of 
cloud computing approaches might emerge with severe impact if robust security models for cloud 
computing do not exist. The security issues for cloud computing are not  related to  the technical 
and  direct  security  breach  only;  a  number  of  social  inconsistency  might  also  be  resulted  even 
without any ‘hard’ security breach having taken place. The distributed and dispersive processing, 
transmission and storage features are behind reason. One such example is the obtaining of digital 
evidences.  The  evolution  of  cloud  computing  might  significantly  affect  the  collection  and 
retention  of  digital  evidence  (Mason  &  George,  2011).  The  vastness  and  potentiality  of  cloud 
computing  cannot  be  overlooked,  subsequently  robust  security  models  for  cloud  computing 
scenarios  is  the  most  prioritized  factor  for  a  successful  cloud  based  infrastructure  development 
and  deployment.  With  the  goal  of  secured  exploitation  of  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture,  the 
security aspects and issues of cloud computing are inherent not only with the elements that from 
the  cloud  infrastructure  but  also  with  all  associated  services  as  well  as  the  ways  computing  is 
done  both  at  the  users’  and  the  cloud  service  providers’  ends.  The  security  issues  in  cloud 
computing  are  somewhat  sensitive  and  crucial  on  the  basis  of  sociological  and  technological 
viewpoints  –  the  technological  inconsistency  that  results  in  security  breach  in  cloud  computing 
might  lead  to  significant  sociological  impacts.  As  a  result,  when  dealing  with  cloud  computing 
and its security issues, technical as well as epistemological factors are equally important to take 
into  consideration.  Based  on  the  fact  that  the  impact  of  cloud  computing  can  include  both  the 
technical  and  social  settings,  the  research  on  cloud  computing  and  its  related  concerns  are  not 
related  only  with  computing  aspects.  Service  oriented  architecture  and  other  characteristics  of 
cloud  computing  suggests  that  the  concept  of  cloud  computing  would  require  to  analyze  the 
practicality  in  line  with  social,  business,  technical  and  legal  perspectives  –  all  these  facets  will 
incorporate  security  issues  either  in  technical  or  strategic  form.  Regardless  of  the  nature  of 
security issues, it can be undoubtedly concluded that the severe adverse effects as a consequence 
of security breaches in cloud computing, the deployment of any form of cloud computing should 
deal with the security concerns corresponding to those of the safety critical systems.

ABSTRACT 
 
Cloud  computing  has  formed  the  conceptual  and  infrastructural  basis  for  tomorrow’s  computing.  The 
global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. While it is important 
to take advantages of could  based  computing by means  of  deploying it in  diversified  sectors, the  security 
aspects in a cloud based computing environment remains at the core of interest. Cloud based services and 
service providers are being evolved which has resulted in a new business trend based on cloud technology. 
With  the  introduction  of  numerous  cloud  based  services  and  geographically  dispersed  cloud  service 
providers,  sensitive  information  of  different  entities  are  normally  stored  in  remote  servers  and  locations 
with  the  possibilities  of  being  exposed  to  unwanted  parties  in  situations  where  the  cloud  servers  storing 
those information are compromised. If security is not robust and consistent, the flexibility and advantages 
that  cloud  computing  has  to  offer  will  have  little  credibility.  This  paper  presents  a  review  on  the  cloud 
computing  concepts  as  well  as  security  issues  inherent  within  the  context  of  cloud  computing  and  cloud 
infrastructure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent  developments  in  the  field  of  could  computing  have  immensely  changed  the  way  of 
computing  as  well  as  the  concept  of  computing  resources.  In  a  cloud  based  computing 
infrastructure,  the  resources  are  normally  in  someone  else's  premise  or  network  and  accessed 
remotely  by  the  cloud  users  (Petre,  2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal,  2012). 
Processing is done remotely implying the fact that the data and other elements from a person need 
to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud  infrastructure  or  server  for  processing;  and  the  output  is  returned 
upon  completion of required  processing.  In some  cases, it might  be  required or at least possible 
for a person to store data on remote cloud servers. These gives the following three sensitive states 
or scenarios that are of particular concern within the operational context of cloud computing: 
 

•  The transmission of personal sensitive data to the cloud server,  
•  The transmission of data from the cloud server to clients' computers and  
•  The storage of clients’ personal data in cloud servers which are remote server not 

owned by the clients.  

 
All the above three states of cloud computing are severely prone to security breach that makes the 
research and investigation within the security aspects of cloud computing practice an imperative 
one. There have been a number of different blends that are being used in cloud computing realm, 
but the core concept remain same – the infrastructure, or roughly speaking, the resources remain

somewhere  else  with  someone  else's  ownership  and  the  users  'rent'  it  for  the  time  they  use  the 
infrastructure  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011;  Rashmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja, 
2012).  In  some  cases,  stored  sensitive  data  at  remote  cloud  servers  are  also  to  be  counted. 
Security has been at the core of safe computing practices.  When it is possible for any unwanted 
party to 'sneak' on any private computers by means of different ways of 'hacking'; the provision of 
widening  the  scope  to  access  someone's  personal  data  by  means  of  cloud  computing  eventually 
raises further security concerns. Cloud computing cannot eliminate this widened scope due to its 
nature  and  approach.  As  a  result,  security  has  always  been  an  issue  with  cloud  computing 
practices. Robustness of security and a secured computing infrastructure is not a one-off effort, it 
is rather ongoing – this makes it essential to analyse  and realize the state-of-the-art of the cloud 
computing  security  as  a  mandatory  practice.  Cloud  is  mainly  categorized  as  private  cloud, 
community  cloud,  public  cloud  and  hybrid  cloud  (Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  jangwal, 
2012; Rashmi et al., 2013; Qaisar & Khawaja, 2012; Kuyoro, Ibikunle & Awodele, 2011; Suresh 
& Prasad, 2012; Youssef, 2012) - the discussion in this paper assumes only one category of cloud 
exists  which  is  public  cloud;  as  this  assumption  will  well  satisfy  all  the  characteristics  of  any 
other type of cloud. Due to its diversified potentiality, the approach to cloud computing is being 
thought  to  be  as  the  5th  utility  to  join  the  league  of  existing  utilities  water,  electricity,  gas  and 
telephony  (Buyya,  Yeo,  Venugopal,  Broberg  &  Brandic,  2009)  rather  than  being  just  another 
service.  
 
The study presented in this paper is organized with a view to discuss and indentify the approach 
to cloud computing as well as the security issues and concerns that must be taken into account in 
the deployment towards a cloud based computing infrastructure. Discussion on the technological 
concepts  and  approaches  to  cloud  computing  including  the  architectural  illustration  has  been 
taken into consideration within the context of discussion in this paper. Security issues inherent in 
cloud computing approach have been discussed afterwards. The exploration in the technological 
and  security  concerns  of  cloud  computing  has  led  to  the  concluding  realization  on  the  overall 
aspects  of  cloud  computing.  The  approaches  to  counter  security  issues  inherent  in  cloud 
computing  are  numerous  with  diversified  facets  and  applications  which  has  been  kept  out  of 
scope. A discussion on the authentication of cloud computing has been addressed as it forms the 
holistic basis to embed integrity in the context of cloud computing security. 
 
2. CLOUD COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The  term  cloud  computing  is  rather  a  concept  which  is  a  generalized  meaning  evolved  from 
distributed and grid computing. Cloud computing is described as the offspring of distributed and 
grid computing by some authors (Che, Duan, Zhang & Fan, 2011).The straightforward meaning 
of cloud computing refers to the features and scenarios where total computing could be done by 
using  someone  else’s  network  where  ownership  of  hardware  and  soft  resources  are  of  external 
parties.  In  general  practice,  the  dispersive  nature  of  the  resources  that  are  considered  to  be  the 
‘cloud’  to  the  users  are  essentially  in  the  form  of  distributed  computing;  though  this  is  not 
apparent  or  by  its  definition  of  cloud  computing,  do  not  essentially  have  to  be  apparent  to  the 
users.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  cloud  has  evolved  in  two  broad  perspectives  –  to  rent  the  infrastructure  in 
cloud, or to rent any specific service in the cloud. Where the former one deals with the hardware 
and software usage on the cloud, the later one is confined only with the 'soft' products or services 
from  the  cloud  service  and  infrastructure  providers.  The  computing  world  has  been  introduced 
with a number of terminologies like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) 
and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) with the evolution of cloud computing. As discussed earlier, 
the term ‘cloud computing’ is rather a concept, so are the terminologies to define different blends 
of cloud computing. At its core essence, cloud computing is nothing but a specialized form of grid 

26 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

and  distributed  computing  which  varies  in  terms  of  infrastructure,  services,  deployment  and 
geographic  dispersion  (Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Westphall  et  al.,  2011;  Hamlen,  Kantarcioglu, 
Khan, & Thuraisingham, 2010). In a pervasive meaning within the context of computer networks, 
infrastructure could be thought of as the hardware as well as their alignment where platform is the 
operating system which acts as the platform for the software (Singh & jangwal, 2012; Lee, 2012). 
Thus the concept of cloud based services is hierarchically built from bottom to top in the order of 
IaaS,  PaaS and SaaS.  This is merely the level of  abstraction  that defines the extent to which an 
end-user could 'borrow' the resources ranging from infrastructure to software – the core concern 
of security and the fashion of computing are not affected by this level of abstraction. As a result, 
security  is  to  be  considered  within  any  form  of  cloud  computing  (Bisong  &  Rahman,  2011) 
regardless of flavour, hierarchy and level of abstraction. Virtualization is an inevitable technology 
that is highly coupled with the concept of cloud computing (Buyya et al.,  2009; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 
2012;  Hashizume  et  al.  2013;  Kim,  2009;  Mosher,  2011;  Atayero  &  Feyisetan,  2011;  Zissis  & 
Lekkas,  2012)  –  it  is  the  virtualization  technology  that  complements  cloud  services  specially  in 
the  form  of  PaaS  and  SaaS  where  one  physical  infrastructure  contains  services  or  platforms  to 
deliver a number of cloud users simultaneously. This leads to the addition of total security aspects 
of  virtualization  technology  on  top  of  the  existing  security  concerns  and  issues  of  cloud 
computing.  
 
Figure 1 illustrates a typical cloud based scenario that includes the cloud service provider and the 
cloud users in a cloud computing architecture. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: A Typical Cloud Architecture 

The  illustration  of  cloud  architecture  in  figure  1  is  a  simplest  one  where  few  complex 
characteristics of cloud computing (e.g. redundancy, server replication, and geographic dispersion 
of the cloud providers’ network) are not shown – the purpose of the illustration is to establish the 
arrangement that makes the concept of cloud computing a tangible one. The network architecture 

27 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

is  self  explanatory  with  the  identification  of  cloud  users  when  considered  in-line  with  the 
discussion  of  the  cloud  computing  concept  presented  earlier.  One  notable  part  from  the 
architecture is that, while the cloud users are clearly identified and named accordingly due to their 
remote  location  and  means  of  remote  access  to  the  cloud  servers,  the  admin  users  who  are 
administering the cloud servers are not cloud users in any form with respect to the cloud service 
provider’s  network  in  the  scenario.  It  is  arguable  whether  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  are  cloud 
users  or  not.  Such  room  for  argument  could  exist  due  to  the  phrase  ‘cloud  computing’  being  a 
concept rather than a technical terminology. If the definition of cloud computing is taken to have 
essential  arrangements  of  being  the  servers  located  remotely  that  are  accessed  through  public 
infrastructure  (or  through  cloud),  then  the  LAN  users  in  figure  1  may  not  be  considered  as  the 
cloud  users  in  the  context.  With  respect  to  distributed  and  grid  computing  as  the  mother 
technology that define the infrastructural approach to achieve cloud computing, the LAN users in 
the  scenario  are  essentially  the  cloud  users  when  they  use  the  cloud  services  offered  by  the 
servers; the LAN users in this perspective are essentially using resources that are ‘borrowed’ from 
the servers on an on-demand basis.  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical arrangement based on which a cloud is perceived in the form 
of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS from any cloud end-user’s viewpoint. 
 

Figure 2: Cloud Service Hierarchy 

 

 

As depicted in figure 2, the technical details, arrangements and management of the cloud service 
providers’  network  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  user.  From  the  end  of  the  cloud  user,  the  service 
from the provider comes in the form of SaaS, PaaS or IaaS where the cloud user has no intention 
or worry about what goes on in the internal arrangement of the cloud service providers’ network. 
Any disruption of any form for whatever is the reason, deem to the cloud users either as service 
unavailability or quality deterioration – its affect and ways to counter this disruption is a critical 
part for the cloud infrastructure. Security issues might play a stimulating role as a driving factor 
for any aforementioned disruption.

3. AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD 
 
Security  is  the  most  prioritized  aspect  for  any  form  of  computing,  making  it  an  obvious 
expectation that security issues are crucial for cloud environment as well. As the cloud computing 
approach could be associated with having users’ sensitive data stored both at clients’ end as well 
as in cloud servers, identity management and authentication are very crucial in cloud computing 
(Kim & Hong, 2012; Emam, 2013; Han, Susilo & Mu, 2013; Yassin, Jin, Ibrahim, Qiang & Zou, 
2012). Verification of eligible users’ credentials and protecting such credentials are part of main 
security  issues  in  the  cloud  -  violation  in  these  areas  could  lead  to  undetected  security  breach 
(Kumar, 2012) at least to some extent for  some period. A possible authentication scenario for  a 
cloud infrastructure is illustrated in figure 3. 
 

Figure 3: Authentication in the Cloud 

 

 

 

The  illustration  presented  in  figure  3  conveys  that  the  authentication  for  the  cloud  users  can  be 
done  either  by  the  cloud  service  provider  or  the  service  provider  can  outsource  the  identity 
management  and  authentication  service  to  third  party  specialists  (Gonzalez,  Miers,  Redigolo, 
Simplicio, Carvalho, Naslund & Pourzandi, 2012; Sharma & Mittal, 2013). In the later case, the 
cloud  service  provider  is  required  to  have  collaboration  with  the  third  party  authentication 
specialist – the collaboration between the cloud service provider and the third party authentication 
specialist during the authentication process of cloud users is done essentially through cloud. This 
feature  adds  performance  overheads  and  security  issues  to  the  cloud  context  as  the  message 
passing between third party authentication management authority and the cloud service provider 
as  part  of  collaboration  might  essentially  be  done  through  cloud  infrastructure.  As  discussed 
earlier,  the  total  authentication  process  and  how  they  are  carried  out  -  regardless  of  the 
involvement  of  third  party  authentication  specialists  –  is  transparent  to  the  cloud  users.  The 
29 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

illustration  on  the  authentication  scenario  presented  above  is  a  fairly  simple  one  –  if 
geographically  dispersed  servers  are  deployed  by  the  cloud  service  providers  then  the  total 
authentication  process  might  be  far  more  complex  in  terms  of  security,  underlying  algorithm  as 
well  as  performance  level.  Whatever  is  the  level  of  complexity,  the  introduction  of  third  party 
authentication  and  identity  management  specialist  into  any  cloud  architecture  should  have  only 
one goal; and the goal is to strengthen the robustness of security in the concerned area which the 
cloud service provider itself is not capable of to deploy or offer. 
 
4. SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD 
 
Cloud  computing  comes  with  numerous  possibilities  and  challenges  simultaneously.  Of  the 
challenges, security is considered to be a critical barrier for cloud computing in its path to success 
(Khorshed,  Ali  &  Wasimi,  2012).  The  security  challenges  for  cloud  computing  approach  are 
somewhat  dynamic  and  vast.  Data  location  is  a  crucial  factor  in  cloud  computing  security 
(Teneyuca,  2011).  Location  transparency  is  one  of  the  prominent  flexibilities  for  cloud 
computing, which is a security threat at the same time – without knowing the specific location of 
data storage, the provision of data protection act for some region might be severely affected and 
violated.  Cloud  users’  personal  data  security  is  thus  a  crucial  concern  in  a  cloud  computing 
environment  (Joint,  Baker  &  Eccles,  2009;  Ismail,  2011;  King  &  Raja,  2012).  In  terms  of 
customers’ personal or business data security, the strategic policies of the cloud providers are of 
highest  significance  (Joint  &  Baker,  2011)  as  the  technical  security  solely  is  not  adequate  to 
address the problem. Trust is another problem which raises security concerns to use cloud service 
(Ryan & Falvy, 2012) for the reason that it is directly related to the credibility and authenticity of 
the  cloud  service  providers.  Trust  establishment  might  become  the  key  to  establish  a  successful 
cloud  computing  environment.  The  provision  of  trust  model  is  essential  in  cloud  computing  as 
this is a common interest area for all stakeholders for any given cloud computing scenario. Trust 
in  cloud  might  be  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  among  which  some  are  automation 
management,  human  factors,  processes  and  policies  (Abbadi  &  Martin,  2011). Trust  in  cloud is 
not  a  technical  security  issue,  but  it  is  the  most  influential  soft  factor  that  is  driven  by  security 
issues inherent in cloud computing to a great extent. All kinds of attacks that are applicable to a 
computer network and the data in transit equally applies to cloud based services – some threats in 
this  category  are  man-in-the-middle  attack,  phishing,  eavesdropping,  sniffing  and  other  similar 
attacks.  DDoS  (Distributed  Denial  of  Service)  attack  is  one  common  yet  major  attack  for  cloud 
computing  infrastructure  (Dou,  Chen  &  Chen,  2013).  The  well  known  DDoS  attack  can  be  a 
potential  problem  for  cloud  computing,  though  not  with  any  exception  of  having  no  option  to 
mitigate this. The  security of virtual machine  will define the integrity and  level  of security of a 
cloud  environment  to  greater  extent  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  &  Mehfuz,  2013;  Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). Accounting & authentication as well as using encryption  falls within the practice  of safe 
computing - they can be well considered as part of security concerns for cloud computing (Lee, 
2012;  Ogigau-Neamtiu,  2012;  Singh  &  Jangwal,  2012).  However,  it  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  risk  and  security  concerns  in  this  regard.  For  example,  vendor  lock-in  might  be 
considered as one of the possible risks in cloud based services which do not essentially have to be 
related  to  security  aspects.  On  the  contrary,  using  specific  type  of  operating  system  (e.g.  open-
source vs. proprietary) might pose security threat and concerns which, of course, is a security risk. 
Other  examples  of  business  risks  of  cloud  computing  could  be  licensing  issues,  service 
unavailability, provider's business discontinuity that do not fall within the security concerns from 
a technical viewpoint. Thus, in cloud computing context, a security concern is always some type 
of  risk  but  any  risk  cannot  be  blindly  judged  to  be  a  security  concern.    Allocation  of 
responsibilities  among  the  parties  involved  in  a  cloud  computing  infrastructure  might  result  in 
experiencing 
to  a  situation  with  security 
vulnerabilities. Like any other network scenario, the provision of insider-attack remains as a valid 
threat for cloud computing (Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012). Any security tools or other kinds of software 

inconsistency  which  might  eventually 

lead 

30 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

used  in  a  cloud  environment  might  have  security  loopholes  which  in  turn  would  pose  security 
risks to the cloud infrastructure itself. The problem with third party APIs as well as spammers are 
threats to the cloud environment (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Singh & Jangwal, 2012).  
 
As  cloud  computing  normally  means  using  public  networks  and  subsequently  putting  the 
transmitting  data  exposed  to  the  world,  cyber  attacks  in  any  form  are  anticipated  for  cloud 
computing.  The  existing  contemporary  cloud  based  services  have  been  found  to  suffer  from 
vulnerability issues with the existence of possible security loopholes that could be exploited by an 
attacker.  Security  and  privacy  both  are  concerns  in  cloud  computing  due  to  the  nature  of  such 
computing approach (Bisong & Rahman, 2011).  The approach by which cloud computing is done 
has  made  it  prone  to  both  information  security  and  network  security  issues  (Rakhmi,  Sahoo  & 
Mehfuz,  2013;  Qaisar  &  Khawaja,  2012).  Third  party  relationship  might  emerge  as  a  risk  for 
cloud environment along with other security threats inherent in infrastructural and virtual machine 
aspects  (Hashizume  et  al.,  2013).  Factors  like  software  bugs,  social  engineering,  human  errors 
make the security for cloud a dynamically challenging one (Kim, 2009). Intrusion detection is the 
most important role in seamless network monitoring to reduce security risks. If the contemporary 
IDSs (Intrusion detection Systems) are inefficient, the resultant consequence might be undetected 
security breach for cloud environment (Westphall et al., 2011).  
 
The  facets  from  which  the  security  threat  might  be  introduced  into  a  cloud  environment  are 
numerous  ranging  from  database,  virtual  servers,  and  network  to  operating  systems,  load 
balancing, memory management and concurrency control (Hamlen et al., 2010). Data segregation 
and session hijacking are two potential and unavoidable security threats  for cloud users. One of 
the challenges for cloud computing is in its level of abstraction as well as dynamism in scalability 
which  results  in  poorly  defined  security  or  infrastructural  boundary.  Privacy  and  its  underlying 
concept  might significantly vary in different regions  and thus it may lead to  security breach for 
cloud  services  in  specific  contexts  and  scenarios  (Chen  &  Zhao,  2012).  Data  loss  and  various 
botnets can come into action to breach security of cloud servers. Besides, multi-tenancy model is 
also an aspect that needs to be given attention (Kuyoro et al., 2011; Ogigau-Neamtiu, 2012) when 
it comes to security. Security in the data-centres of cloud providers are also within the interests of 
security  issues,  as  a  single  physical  server  would  hold  many  clients'  data  (Okuhara,  Shiozaki  & 
Suzuki,  2010)  making  it  a  common  shared  platform  in  terms  of  physical  server  or  operating 
system.  The  storage  security  at  the  cloud  service  providers  data  centres  are  also  directly  linked 
with the security of  the cloud services (Mircea,  2012). All  the traditional security risks are thus 
applicable  with  added  degree  of  potency  in  a  cloud  infrastructure  which  makes  the  ongoing 
success of cloud computing a quite challenging one. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are 
the generalized categories into which the security concerns of a cloud environment falls. Threats 
for  a  cloud  infrastructure  are  applicable  both  to  data  and  infrastructure  (Agarwal  &  Agarwal, 
2011). 
 
Different modes of data transfer and communication means (e.g. satellite communication) might 
need  to  take  into  account.  Huge  amount  of  data  transfer  is  a  common  anticipation  in  a  cloud 
environment, the communication technology used along with the security concerns of the adapted 
communication  technology  also  becomes  a  security  concern  for  the  cloud  computing  approach. 
The broadcast nature of some communication technology is a core concern in this regard (Celesti, 
Fazio, Villari & Puliafito, 2012). Cloud environment is associated with both physical and virtual 
resources and they pose different level of security issues – having no sophisticated authentication 
mechanism to fully address the security threats is an existing problem for cloud computing. It has 
mainly  resulted  in  the  situations  where  grid  computing  has  been  taken  as  an  embedded  part  of 
cloud computing (Casola, Cuomo, Rak & Villano, 2013). As the virtualized resources are highly 
coupled  with  a  cloud infrastructure,  intrusion related  security  concerns  are  of  utmost  priority  as 
part  of  security  issues.  Arbitrary  intermittent intrusion  needs  to  be  monitored  in  the  operational 
context of a cloud computing infrastructure where the severity of possibility for a virtual machine 
31 

International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications (IJNSA), Vol.6, No.1, January 2014 

to  be  compromised  is  to  be  taken  into  account  (Arshad,  Townsend  &  Xu,  2013).  Some  authors 
have argued that using Internet technologies is not a must for cloud computing (Khorshed et al., 
2012) - but the cost efficiency  and globalization trends  will enforce and motivate almost all the 
businesses to admit Internet and associated technologies to be the ultimate means towards cloud 
computing  approach.  As  a  result,  total  Internet  related  security  concerns  are  anticipated  to  be 
automatically added on top of the cloud-specific security issues. Bringing portability is one of the 
means to make cloud services flexible. The portability of cloud services would also be associated 
with security concerns. Cloud portability enables the cloud users to switch among different cloud 
service  providers  without  being  affected  with  the  necessity  to  change  the  ways  to  accomplish 
tasks in different ways. It is a clear provision on bargaining power for the cloud users; but at the 
same  time,  the  security  issues  with  cloud  portability  are  to  be  counted.  Cloud  portability  might 
bring severe degree of API based security threats (Petcu, Macariu, Panica & Craciun, 2013).  
 
The  wide  transition  to  mobile  computing  practices  in  recent  years  has  made  it  imperative  to 
include mobile computing and its associated technologies as an essential part of cloud computing. 
Resource scarcity as well as other constraints of mobile computing is barriers to cloud computing.  
The  demand  of  huge  data  processing  is  a  problem  for  mobile  end-user  devices  which  has  been 
further  complemented  by  the  security  concerns  of  mobile  cloud  computing.  For  mobile  cloud 
computing,  the  device  level  limitations  has  inspired  researchers  to  suggest  the  inclusion  of 
another level of cloud termed  as ‘mobile cloud’  to aid the processing of the  specific computing 
and  processing  for  mobile  computing  devices  (Fernando,  Loke  &  Rahayu,  2013).  The  earlier 
explained  broadcast  nature  of  satellite  communication  and  related  security  issues  are  equally 
applicable to the mobile cloud computing due to its being wireless communication. Besides, the 
addition of mobile cloud into the perspective would add another cloud with all its security issues 
for a service provider having both mobile cloud and conventional cloud. The addition of mobile 
cloud  in  the  scenario  would  boost  performance,  but  it  would  also  add  another  layer  of  security 
issue not only to the mobile  cloud users,  but  also to the total  infrastructure of  the  cloud service 
provider.  The  hierarchical  arrangement  of  cloud  computing  facilitates  different  level  of 
extensibility  for  the  cloud  users  with  varying  degree  of  associated  security  issues  (Che  et  al., 
2011). Security issues for cloud computing are described by some authors as an obvious one due 
to its nature. In a business model, the risks for the consumers are related to and dependent on the 
relevant  approaches  and  policies  of the  cloud  service  providers  the  consumers  are  dealing  with. 
Using cloud products or services may lead to security concerns for the consumers if they are not 
well aware with the type and particulars of the products or services they are to procure or to use in 
a cloud environment; this is also related to the cloud providers’ identity and reliability. One of the 
inherent problems in this context is that, the consumers might normally not be able to identify or 
foresee all the risks involved in the specific cloud transaction they are dealing with or involved in 
(Svantesson & Clarke, 2010).  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Cloud computing has enormous prospects, but the security threats embedded in cloud computing 
approach  are  directly  proportional  to  its  offered  advantages.  Cloud  computing  is  a  great 
opportunity and lucrative option both to the businesses and the attackers – either parties can have 
their own advantages from cloud computing. The vast possibilities of cloud computing cannot be 
ignored solely for the security issues reason – the ongoing investigation and research for robust, 
consistent  and  integrated  security  models  for  cloud  computing  could  be  the  only  path  of 
motivation.  The  security  issues  could  severely  affect  could  infrastructures.  Security  itself  is 
conceptualized  in  cloud  computing  infrastructure  as  a  distinct  layer  (Dukaric  &  Juric,  2013). 
Security for cloud computing environment is a non-compromising requirement. Cloud computing 
is  inevitable  to  become  the  ideal  (and  possibly  the  ultimate)  approach  to  business  computing 
though  the  security  barriers  along  with  other  issues  need  to  be  resolved  for  cloud  computing  to

make it more viable (Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang & Ghalsasi, 2011) . Yet, given its total 
advantages  and  dynamism  and  provided  it  is  deployed  within  an  integrated  and  secured 
infrastructural  framework,  cloud  computing  can  offer  virtual  ownership  and  access  to  'super 
computers' without procuring them physically. Perhaps this is what inspired coining the term SCC 
(Scientific Cloud Computing). Research effort has been contributed to develop faster yet secured 
SCC  tools  (Jorissen,  Villa &  Rehr,  2012)  which  will greatly  influence  the  pace  of  research  and 
motivation  in  various  fields  together  with  clouding  computing  itself.  The  social  implications  of 
cloud computing approaches might emerge with severe impact if robust security models for cloud 
computing do not exist. The security issues for cloud computing are not  related to  the technical 
and  direct  security  breach  only;  a  number  of  social  inconsistency  might  also  be  resulted  even 
without any ‘hard’ security breach having taken place. The distributed and dispersive processing, 
transmission and storage features are behind reason. One such example is the obtaining of digital 
evidences.  The  evolution  of  cloud  computing  might  significantly  affect  the  collection  and 
retention  of  digital  evidence  (Mason  &  George,  2011).  The  vastness  and  potentiality  of  cloud 
computing  cannot  be  overlooked,  subsequently  robust  security  models  for  cloud  computing 
scenarios  is  the  most  prioritized  factor  for  a  successful  cloud  based  infrastructure  development 
and  deployment.  With  the  goal  of  secured  exploitation  of  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture,  the 
security aspects and issues of cloud computing are inherent not only with the elements that from 
the  cloud  infrastructure  but  also  with  all  associated  services  as  well  as  the  ways  computing  is 
done  both  at  the  users’  and  the  cloud  service  providers’  ends.  The  security  issues  in  cloud 
computing  are  somewhat  sensitive  and  crucial  on  the  basis  of  sociological  and  technological 
viewpoints  –  the  technological  inconsistency  that  results  in  security  breach  in  cloud  computing 
might  lead  to  significant  sociological  impacts.  As  a  result,  when  dealing  with  cloud  computing 
and its security issues, technical as well as epistemological factors are equally important to take 
into  consideration.  Based  on  the  fact  that  the  impact  of  cloud  computing  can  include  both  the 
technical  and  social  settings,  the  research  on  cloud  computing  and  its  related  concerns  are  not 
related  only  with  computing  aspects.  Service  oriented  architecture  and  other  characteristics  of 
cloud  computing  suggests  that  the  concept  of  cloud  computing  would  require  to  analyze  the 
practicality  in  line  with  social,  business,  technical  and  legal  perspectives  –  all  these  facets  will 
incorporate  security  issues  either  in  technical  or  strategic  form.  Regardless  of  the  nature  of 
security issues, it can be undoubtedly concluded that the severe adverse effects as a consequence 
of security breaches in cloud computing, the deployment of any form of cloud computing should 
deal with the security concerns corresponding to those of the safety critical systems.
