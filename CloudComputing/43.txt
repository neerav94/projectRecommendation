step. Distributed sensor, how to collect data, after collecting data how to manage, how search data, how to find the 
data structure analysis, this is the biggest problem. We now just put sensors in 'complex', do this step, but only the 
'network', to form a complete network. The application of  RFID end  user interface, to assist the  user  to read and 
write instructions and the logic of the middleware setup, gradually transforms the RFID atomic events for business 
users can understand, and demonstrate the use of visual interface, as is shown by figure1.

Due to the current RFID standard is not unified, and the Chinese national standard has not yet issued, taking into 
account  the  mobile  payment  application  characteristics  of  short  distance,  low  cost:  the  frequency  of  13.56MHz 
RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle 

                                                                                                                (2)

The Internet of things is the Internet of connected things. This has two meanings: first, the core and foundation of 
the  Internet  of  things  is  still  the  Internet,  is  the  extension  and  expansion  on  the  basis  of  Internet;  second,  the 
extension  and  expansion  of  the  client  to  any  goods  and  goods  between,  the  exchange  of  information  and

1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 
The reader is the most important infrastructure, RFID system in one aspect, the weak electromagnetic signals RFID 
tag  returns  through  the  antenna  RF  module  into  the  read  write  device  is  converted  to  digital  signals,  and  then 
through  the  reader  of  the  digital  signal  processing  unit  for  processing  plastic  necessary  for  its,  the  demodulating 
returned from information, complete the RFID tags identification or read / write operations; on the other hand, upper 
layer middleware and application software and reader interact, realize the operation instruction execution and data 
upload. 
 
The  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple  structure,  low  technical  difficulty,  more  in  line  with  China's  national 
conditions. The mobile is currently operating payment systems without major changes, only in the mobile payment 
platform on the increase in the RFID data support system and GPRS gateway can, can make full use of the existing 
resources of mobile network. 
 
The  Internet  of  things  to  a  new  generation  of  IT  technology  fully  used  in  all  walks  of  life,  in  particular,  is  the 
embedded  sensors  and  equipment  to  the  power  grid,  railway,  bridge,  tunnel,  highway,  building,  water  supply 
system, dam, oil and gas pipelines and other objects, and then the "Internet of things" and the Internet to integrate 
existing, implementation the integration of human society and the physical system, the integration of network, there 
are super powerful center computer group, to implement the  management and control of the real-time integration 
within the network of personnel, machinery, equipment and infrastructure, on this basis, the human can manage the 
production  and  life  in  a  more  precise  and  dynamic  way,  reach  "wisdom"  state,  improve  resource  utilization  and 
productivity, improve the relationship between man and nature [2]. 
 
Based on the RFID design of the microprocessor, the key information may not contain any encryption in ROM, but 
it does contain enough I/O, access control, encryption programs, and other information, these destructive attacks in 
non  vital.  Therefore,  for  the  use  of  microprocessor  RFID  design,  recommended  by  the  FLASH  or  EEPROM 
non-volatile memory stored procedures, as is shown by equation1.

Includes two kinds of antennas in RFID systems, a class is the RFID antenna on the label, because it has and RFID 
tags are integrated into a whole, so no separate discussion, another kind is the reader antenna, which can be built into 
the  reader,  RF  can  also  write  through  coaxial  cable  and  read  the  output  port  connected  to.  The  use  of  integrated 
antenna  transceiver  separation  technology  is  to  realize  the  transmitting  and  receiving  function.  Importance  of 
antenna  in  RFID  system  is  often  neglected  by  people,  in  the  practical  application;  the  design  parameters  of  the 
antenna are the main factors affecting the RFID system identification range. High performance of the antenna not 
only  has  good  impedance  matching  characteristics,  also  need  according  to  the  characteristics  of  application 
environment for directional properties, polarization and frequency characteristics of special design. 
 
In this paper, by analyzing the mobile payment development present situation and combining with China's national 
conditions,  puts  forward  the  scheme  of  implementation  and  the  overall  framework  for  GPRS  mobile  payment 
system based on RFID technology [3]. Compared with the existing domestic mobile payment system, the system has 
the  characteristics  of  high  efficiency,  convenient,  reliable;  at  the  same  time,  compared  with  other  RFID  based 
mobile  payment  system,  more  in  line  with  China's  national  conditions,  the  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple

step. Distributed sensor, how to collect data, after collecting data how to manage, how search data, how to find the 
data structure analysis, this is the biggest problem. We now just put sensors in 'complex', do this step, but only the 
'network', to form a complete network. The application of  RFID end  user interface, to assist the  user  to read and 
write instructions and the logic of the middleware setup, gradually transforms the RFID atomic events for business 
users can understand, and demonstrate the use of visual interface, as is shown by figure1.

Due to the current RFID standard is not unified, and the Chinese national standard has not yet issued, taking into 
account  the  mobile  payment  application  characteristics  of  short  distance,  low  cost:  the  frequency  of  13.56MHz 
RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle

sense of the IC industry chain, to the bad chips on the wafer testing stage removed to reduce unnecessary waste of 
the back-end processing, RFID chip is no exception. According to the characteristics of RFID chip, wafer testing 
include: RF performance testing, function testing and memory test. As with ordinary chips, if with the help of chip 
function to test logic and memory chip, the test will substantially increase the cost of. Usually adopt the principle of 
equivalent  test  design  test  state  additional  to  quickly  finish.  Because  the  test  state  provides  fast,  comprehensive

RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle

RFID  middleware  plays  a  mediating  role  between  RFID  hardware  and  the  application  program,  a  set  of  general 
application program interface provided by the application program can use middleware (API), which can realize the 
connection  to  the  RFID  reader.  In  this  way,  even  if  the  storage  RFID  tag  data  database  software  or  back-end 
application  increase  or  by  other  software  or  replaced,  read  and  write  RFID  reader  types  increase  occurs,  the

The RFID tag by coupling components and chips, each label is the only electronic coding, attached to the object on 
the target object. The package can have different forms, such as the common form of credit cards and small round 
form  etc..  From  the  energy  point  of  view,  the  label  can  be  divided  into  two  types:  passive  tags  and  active  tags. 
Passive tags itself with no power, when reading device to read on the label, energy generation antenna emits radio 
contact to RFID label, its light weight, small volume, life can be very long, but the transmission distance is limited. 
Active tags the battery energy, the identification distance is long, but its high price and short service life.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Internet of Things refers is to various information sensing equipment, and it is such as radio frequency identification 
(RFID) a huge network device, infrared sensors, global position system, laser scanner, gas sensors and other devices 
and Internet combined form. The purpose is to let all of the items are connected together; facilitate the identification, 
management  and  control.  Can  say,  the  Internet  of  things  is  the  pan  connected  in  network  technology  to  build  up 
object - based Internet, the connection may contain any time, any place and any connection object. 
 
Sensing  layer  and  the  development  of  networking  applications  based  primarily  through  radio  frequency 
identification (RFID) system to achieve automatic collection of RFID tags and identification [1]. RFID tags attached 
to the items can be tracked, thereby achieving global circulation, perception and information system connected to an 
electronic  code  to  read  the  label  (Electronic  Product  Code  EPC),  and  enter  the  network  information  system.  IOT 
network layer will build on the existing mobile communication networks and the Internet, based on the perception 
layer  collected  upload  data  storage,  query,  analysis,  mining,  understanding  and  perception  data  based 
decision-making  and  behavior,  and  to  achieve  this  series  of  data  management  and  processing  is  the  core  EPC 
middleware, which acts as the network layer of things important part of the past and provide various services for the 
application layer basis. 
 
Cloud computing refers to the IT infrastructure delivery and usage patterns, through the network to on-demand, easy 
extension  ways  to  obtain  needed  resources;  generalized  cloud  computing  service  delivery  and  usage  patterns, 
through the network to on-demand, scalable way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, 
Internet, but also other services. The core idea of cloud computing, the computing resources connected by a network 
of unified management and scheduling, constitute a computing resource pool to users on demand service. Provide 
the  resources  of  the  network  are  called  "cloud".  "The  cloud"  resources  can  be  extended  indefinitely  in  the  user's

view is, and  you can access  at any time, as  needed, to expand, pay per  use. Industrial  grade three layered cloud: 
cloud software platform, cloud, cloud equipment. 
 
The Internet of things is the Internet of connected things. This has two meanings: first, the core and foundation of 
the  Internet  of  things  is  still  the  Internet,  is  the  extension  and  expansion  on  the  basis  of  Internet;  second,  the 
extension  and  expansion  of  the  client  to  any  goods  and  goods  between,  the  exchange  of  information  and 
communication.  Cloud  security  through  a  large  number  of  client  network  of  software  behavior  in  the  network 
anomaly detection, to obtain up-to-date information, malicious Internet Trojan program, pushed to the Server end of 
the automatic analysis and processing, then the solution of virus and Trojan distributed to each client. The paper put 
forward the novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things. 
 
1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 
The reader is the most important infrastructure, RFID system in one aspect, the weak electromagnetic signals RFID 
tag  returns  through  the  antenna  RF  module  into  the  read  write  device  is  converted  to  digital  signals,  and  then 
through  the  reader  of  the  digital  signal  processing  unit  for  processing  plastic  necessary  for  its,  the  demodulating 
returned from information, complete the RFID tags identification or read / write operations; on the other hand, upper 
layer middleware and application software and reader interact, realize the operation instruction execution and data 
upload. 
 
The  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple  structure,  low  technical  difficulty,  more  in  line  with  China's  national 
conditions. The mobile is currently operating payment systems without major changes, only in the mobile payment 
platform on the increase in the RFID data support system and GPRS gateway can, can make full use of the existing 
resources of mobile network. 
 
The  Internet  of  things  to  a  new  generation  of  IT  technology  fully  used  in  all  walks  of  life,  in  particular,  is  the 
embedded  sensors  and  equipment  to  the  power  grid,  railway,  bridge,  tunnel,  highway,  building,  water  supply 
system, dam, oil and gas pipelines and other objects, and then the "Internet of things" and the Internet to integrate 
existing, implementation the integration of human society and the physical system, the integration of network, there 
are super powerful center computer group, to implement the  management and control of the real-time integration 
within the network of personnel, machinery, equipment and infrastructure, on this basis, the human can manage the 
production  and  life  in  a  more  precise  and  dynamic  way,  reach  "wisdom"  state,  improve  resource  utilization  and 
productivity, improve the relationship between man and nature [2]. 
 
Based on the RFID design of the microprocessor, the key information may not contain any encryption in ROM, but 
it does contain enough I/O, access control, encryption programs, and other information, these destructive attacks in 
non  vital.  Therefore,  for  the  use  of  microprocessor  RFID  design,  recommended  by  the  FLASH  or  EEPROM 
non-volatile memory stored procedures, as is shown by equation1.

Includes two kinds of antennas in RFID systems, a class is the RFID antenna on the label, because it has and RFID 
tags are integrated into a whole, so no separate discussion, another kind is the reader antenna, which can be built into 
the  reader,  RF  can  also  write  through  coaxial  cable  and  read  the  output  port  connected  to.  The  use  of  integrated 
antenna  transceiver  separation  technology  is  to  realize  the  transmitting  and  receiving  function.  Importance  of 
antenna  in  RFID  system  is  often  neglected  by  people,  in  the  practical  application;  the  design  parameters  of  the 
antenna are the main factors affecting the RFID system identification range. High performance of the antenna not 
only  has  good  impedance  matching  characteristics,  also  need  according  to  the  characteristics  of  application 
environment for directional properties, polarization and frequency characteristics of special design. 
 
In this paper, by analyzing the mobile payment development present situation and combining with China's national 
conditions,  puts  forward  the  scheme  of  implementation  and  the  overall  framework  for  GPRS  mobile  payment 
system based on RFID technology [3]. Compared with the existing domestic mobile payment system, the system has 
the  characteristics  of  high  efficiency,  convenient,  reliable;  at  the  same  time,  compared  with  other  RFID  based 
mobile  payment  system,  more  in  line  with  China's  national  conditions,  the  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple 
structure, make full use of existing resources and mobile network; taking into account is currently in the integrated 
test stage. 
 
The Internet of things needs many sensors, this must have an infrastructure, such as paved roads, and this is the first

step. Distributed sensor, how to collect data, after collecting data how to manage, how search data, how to find the 
data structure analysis, this is the biggest problem. We now just put sensors in 'complex', do this step, but only the 
'network', to form a complete network. The application of  RFID end  user interface, to assist the  user  to read and 
write instructions and the logic of the middleware setup, gradually transforms the RFID atomic events for business 
users can understand, and demonstrate the use of visual interface, as is shown by figure1.

Due to the current RFID standard is not unified, and the Chinese national standard has not yet issued, taking into 
account  the  mobile  payment  application  characteristics  of  short  distance,  low  cost:  the  frequency  of  13.56MHz 
RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle

of RFID: radio frequency  identification system, electronic  label also known as radio frequency tags, transponder, 
data carrier; the reader is also known as the readout device, scanner, communicator, reader (depending on whether 
the wireless electronic tag can overwrite data). 
 
For  a  general  sense  of  the  IC  industry  chain,  to  the  bad  chips  on  the  wafer  testing  stage  removed  to  reduce 
unnecessary  waste  of  the  back-end  processing,  RFID  chip  is  no  exception.  According  to  the  RFID  for  a  general 
sense of the IC industry chain, to the bad chips on the wafer testing stage removed to reduce unnecessary waste of 
the back-end processing, RFID chip is no exception. According to the characteristics of RFID chip, wafer testing 
include: RF performance testing, function testing and memory test. As with ordinary chips, if with the help of chip 
function to test logic and memory chip, the test will substantially increase the cost of. Usually adopt the principle of 
equivalent  test  design  test  state  additional  to  quickly  finish.  Because  the  test  state  provides  fast,  comprehensive 
access  to  the  memory  mechanism,  it  is  necessary  to  complete  the  on  wafer  testing,  the  testing  state  permanently 
closed. 
 
RFID ultra high frequency (UHF) tags for electromagnetic inverse scattering (Backscatter) characteristics, the metal 
(Metal)  and  liquid  (Liquid)  and  other  environmental  sensitive,  can  lead  to  passive  tag  the  working  frequency 
(Passive  tag)  to  the  metal  surfaces  or  liquid  environment  for  work,  but  these  problems  with  the  development  of 
technology has been fully resolved, for example, (SONTEC) label company that developed can well read application 
of  passive  tags  in  metal  or  liquid  environment,  to  facilitate  the  deployment  of  RFID  in  the  environment  or 
application case.

RFID  middleware  plays  a  mediating  role  between  RFID  hardware  and  the  application  program,  a  set  of  general 
application program interface provided by the application program can use middleware (API), which can realize the 
connection  to  the  RFID  reader.  In  this  way,  even  if  the  storage  RFID  tag  data  database  software  or  back-end 
application  increase  or  by  other  software  or  replaced,  read  and  write  RFID  reader  types  increase  occurs,  the 
application end without modification can also handle, solve the many to many connection maintenance complexity. 
 
The RFID tag by coupling components and chips, each label is the only electronic coding, attached to the object on 
the target object. The package can have different forms, such as the common form of credit cards and small round 
form  etc..  From  the  energy  point  of  view,  the  label  can  be  divided  into  two  types:  passive  tags  and  active  tags. 
Passive tags itself with no power, when reading device to read on the label, energy generation antenna emits radio 
contact to RFID label, its light weight, small volume, life can be very long, but the transmission distance is limited. 
Active tags the battery energy, the identification distance is long, but its high price and short service life.

3. Research of Cloud Computing based on RFID 
Cloud computing platform provides basic operating environment EPC application services and middleware system; 
meet  the  definition  of  service,  the  three  aspects  of  service  management  and  service  call  request  [6].  Define  the 
running environment of service support; the user can service definition to meet business needs. Service management 
major  provides  for  assembly,  service  choreography,  regulatory  and  other  functions,  to  meet  the  definition  of  a 
particular business process. While the service calls for service calls the user provided unified interface, convenient 
for the user to use cloud computing platform service. But in the use of complex enterprise, cloud computing, and not 
very good software architecture. In essence, in the abstract level, service is located in the middle of business and 
technology.   
 
Service  oriented  software  architecture  design  one  must  understand  the  dynamic  relationship  between  business 
requirements and can provide services, on the other hand, also want to understand the relationship between service 
and providing the services of the underlying technology.

The core of cloud computing is the high-speed information processing and transmission, its core idea is that large 
amounts  of  computing  resources  connected  by  a  network  of  unified  management  and  scheduling,  constitute  a 
computing resource pool to users on demand service. Simply put, the transmission network information in real time 
is something the reality of the existence of the real-time information, and the cloud computing more virtualization, 
which usually via the Internet provides dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. 
 
RFID  tags  are  commonly  known  as  electronic  tags,  also  known  as  the  transponder  (tag,  transponder,  responder), 
according to the working mode can be divided into active and passive (You Yuan) (Wu Yuan) two categories, this 
paper mainly studies the passive RFID tag and system. Passive RFID tag consists of tags and tag antenna or coil, 
realize  the  communication  between  the  reader  and  the  use  of  inductive  coupling  or  electromagnetic  backscatter 
coupling principle. 
 
Radio  frequency  label  information  written  by  wired  contact  mode,  generally  called  the  label  information  into  the 
device  programmer.  The  ability  to  tag  information  to  the  contact  type  usually  has  repeatedly  rewriting  [7].  For 
example,  in  the  written  lorry  tag  information  use  is  this  way.  Tags  in  the  complete  information  after  injection, 
usually need to  write entrance closed up, in order  to meet the application on  the  moisture-proof,  waterproof, anti 
fouling and other requirements. 
 
The upload data, the reader will RFID tag for atomic events to filter or a simple filter conditions, the processing for 
the  reader  the  event  after  the  upload,  data  exchange  between  the  flow  to  reduce  and  middleware  and  application 
software, therefore also integrated microprocessor and embedded system in many reader, the part of the middleware 
functions,  such  as  signal  state  control,  parity  error  checking  and  correction.  Future  reader  presents  intelligent, 
miniaturization  and  integration  trend,  will  also  have  the  front  control  more  powerful,  such  as  direct  and  other 
industrial equipment field interaction even as the controller for on-line scheduling.

cloud  terminal  operating  system,  all  kinds  of  mobile  phone  operating  system,  such  as  the  now  popular  little 
difference between single machine, operating system and the first do not do here discussion), it refers to the frame 
on  the  server,  storage,  network  and  other  hardware  resources  and  single  operating  system,  middleware,  database 
based software management huge basic hardware, soft resources on the cloud platform of integrated management 
system. 
 
Cloud computing is a computing model based on the Internet, the remote data center, tens of thousands of computer 
and server connected to a computer cloud. Therefore, cloud computing can even let you experience the 10 trillion 
times per second computing power, have so strong power can be simulated nuclear explosion, forecast and market 
development  trend  of  climate  change.  User’s  access  data  center  computer,  laptop,  mobile  phone  etc,  operate 
according to their own needs. 
 
In the use of microprocessor RFID, also need to consider the software designers to improve code efficiency abuse 
CPU components (such as the address counter) safety problems caused by the behavior of the. The program counter 
for each instruction cycle auto increment, if be used for reading and writing memory address generator, attack only 
prevent processors to implement JUMP, CALL and RETURN instructions disturb the reading order can be normal. 
That  is  slightly  with  laser  cutting  some  circuit  connection;  change  the  instruction  decoder,  the  program  counter 
circuit can realize the full access to memory.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of services and the use mode, refers to the network to on-demand, scalable 
way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, related to the Internet, or any other service. 
This  pool  of  resources  is  called  "cloud".  "Cloud"  is  a  virtual  computing  resources  can  be  self  maintenance  and 
management,  usually  for  some  large-scale  server  cluster,  including  the  calculation  of  servers,  storage  servers, 
broadband  resources  etc..  Cloud  computing  will  all  the  computing  resources  together,  and  realized  by  software 
automatic  control,  without  human  involvement  [8].  This  makes  the  application  provider  does  not  need  to  worry 
about trivial details, to be more focused on their own business, is conducive to innovation and cost reduction.

This  paper  presents  a  computing  platform  cloud  based  RFID  network  architecture,  the  operator  can  compute 
platform abstraction computation and storage resources by using cloud, integration  middleware services, dynamic 
allocation to require the use of the user or the application, development business applications need according to the 
standard application program interface call resources required for the on the cost, with the total amount of use of 
resources is proportional to the throughput of the system rather than a check than. So the user can only care of the 
business  logic  implementation,  operators  can  deploy  various  applications  and  services  to  the  cloud  computing 
platform and platform through the cloud computing control panel or interface provides application service. 
 
In  a  simple  RFID  system,  combined  with  existing  network  technology,  database  technology,  middleware 
technology,  to  build  a  network  consisting  of  a  large  number  of  readers  and  numerous  mobile  label,  larger  things 
become the development trend of RFID technology than Internet [9]. The Internet of things is widely used in many 
fields, in intelligent transportation, environmental protection, the work of the government, public security, security, 
intelligent home furnishing fire, industrial monitoring, elderly care, personal health etc.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Internet of Things refers is to various information sensing equipment, and it is such as radio frequency identification 
(RFID) a huge network device, infrared sensors, global position system, laser scanner, gas sensors and other devices 
and Internet combined form. The purpose is to let all of the items are connected together; facilitate the identification, 
management  and  control.  Can  say,  the  Internet  of  things  is  the  pan  connected  in  network  technology  to  build  up 
object - based Internet, the connection may contain any time, any place and any connection object. 
 
Sensing  layer  and  the  development  of  networking  applications  based  primarily  through  radio  frequency 
identification (RFID) system to achieve automatic collection of RFID tags and identification [1]. RFID tags attached 
to the items can be tracked, thereby achieving global circulation, perception and information system connected to an 
electronic  code  to  read  the  label  (Electronic  Product  Code  EPC),  and  enter  the  network  information  system.  IOT 
network layer will build on the existing mobile communication networks and the Internet, based on the perception 
layer  collected  upload  data  storage,  query,  analysis,  mining,  understanding  and  perception  data  based 
decision-making  and  behavior,  and  to  achieve  this  series  of  data  management  and  processing  is  the  core  EPC 
middleware, which acts as the network layer of things important part of the past and provide various services for the 
application layer basis. 
 
Cloud computing refers to the IT infrastructure delivery and usage patterns, through the network to on-demand, easy 
extension  ways  to  obtain  needed  resources;  generalized  cloud  computing  service  delivery  and  usage  patterns, 
through the network to on-demand, scalable way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, 
Internet, but also other services. The core idea of cloud computing, the computing resources connected by a network 
of unified management and scheduling, constitute a computing resource pool to users on demand service. Provide 
the  resources  of  the  network  are  called  "cloud".  "The  cloud"  resources  can  be  extended  indefinitely  in  the  user's

view is, and  you can access  at any time, as  needed, to expand, pay per  use. Industrial  grade three layered cloud: 
cloud software platform, cloud, cloud equipment. 
 
The Internet of things is the Internet of connected things. This has two meanings: first, the core and foundation of 
the  Internet  of  things  is  still  the  Internet,  is  the  extension  and  expansion  on  the  basis  of  Internet;  second,  the 
extension  and  expansion  of  the  client  to  any  goods  and  goods  between,  the  exchange  of  information  and 
communication.  Cloud  security  through  a  large  number  of  client  network  of  software  behavior  in  the  network 
anomaly detection, to obtain up-to-date information, malicious Internet Trojan program, pushed to the Server end of 
the automatic analysis and processing, then the solution of virus and Trojan distributed to each client. The paper put 
forward the novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things. 
 
1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 
The reader is the most important infrastructure, RFID system in one aspect, the weak electromagnetic signals RFID 
tag  returns  through  the  antenna  RF  module  into  the  read  write  device  is  converted  to  digital  signals,  and  then 
through  the  reader  of  the  digital  signal  processing  unit  for  processing  plastic  necessary  for  its,  the  demodulating 
returned from information, complete the RFID tags identification or read / write operations; on the other hand, upper 
layer middleware and application software and reader interact, realize the operation instruction execution and data 
upload. 
 
The  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple  structure,  low  technical  difficulty,  more  in  line  with  China's  national 
conditions. The mobile is currently operating payment systems without major changes, only in the mobile payment 
platform on the increase in the RFID data support system and GPRS gateway can, can make full use of the existing 
resources of mobile network. 
 
The  Internet  of  things  to  a  new  generation  of  IT  technology  fully  used  in  all  walks  of  life,  in  particular,  is  the 
embedded  sensors  and  equipment  to  the  power  grid,  railway,  bridge,  tunnel,  highway,  building,  water  supply 
system, dam, oil and gas pipelines and other objects, and then the "Internet of things" and the Internet to integrate 
existing, implementation the integration of human society and the physical system, the integration of network, there 
are super powerful center computer group, to implement the  management and control of the real-time integration 
within the network of personnel, machinery, equipment and infrastructure, on this basis, the human can manage the 
production  and  life  in  a  more  precise  and  dynamic  way,  reach  "wisdom"  state,  improve  resource  utilization  and 
productivity, improve the relationship between man and nature [2]. 
 
Based on the RFID design of the microprocessor, the key information may not contain any encryption in ROM, but 
it does contain enough I/O, access control, encryption programs, and other information, these destructive attacks in 
non  vital.  Therefore,  for  the  use  of  microprocessor  RFID  design,  recommended  by  the  FLASH  or  EEPROM 
non-volatile memory stored procedures, as is shown by equation1.

Includes two kinds of antennas in RFID systems, a class is the RFID antenna on the label, because it has and RFID 
tags are integrated into a whole, so no separate discussion, another kind is the reader antenna, which can be built into 
the  reader,  RF  can  also  write  through  coaxial  cable  and  read  the  output  port  connected  to.  The  use  of  integrated 
antenna  transceiver  separation  technology  is  to  realize  the  transmitting  and  receiving  function.  Importance  of 
antenna  in  RFID  system  is  often  neglected  by  people,  in  the  practical  application;  the  design  parameters  of  the 
antenna are the main factors affecting the RFID system identification range. High performance of the antenna not 
only  has  good  impedance  matching  characteristics,  also  need  according  to  the  characteristics  of  application 
environment for directional properties, polarization and frequency characteristics of special design. 
 
In this paper, by analyzing the mobile payment development present situation and combining with China's national 
conditions,  puts  forward  the  scheme  of  implementation  and  the  overall  framework  for  GPRS  mobile  payment 
system based on RFID technology [3]. Compared with the existing domestic mobile payment system, the system has 
the  characteristics  of  high  efficiency,  convenient,  reliable;  at  the  same  time,  compared  with  other  RFID  based 
mobile  payment  system,  more  in  line  with  China's  national  conditions,  the  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple 
structure, make full use of existing resources and mobile network; taking into account is currently in the integrated 
test stage. 
 
The Internet of things needs many sensors, this must have an infrastructure, such as paved roads, and this is the first

step. Distributed sensor, how to collect data, after collecting data how to manage, how search data, how to find the 
data structure analysis, this is the biggest problem. We now just put sensors in 'complex', do this step, but only the 
'network', to form a complete network. The application of  RFID end  user interface, to assist the  user  to read and 
write instructions and the logic of the middleware setup, gradually transforms the RFID atomic events for business 
users can understand, and demonstrate the use of visual interface, as is shown by figure1. 
 

Fig. 1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 

 

 
Due to the current RFID standard is not unified, and the Chinese national standard has not yet issued, taking into 
account  the  mobile  payment  application  characteristics  of  short  distance,  low  cost:  the  frequency  of  13.56MHz 
RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle

the wireless electronic tag can overwrite data). 
 
For  a  general  sense  of  the  IC  industry  chain,  to  the  bad  chips  on  the  wafer  testing  stage  removed  to  reduce 
unnecessary  waste  of  the  back-end  processing,  RFID  chip  is  no  exception.  According  to  the  RFID  for  a  general 
sense of the IC industry chain, to the bad chips on the wafer testing stage removed to reduce unnecessary waste of 
the back-end processing, RFID chip is no exception. According to the characteristics of RFID chip, wafer testing 
include: RF performance testing, function testing and memory test. As with ordinary chips, if with the help of chip 
function to test logic and memory chip, the test will substantially increase the cost of. Usually adopt the principle of 
equivalent  test  design  test  state  additional  to  quickly  finish.  Because  the  test  state  provides  fast,  comprehensive 
access  to  the  memory  mechanism,  it  is  necessary  to  complete  the  on  wafer  testing,  the  testing  state  permanently

RFID  middleware  plays  a  mediating  role  between  RFID  hardware  and  the  application  program,  a  set  of  general 
application program interface provided by the application program can use middleware (API), which can realize the 
connection  to  the  RFID  reader.  In  this  way,  even  if  the  storage  RFID  tag  data  database  software  or  back-end 
application  increase  or  by  other  software  or  replaced,  read  and  write  RFID  reader  types  increase  occurs,  the 
application end without modification can also handle, solve the many to many connection maintenance complexity. 
 
The RFID tag by coupling components and chips, each label is the only electronic coding, attached to the object on 
the target object. The package can have different forms, such as the common form of credit cards and small round 
form  etc..  From  the  energy  point  of  view,  the  label  can  be  divided  into  two  types:  passive  tags  and  active  tags. 
Passive tags itself with no power, when reading device to read on the label, energy generation antenna emits radio 
contact to RFID label, its light weight, small volume, life can be very long, but the transmission distance is limited. 
Active tags the battery energy, the identification distance is long, but its high price and short service life.

3. Research of Cloud Computing based on RFID 
Cloud computing platform provides basic operating environment EPC application services and middleware system; 
meet  the  definition  of  service,  the  three  aspects  of  service  management  and  service  call  request  [6].  Define  the 
running environment of service support; the user can service definition to meet business needs. Service management 
major  provides  for  assembly,  service  choreography,  regulatory  and  other  functions,  to  meet  the  definition  of  a 
particular business process. While the service calls for service calls the user provided unified interface, convenient 
for the user to use cloud computing platform service. But in the use of complex enterprise, cloud computing, and not 
very good software architecture. In essence, in the abstract level, service is located in the middle of business and 
technology.   
 
Service  oriented  software  architecture  design  one  must  understand  the  dynamic  relationship  between  business 
requirements and can provide services, on the other hand, also want to understand the relationship between service 
and providing the services of the underlying technology.

The core of cloud computing is the high-speed information processing and transmission, its core idea is that large 
amounts  of  computing  resources  connected  by  a  network  of  unified  management  and  scheduling,  constitute  a 
computing resource pool to users on demand service. Simply put, the transmission network information in real time 
is something the reality of the existence of the real-time information, and the cloud computing more virtualization, 
which usually via the Internet provides dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. 
 
RFID  tags  are  commonly  known  as  electronic  tags,  also  known  as  the  transponder  (tag,  transponder,  responder), 
according to the working mode can be divided into active and passive (You Yuan) (Wu Yuan) two categories, this 
paper mainly studies the passive RFID tag and system. Passive RFID tag consists of tags and tag antenna or coil, 
realize  the  communication  between  the  reader  and  the  use  of  inductive  coupling  or  electromagnetic  backscatter 
coupling principle. 
 
Radio  frequency  label  information  written  by  wired  contact  mode,  generally  called  the  label  information  into  the 
device  programmer.  The  ability  to  tag  information  to  the  contact  type  usually  has  repeatedly  rewriting  [7].  For 
example,  in  the  written  lorry  tag  information  use  is  this  way.  Tags  in  the  complete  information  after  injection, 
usually need to  write entrance closed up, in order  to meet the application on  the  moisture-proof,  waterproof, anti 
fouling and other requirements. 
 
The upload data, the reader will RFID tag for atomic events to filter or a simple filter conditions, the processing for 
the  reader  the  event  after  the  upload,  data  exchange  between  the  flow  to  reduce  and  middleware  and  application 
software, therefore also integrated microprocessor and embedded system in many reader, the part of the middleware 
functions,  such  as  signal  state  control,  parity  error  checking  and  correction.  Future  reader  presents  intelligent, 
miniaturization  and  integration  trend,  will  also  have  the  front  control  more  powerful,  such  as  direct  and  other 
industrial equipment field interaction even as the controller for on-line scheduling.

cloud  terminal  operating  system,  all  kinds  of  mobile  phone  operating  system,  such  as  the  now  popular  little 
difference between single machine, operating system and the first do not do here discussion), it refers to the frame 
on  the  server,  storage,  network  and  other  hardware  resources  and  single  operating  system,  middleware,  database 
based software management huge basic hardware, soft resources on the cloud platform of integrated management 
system. 
 
Cloud computing is a computing model based on the Internet, the remote data center, tens of thousands of computer 
and server connected to a computer cloud. Therefore, cloud computing can even let you experience the 10 trillion 
times per second computing power, have so strong power can be simulated nuclear explosion, forecast and market 
development  trend  of  climate  change.  User’s  access  data  center  computer,  laptop,  mobile  phone  etc,  operate 
according to their own needs. 
 
In the use of microprocessor RFID, also need to consider the software designers to improve code efficiency abuse 
CPU components (such as the address counter) safety problems caused by the behavior of the. The program counter 
for each instruction cycle auto increment, if be used for reading and writing memory address generator, attack only 
prevent processors to implement JUMP, CALL and RETURN instructions disturb the reading order can be normal. 
That  is  slightly  with  laser  cutting  some  circuit  connection;  change  the  instruction  decoder,  the  program  counter 
circuit can realize the full access to memory.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of services and the use mode, refers to the network to on-demand, scalable 
way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, related to the Internet, or any other service. 
This  pool  of  resources  is  called  "cloud".  "Cloud"  is  a  virtual  computing  resources  can  be  self  maintenance  and 
management,  usually  for  some  large-scale  server  cluster,  including  the  calculation  of  servers,  storage  servers, 
broadband  resources  etc..  Cloud  computing  will  all  the  computing  resources  together,  and  realized  by  software 
automatic  control,  without  human  involvement  [8].  This  makes  the  application  provider  does  not  need  to  worry 
about trivial details, to be more focused on their own business, is conducive to innovation and cost reduction. 
 
4. The novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things 
This  paper  presents  a  computing  platform  cloud  based  RFID  network  architecture,  the  operator  can  compute 
platform abstraction computation and storage resources by using cloud, integration  middleware services, dynamic 
allocation to require the use of the user or the application, development business applications need according to the 
standard application program interface call resources required for the on the cost, with the total amount of use of 
resources is proportional to the throughput of the system rather than a check than. So the user can only care of the 
business  logic  implementation,  operators  can  deploy  various  applications  and  services  to  the  cloud  computing 
platform and platform through the cloud computing control panel or interface provides application service. 
 
In  a  simple  RFID  system,  combined  with  existing  network  technology,  database  technology,  middleware 
technology,  to  build  a  network  consisting  of  a  large  number  of  readers  and  numerous  mobile  label,  larger  things 
become the development trend of RFID technology than Internet [9]. The Internet of things is widely used in many 
fields, in intelligent transportation, environmental protection, the work of the government, public security, security, 
intelligent home furnishing fire, industrial monitoring, elderly care, personal health etc.

Cloud  computing  has  three  levels,  the  first  is  the  infrastructure  as  a  service  (IAAS),  is  mainly  responsible  for 
communications,  computing,  storage  and  other  infrastructure  capacity;  the  two  platform  as  a  service  (PAAS),  is 
mainly responsible for development platform; the three is the software as a service (SAAS), is mainly responsible 
for providing application and software services. In order to realize the application of "cloud computing", first of all 
need  to  develop  the  industrial  chain,  this  has  to  go  through  a  very  long  process;  second,  many  new  technical 
backing, for support, business model can be fully established. 
 
Cloud computing is equivalent to the next Internet; also some people said that the Internet of things is equivalent to 
the next Internet, even bigger than the current internet. But in fact, want to do like the Internet now so fire, even 
bigger  than  the  Internet  now,  also  need  a  very  long  time  to.  Cloud  computing  and  the  Internet  of  things  will  be

These data need to be gathered to a certain storage and processing facilities through the  wireless sensor network, 
broadband Internet, and the use of cloud computing to carry these tasks have very significant price advantage; from 
the quality perspective, the use of cloud computing facilities in the data processing, analysis, mining, can be more 
rapid,  accurate,  intelligent  of  the  physical  world  management  and  control,  so  that  people  can  more  timely,  fine

The emergence of cloud computing will have a revolutionary impact on the future development of IT industry and 
information  industry.  It  will  be  centralized  to  decentralized,  management  ability,  revolutionizing  business 
ecosystem. Cloud computing and cloud on both sides of the traditional model of end it has incomparable advantage, 
provide more services for internal developers and business users in the cloud side, enhance the usage efficiency of 
infrastructure  and  resources  deployment  flexibility.  In  the  end,  the  ability  to  rapidly  deploy  applications  and 
services,  and  it  is  according  to  need  to  adjust  the  service  volume.  From  the  successful  case  of  the  current  cloud

INTRODUCTION 

 

Internet of Things refers is to various information sensing equipment, and it is such as radio frequency identification 
(RFID) a huge network device, infrared sensors, global position system, laser scanner, gas sensors and other devices 
and Internet combined form. The purpose is to let all of the items are connected together; facilitate the identification, 
management  and  control.  Can  say,  the  Internet  of  things  is  the  pan  connected  in  network  technology  to  build  up 
object - based Internet, the connection may contain any time, any place and any connection object. 
 
Sensing  layer  and  the  development  of  networking  applications  based  primarily  through  radio  frequency 
identification (RFID) system to achieve automatic collection of RFID tags and identification [1]. RFID tags attached 
to the items can be tracked, thereby achieving global circulation, perception and information system connected to an 
electronic  code  to  read  the  label  (Electronic  Product  Code  EPC),  and  enter  the  network  information  system.  IOT 
network layer will build on the existing mobile communication networks and the Internet, based on the perception 
layer  collected  upload  data  storage,  query,  analysis,  mining,  understanding  and  perception  data  based 
decision-making  and  behavior,  and  to  achieve  this  series  of  data  management  and  processing  is  the  core  EPC 
middleware, which acts as the network layer of things important part of the past and provide various services for the 
application layer basis. 
 
Cloud computing refers to the IT infrastructure delivery and usage patterns, through the network to on-demand, easy 
extension  ways  to  obtain  needed  resources;  generalized  cloud  computing  service  delivery  and  usage  patterns, 
through the network to on-demand, scalable way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, 
Internet, but also other services. The core idea of cloud computing, the computing resources connected by a network 
of unified management and scheduling, constitute a computing resource pool to users on demand service. Provide 
the  resources  of  the  network  are  called  "cloud".  "The  cloud"  resources  can  be  extended  indefinitely  in  the  user's

The Internet of things is the Internet of connected things. This has two meanings: first, the core and foundation of 
the  Internet  of  things  is  still  the  Internet,  is  the  extension  and  expansion  on  the  basis  of  Internet;  second,  the 
extension  and  expansion  of  the  client  to  any  goods  and  goods  between,  the  exchange  of  information  and 
communication.  Cloud  security  through  a  large  number  of  client  network  of  software  behavior  in  the  network 
anomaly detection, to obtain up-to-date information, malicious Internet Trojan program, pushed to the Server end of 
the automatic analysis and processing, then the solution of virus and Trojan distributed to each client. The paper put 
forward the novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things. 
 
1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 
The reader is the most important infrastructure, RFID system in one aspect, the weak electromagnetic signals RFID 
tag  returns  through  the  antenna  RF  module  into  the  read  write  device  is  converted  to  digital  signals,  and  then 
through  the  reader  of  the  digital  signal  processing  unit  for  processing  plastic  necessary  for  its,  the  demodulating 
returned from information, complete the RFID tags identification or read / write operations; on the other hand, upper 
layer middleware and application software and reader interact, realize the operation instruction execution and data 
upload. 
 
The  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple  structure,  low  technical  difficulty,  more  in  line  with  China's  national 
conditions. The mobile is currently operating payment systems without major changes, only in the mobile payment 
platform on the increase in the RFID data support system and GPRS gateway can, can make full use of the existing 
resources of mobile network. 
 
The  Internet  of  things  to  a  new  generation  of  IT  technology  fully  used  in  all  walks  of  life,  in  particular,  is  the 
embedded  sensors  and  equipment  to  the  power  grid,  railway,  bridge,  tunnel,  highway,  building,  water  supply 
system, dam, oil and gas pipelines and other objects, and then the "Internet of things" and the Internet to integrate 
existing, implementation the integration of human society and the physical system, the integration of network, there 
are super powerful center computer group, to implement the  management and control of the real-time integration 
within the network of personnel, machinery, equipment and infrastructure, on this basis, the human can manage the 
production  and  life  in  a  more  precise  and  dynamic  way,  reach  "wisdom"  state,  improve  resource  utilization  and 
productivity, improve the relationship between man and nature [2]. 
 
Based on the RFID design of the microprocessor, the key information may not contain any encryption in ROM, but 
it does contain enough I/O, access control, encryption programs, and other information, these destructive attacks in 
non  vital.  Therefore,  for  the  use  of  microprocessor  RFID  design,  recommended  by  the  FLASH  or  EEPROM 
non-volatile memory stored procedures, as is shown by equation1.

Includes two kinds of antennas in RFID systems, a class is the RFID antenna on the label, because it has and RFID 
tags are integrated into a whole, so no separate discussion, another kind is the reader antenna, which can be built into 
the  reader,  RF  can  also  write  through  coaxial  cable  and  read  the  output  port  connected  to.  The  use  of  integrated 
antenna  transceiver  separation  technology  is  to  realize  the  transmitting  and  receiving  function.  Importance  of 
antenna  in  RFID  system  is  often  neglected  by  people,  in  the  practical  application;  the  design  parameters  of  the 
antenna are the main factors affecting the RFID system identification range. High performance of the antenna not 
only  has  good  impedance  matching  characteristics,  also  need  according  to  the  characteristics  of  application 
environment for directional properties, polarization and frequency characteristics of special design. 
 
In this paper, by analyzing the mobile payment development present situation and combining with China's national 
conditions,  puts  forward  the  scheme  of  implementation  and  the  overall  framework  for  GPRS  mobile  payment 
system based on RFID technology [3]. Compared with the existing domestic mobile payment system, the system has 
the  characteristics  of  high  efficiency,  convenient,  reliable;  at  the  same  time,  compared  with  other  RFID  based 
mobile  payment  system,  more  in  line  with  China's  national  conditions,  the  system  has  the  advantages  of  simple 
structure, make full use of existing resources and mobile network; taking into account is currently in the integrated 
test stage. 
 
The Internet of things needs many sensors, this must have an infrastructure, such as paved roads, and this is the first

step. Distributed sensor, how to collect data, after collecting data how to manage, how search data, how to find the 
data structure analysis, this is the biggest problem. We now just put sensors in 'complex', do this step, but only the 
'network', to form a complete network. The application of  RFID end  user interface, to assist the  user  to read and 
write instructions and the logic of the middleware setup, gradually transforms the RFID atomic events for business 
users can understand, and demonstrate the use of visual interface, as is shown by figure1. 
 

Fig. 1. Development Internet of Things based on RFID 

 

 
Due to the current RFID standard is not unified, and the Chinese national standard has not yet issued, taking into 
account  the  mobile  payment  application  characteristics  of  short  distance,  low  cost:  the  frequency  of  13.56MHz 
RFID technology. With reference to the frequency point: ISO/IEC 10536, ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B and ISO/IEC 18000-3. Two standard is widely applied at present is ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 14443 TYPE 
A/B.  ISO/IEC  15693  belongs  to  the  loose  coupling  of  RFID  standard,  the  read  range  is  about  0~1m,  and  is 
compatible with the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. But the communication rate is relatively low, the single side carrier 
at low 6.62kbits/s, high speed 26.48kbits/s; double subcarrier is respectively 6.67kbits/s and 26.69kbits/s. 
 
Only  when  the  read  and  write  device,  RFID  can  play  its  role.  RFID  reading  and  writing  device  with  RFID  card 
reader, RFID reader, RFID reader module, currently on the market the high price of CY-TZB-203, CY-TZB-208, 
YW-201 and YW-601U and YW-601R etc.. These devices can be RFID data read or write, and do good encryption. 
Long  distance  is  CY-RFS-205;  CY-RFS-209,  WV-CID1500,  and  WV-VID1500  distance  can  be  up  to  1.5 
kilometers. 
 
One  is  the  application  layer,  data  processing,  it  covers  every  field  of  national  economy  and  society,  including 
electricity, medical, transportation, environmental protection, bank, logistics, industry, agriculture, city management, 
home  furnishing  life,  its  function  can  include  payment,  monitoring,  security,  location,  inventory,  forecast,  for  the 
government,  enterprises,  social  organizations,  individuals,  families.  This  is  the  Internet  as  an  important 
manifestation of depth information. Another is the terminal equipment layer, providing man-machine interface [4]. 
The Internet of things is "matter is net", but in the end is to people-oriented, operation and control or the needs of 
people, but here the man-machine interface has been far beyond human computer interaction concept, but refers to 
various kinds of equipment and people with the application with the interaction is shown by equation2.

RFID power consumption is an important issue in the process of chip design, the series solution of higher efficiency, 
more suitable for integrated circuit design. But in terms of security, the parallel scheme is a more ideal choice: the 
parallel discharge circuit will change the power supply ripple amplitude and control in the smallest possible range, 
making the supply current consumption fluctuation suppression in after the rectifier circuit. The AC signal can not 
reflect such antennas at both ends of any internal base band system (mainly is the microprocessor) state difference. 
 
The RFID system at least comprises two parts of the electronic tag and reader. RFID readers (Reader) for wireless 
communication through the antenna and RFID tag, can achieve a write operation to the tag identification codes and 
memory data read or. The typical reader contains a  high frequency  module (transmitter and receiver), the control 
unit and the reader antenna. RFID read and write can be roughly divided into the following several low-frequency 
reader, high-frequency reader, UHF reader, dual frequency reader, the 433MHz active reader. The working principle

of RFID: radio frequency  identification system, electronic  label also known as radio frequency tags, transponder, 
data carrier; the reader is also known as the readout device, scanner, communicator, reader (depending on whether 
the wireless electronic tag can overwrite data). 
 
For  a  general  sense  of  the  IC  industry  chain,  to  the  bad  chips  on  the  wafer  testing  stage  removed  to  reduce 
unnecessary  waste  of  the  back-end  processing,  RFID  chip  is  no  exception.  According  to  the  RFID  for  a  general 
sense of the IC industry chain, to the bad chips on the wafer testing stage removed to reduce unnecessary waste of 
the back-end processing, RFID chip is no exception. According to the characteristics of RFID chip, wafer testing 
include: RF performance testing, function testing and memory test. As with ordinary chips, if with the help of chip 
function to test logic and memory chip, the test will substantially increase the cost of. Usually adopt the principle of 
equivalent  test  design  test  state  additional  to  quickly  finish.  Because  the  test  state  provides  fast,  comprehensive 
access  to  the  memory  mechanism,  it  is  necessary  to  complete  the  on  wafer  testing,  the  testing  state  permanently 
closed.

(Metal)  and  liquid  (Liquid)  and  other  environmental  sensitive,  can  lead  to  passive  tag  the  working  frequency 
(Passive  tag)  to  the  metal  surfaces  or  liquid  environment  for  work,  but  these  problems  with  the  development  of 
technology has been fully resolved, for example, (SONTEC) label company that developed can well read application 
of  passive  tags  in  metal  or  liquid  environment,  to  facilitate  the  deployment  of  RFID  in  the  environment  or

Internet of things networking by communication layered system architecture, including perceptual extension system, 
transmission system, operation management system and a variety of applications, support different communication 
protocols  at  different  levels  [5].  Power  system  (MEMS)  system  on  chip  (SOC),  the  rapid  development  of 
technology,  wireless  communication  and  low  power  embedded,  bred  a  wireless  sensor  network  (Wireless  Sensor 
Networks,  WSN),  and  its  low  power  consumption,  low  cost,  distributed  and  self-organization  characteristics  has 
brought a revolution in information perception. Wireless sensor network is deployed in the monitoring area by the 
large number of cheap micro sensor nodes, through wireless communication to form a multi hop ad hoc network.

RFID  middleware  plays  a  mediating  role  between  RFID  hardware  and  the  application  program,  a  set  of  general 
application program interface provided by the application program can use middleware (API), which can realize the 
connection  to  the  RFID  reader.  In  this  way,  even  if  the  storage  RFID  tag  data  database  software  or  back-end 
application  increase  or  by  other  software  or  replaced,  read  and  write  RFID  reader  types  increase  occurs,  the 
application end without modification can also handle, solve the many to many connection maintenance complexity. 
 
The RFID tag by coupling components and chips, each label is the only electronic coding, attached to the object on 
the target object. The package can have different forms, such as the common form of credit cards and small round 
form  etc..  From  the  energy  point  of  view,  the  label  can  be  divided  into  two  types:  passive  tags  and  active  tags. 
Passive tags itself with no power, when reading device to read on the label, energy generation antenna emits radio 
contact to RFID label, its light weight, small volume, life can be very long, but the transmission distance is limited. 
Active tags the battery energy, the identification distance is long, but its high price and short service life.

3. Research of Cloud Computing based on RFID 
Cloud computing platform provides basic operating environment EPC application services and middleware system; 
meet  the  definition  of  service,  the  three  aspects  of  service  management  and  service  call  request  [6].  Define  the 
running environment of service support; the user can service definition to meet business needs. Service management 
major  provides  for  assembly,  service  choreography,  regulatory  and  other  functions,  to  meet  the  definition  of  a 
particular business process. While the service calls for service calls the user provided unified interface, convenient 
for the user to use cloud computing platform service. But in the use of complex enterprise, cloud computing, and not 
very good software architecture. In essence, in the abstract level, service is located in the middle of business and 
technology.   
 
Service  oriented  software  architecture  design  one  must  understand  the  dynamic  relationship  between  business 
requirements and can provide services, on the other hand, also want to understand the relationship between service 
and providing the services of the underlying technology.

The core of cloud computing is the high-speed information processing and transmission, its core idea is that large 
amounts  of  computing  resources  connected  by  a  network  of  unified  management  and  scheduling,  constitute  a 
computing resource pool to users on demand service. Simply put, the transmission network information in real time 
is something the reality of the existence of the real-time information, and the cloud computing more virtualization, 
which usually via the Internet provides dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. 
 
RFID  tags  are  commonly  known  as  electronic  tags,  also  known  as  the  transponder  (tag,  transponder,  responder), 
according to the working mode can be divided into active and passive (You Yuan) (Wu Yuan) two categories, this 
paper mainly studies the passive RFID tag and system. Passive RFID tag consists of tags and tag antenna or coil, 
realize  the  communication  between  the  reader  and  the  use  of  inductive  coupling  or  electromagnetic  backscatter 
coupling principle. 
 
Radio  frequency  label  information  written  by  wired  contact  mode,  generally  called  the  label  information  into  the 
device  programmer.  The  ability  to  tag  information  to  the  contact  type  usually  has  repeatedly  rewriting  [7].  For 
example,  in  the  written  lorry  tag  information  use  is  this  way.  Tags  in  the  complete  information  after  injection, 
usually need to  write entrance closed up, in order  to meet the application on  the  moisture-proof,  waterproof, anti 
fouling and other requirements. 
 
The upload data, the reader will RFID tag for atomic events to filter or a simple filter conditions, the processing for 
the  reader  the  event  after  the  upload,  data  exchange  between  the  flow  to  reduce  and  middleware  and  application 
software, therefore also integrated microprocessor and embedded system in many reader, the part of the middleware 
functions,  such  as  signal  state  control,  parity  error  checking  and  correction.  Future  reader  presents  intelligent, 
miniaturization  and  integration  trend,  will  also  have  the  front  control  more  powerful,  such  as  direct  and  other 
industrial equipment field interaction even as the controller for on-line scheduling.

cloud  terminal  operating  system,  all  kinds  of  mobile  phone  operating  system,  such  as  the  now  popular  little 
difference between single machine, operating system and the first do not do here discussion), it refers to the frame 
on  the  server,  storage,  network  and  other  hardware  resources  and  single  operating  system,  middleware,  database 
based software management huge basic hardware, soft resources on the cloud platform of integrated management 
system. 
 
Cloud computing is a computing model based on the Internet, the remote data center, tens of thousands of computer 
and server connected to a computer cloud. Therefore, cloud computing can even let you experience the 10 trillion 
times per second computing power, have so strong power can be simulated nuclear explosion, forecast and market 
development  trend  of  climate  change.  User’s  access  data  center  computer,  laptop,  mobile  phone  etc,  operate 
according to their own needs. 
 
In the use of microprocessor RFID, also need to consider the software designers to improve code efficiency abuse 
CPU components (such as the address counter) safety problems caused by the behavior of the. The program counter 
for each instruction cycle auto increment, if be used for reading and writing memory address generator, attack only 
prevent processors to implement JUMP, CALL and RETURN instructions disturb the reading order can be normal. 
That  is  slightly  with  laser  cutting  some  circuit  connection;  change  the  instruction  decoder,  the  program  counter 
circuit can realize the full access to memory.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of services and the use mode, refers to the network to on-demand, scalable 
way to obtain the desired service. This service can be IT and software, related to the Internet, or any other service. 
This  pool  of  resources  is  called  "cloud".  "Cloud"  is  a  virtual  computing  resources  can  be  self  maintenance  and 
management,  usually  for  some  large-scale  server  cluster,  including  the  calculation  of  servers,  storage  servers, 
broadband  resources  etc..  Cloud  computing  will  all  the  computing  resources  together,  and  realized  by  software 
automatic  control,  without  human  involvement  [8].  This  makes  the  application  provider  does  not  need  to  worry 
about trivial details, to be more focused on their own business, is conducive to innovation and cost reduction. 
 
4. The novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things 
This  paper  presents  a  computing  platform  cloud  based  RFID  network  architecture,  the  operator  can  compute 
platform abstraction computation and storage resources by using cloud, integration  middleware services, dynamic 
allocation to require the use of the user or the application, development business applications need according to the 
standard application program interface call resources required for the on the cost, with the total amount of use of 
resources is proportional to the throughput of the system rather than a check than. So the user can only care of the 
business  logic  implementation,  operators  can  deploy  various  applications  and  services  to  the  cloud  computing 
platform and platform through the cloud computing control panel or interface provides application service. 
 
In  a  simple  RFID  system,  combined  with  existing  network  technology,  database  technology,  middleware 
technology,  to  build  a  network  consisting  of  a  large  number  of  readers  and  numerous  mobile  label,  larger  things 
become the development trend of RFID technology than Internet [9]. The Internet of things is widely used in many 
fields, in intelligent transportation, environmental protection, the work of the government, public security, security, 
intelligent home furnishing fire, industrial monitoring, elderly care, personal health etc.

Cloud  computing  has  three  levels,  the  first  is  the  infrastructure  as  a  service  (IAAS),  is  mainly  responsible  for 
communications,  computing,  storage  and  other  infrastructure  capacity;  the  two  platform  as  a  service  (PAAS),  is 
mainly responsible for development platform; the three is the software as a service (SAAS), is mainly responsible 
for providing application and software services. In order to realize the application of "cloud computing", first of all 
need  to  develop  the  industrial  chain,  this  has  to  go  through  a  very  long  process;  second,  many  new  technical 
backing, for support, business model can be fully established. 
 
Cloud computing is equivalent to the next Internet; also some people said that the Internet of things is equivalent to 
the next Internet, even bigger than the current internet. But in fact, want to do like the Internet now so fire, even 
bigger  than  the  Internet  now,  also  need  a  very  long  time  to.  Cloud  computing  and  the  Internet  of  things  will  be

These data need to be gathered to a certain storage and processing facilities through the  wireless sensor network, 
broadband Internet, and the use of cloud computing to carry these tasks have very significant price advantage; from 
the quality perspective, the use of cloud computing facilities in the data processing, analysis, mining, can be more 
rapid,  accurate,  intelligent  of  the  physical  world  management  and  control,  so  that  people  can  more  timely,  fine 
management of the physical world, so as to achieve the "wisdom" of the state, greatly improve the utilization rate of 
resources and the level of social productive forces. It can be seen by Figure3, the cloud computing cost performance 
with  its  powerful  processing  capability,  storage  capability  and  high  ratio,  naturally  become  the  network  support 
platform.

The emergence of cloud computing will have a revolutionary impact on the future development of IT industry and 
information  industry.  It  will  be  centralized  to  decentralized,  management  ability,  revolutionizing  business 
ecosystem. Cloud computing and cloud on both sides of the traditional model of end it has incomparable advantage, 
provide more services for internal developers and business users in the cloud side, enhance the usage efficiency of 
infrastructure  and  resources  deployment  flexibility.  In  the  end,  the  ability  to  rapidly  deploy  applications  and 
services,  and  it  is  according  to  need  to  adjust  the  service  volume.  From  the  successful  case  of  the  current  cloud 
computing can be seen in this technology greatly improves the performance of the Internet information technology, 
has  the  huge  computation  and  memory  cost  advantage,  make  the  IT  resources  and  capacity  configuration  like 
utilities as required, convenient use, low price. China Mobile has the world's largest user data warehouse. 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
Sensors  on  the  content  networking  acquisition  timing  information  needs  to  be  transmitted  through  the  network, 
because of its large and huge, forming a mass of information, in the process of transmission, in order to ensure the 
accuracy and timeliness of data, must adapt to a variety of heterogeneous networks and protocols. Also, the Internet 
of  things  not  only  provides  the  connection  of  the  sensor,  it’s  also  has  the  ability  to  implement  the  intelligent 
processing, intelligent control of objects. The Internet of things sensor and intelligent processing combination, the 
use  of  cloud  computing,  pattern  recognition  and  intelligent  technology,  expand  its  application  areas.  Information 
obtained from the sensors in the analysis, processing and handling of meaningful data, in order to adapt to different 
needs of users not, find new applications and application mode. 
 
The paper put forward the novel analysis model of Cloud computing based on RFID Internet of things. RFID tag 
stores  a  unique  code  to  mark  the  reality  of  objects,  the  business  process  related  information  stored  in  a  data 
container,  when  the  code  is  used  as  the  query  value  to  obtain  relevant  information  through  the  network.  RFID 
technology can also identify  multiple tags, fast recognition speed, combined  with Internet technology, can realize 
the information sharing in the global range.
