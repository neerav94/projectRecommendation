applications due to their innate characters. Also, it is 
impossible that a mobile device is always online, the 
offline  solution  of  the  device  need  be  considered  as

2.  Background 

a 

From 

simple  viewpoint  mobile 

cloud 
computing can be thought of as infrastructure where 
data  and  processing  could  happen  outside  of  the 
mobile  device,  enabling  new  types  of  applications 
such  as  context-aware  mobile  social  networks.  As  a 
result, many mobile cloud applications are not limited 
to powerful smartphones, but to a broad range of less 
advanced mobile phones and, therefore, to a broader 
subscriber audience. MCC can be simply divided into 
mobile computing and cloud computing. The mobile 
devices can be laptops, PDA, smartphones and so on, 
which connect with a base station or a hotspot by a 
radio link such as 3G, Wi-Fi or GPRS. Although the 
client  is  changed  from  PCs  or  fixed  machines  to 
mobile  devices,  the  main  concept  is  still  cloud 
computing.  Mobile  users  send  service  requests  to  
the    cloud    through    a    web    browser    or    desktop  
application.    The  management  component  of  cloud 
then  allocates  resources  to  the  request  to  establish 
connection,  while  the  monitoring  and  calculating 
functions of mobile cloud computing are implemented 
to ensure the QoS until the connection is completed.

or thick client platforms like mobile phones, laptops,

Resource  pooling:  The  provider’s  computing 
resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple  consumers 
using  a  multi-tenant  model,  with  different  physical 
and  virtual  resources  dynamically  assigned  and 
reassigned  according  to  consumer  demand.  The 
customer does not have control or knowledge over the 
exact location of the provided resources. Examples of 
resources 
include  storage,  processing,  memory, 
network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid  elasticity:  Capabilities  can  be  rapidly  and 
elastically  provisioned,  in  some  cases  automatically, 
to  quickly  scale  out  and  rapidly  released  to  quickly

control  and  optimize  resource  use  by  leveraging  a 
metering  capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction 
appropriate  to  the  type  of  service  (e.g.  storage, 
processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). 
2.2 Service Models 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  The  capability 
provided  to  the  consumer  is  to  use  the  provider’s 
applications  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 
applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a web bro wser 
(e.g.,  web-based  email).  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
with  the  possible  exception  of  limited  user-specific 
application configuration settings. 
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure 
acquired 
applications  created  using  programming  languages 
and  tools  supported  by  the  provider.  The  consumer 
does  not  manage  or  control  the  underlying  cloud 
infrastructure  including  network,  servers,  operating 
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications 
application  hosting 
environment configurations. 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to provision processing, 
storage, networks, and  other  fundamental  computing 
resources  where  the  consumer is  able  to  deploy  and 
run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating 
systems  and  applications.  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
but  has  control  over  operating  systems;  storage, 
deployed applications, and possibly limited control of 
select networking components (e.g. host firewalls).

solely for an organization. It may be managed by the 
organization or a third party and may exist on premise 
or off premise. 
Community  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is 
shared  by  several  organizations  and  supports  a 
specific  community  that  has  shared  concerns  (e.g., 
mission, 
and 
compliance  considerations).  It  may  be  managed  by 
the organization s or a third party and may  exist on 
premise or off premise. 
Public  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  or  a  large  industry 
group and is owned by an organization selling cloud 
services. 
Hybrid  Cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
composition  of 
(private, 
community, or public) that remain unique entities but 
are  bound  together  by  standardized  or  proprietary 
technology that enables data and application portabilit

Mobile  devices  generally  mobile  phones 
communicate with the mobile networks with the help 
of  base  stations,  access  points  and/or  satellite.  The 
information sent from the mobile devices are operated 
on the central processors, servers and database on the 
mobile 
side.  The  main 
communication is composed from both stakeholders. 
Generally,  the  mobile  network  provider  is  like  a 
middleware with SOAP or RESTful WS services and 
delivers  the  service  result  taken  from  the  cloud 
providers to the mobile client. There are also different 
applications  of  MCC  by  using  the  cloud  services 
without using network provider, directly through the 
internet [3]. The mobile network operator delivers the 
mobile  clients’  requests  to  the  cloud  through  the 
internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

which resources are provided to a local client on an 
on-demand basis, usually by means of the internet. 
At    the    same    time,    Cloud    Computing    has  
emerged    as   a   phenomenon  that   represents   the  
way   by  which  IT   services  and functionality are 
charged  for and  delivered.  NIST  (National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology,  USA)  definition  [3] 
from  September,  2011  released  in  its  “Special 
Publication 800-145” of Cloud Computing is: 

“Cloud  Computing  is  a  model  for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared 
pool  of  configurable  resources  (e.g.  networks, 
servers,  storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can 
rapidly  be  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.” 

It can be thought as a combination of the cloud 
computing and mobile environment. The cloud can be 
used for   power and storage, as mobile devices don’t 
have powerful resources compared to traditional

computation devices. Today, there are already lots of 
good  examples  of  MCC  applications  including 
Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  such  applications. 
However,  the  most  of  applications  still  do  most  of 
the  calculation  and  data  storage  on  the  mobile 
devices themselves, not in the cloud.

a  mobile

environment  brings  numerous 
and 
problems. Mobile devices cannot handle complicated 
applications due to their innate characters. Also, it is 
impossible that a mobile device is always online, the 
offline  solution  of  the  device  need  be  considered  as 
well. The absence of standards, security and privacy, 
elastic mobile applications requirement may obstruct 
the  development  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  In 
order to understand the challenges and provide further 
scope  for  research,  an  understanding  of  this  novel 
approach is essential. This paper introduces the basic 
model  of  MCC,  its  background,  key  technology, 
challenges, current research status and future research 
perspectives.  
2.  Background 

a 

From 

simple  viewpoint  mobile 

cloud 
computing can be thought of as infrastructure where 
data  and  processing  could  happen  outside  of  the 
mobile  device,  enabling  new  types  of  applications 
such  as  context-aware  mobile  social  networks.  As  a 
result, many mobile cloud applications are not limited 
to powerful smartphones, but to a broad range of less 
advanced mobile phones and, therefore, to a broader 
subscriber audience. MCC can be simply divided into 
mobile computing and cloud computing. The mobile 
devices can be laptops, PDA, smartphones and so on, 
which connect with a base station or a hotspot by a 
radio link such as 3G, Wi-Fi or GPRS. Although the 
client  is  changed  from  PCs  or  fixed  machines  to 
mobile  devices,  the  main  concept  is  still  cloud 
computing.  Mobile  users  send  service  requests  to  
the    cloud    through    a    web    browser    or    desktop  
application.    The  management  component  of  cloud 
then  allocates  resources  to  the  request  to  establish 
connection,  while  the  monitoring  and  calculating 
functions of mobile cloud computing are implemented 
to ensure the QoS until the connection is completed.

over  the  network  and  accessed  through  standard 
mechanisms that promote use  by heterogeneous thin

or thick client platforms like mobile phones, laptops, 
PDAs etc. 
Resource  pooling:  The  provider’s  computing 
resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple  consumers 
using  a  multi-tenant  model,  with  different  physical 
and  virtual  resources  dynamically  assigned  and 
reassigned  according  to  consumer  demand.  The 
customer does not have control or knowledge over the 
exact location of the provided resources. Examples of 
resources 
include  storage,  processing,  memory, 
network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid  elasticity:  Capabilities  can  be  rapidly  and 
elastically  provisioned,  in  some  cases  automatically, 
to  quickly  scale  out  and  rapidly  released  to  quickly 
scale in. 
Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  and  optimize  resource  use  by  leveraging  a 
metering  capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction 
appropriate  to  the  type  of  service  (e.g.  storage, 
processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). 
2.2 Service Models 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  The  capability 
provided  to  the  consumer  is  to  use  the  provider’s 
applications  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 
applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a web bro wser 
(e.g.,  web-based  email).  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
with  the  possible  exception  of  limited  user-specific 
application configuration settings. 
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure 
acquired 
applications  created  using  programming  languages 
and  tools  supported  by  the  provider.  The  consumer 
does  not  manage  or  control  the  underlying  cloud 
infrastructure  including  network,  servers,  operating 
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications 
application  hosting 
environment configurations. 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to provision processing, 
storage, networks, and  other  fundamental  computing 
resources  where  the  consumer is  able  to  deploy  and 
run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating 
systems  and  applications.  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
but  has  control  over  operating  systems;  storage, 
deployed applications, and possibly limited control of 
select networking components (e.g. host firewalls).

An overview of basic Mobile Cloud Computing 
was  presented  in  the  previous  section.  A  general 
architecture in a broader sense was as depicted in Fig

2.3 Operation Models 
Private  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  operated 
solely for an organization. It may be managed by the 
organization or a third party and may exist on premise 
or off premise. 
Community  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is 
shared  by  several  organizations  and  supports  a 
specific  community  that  has  shared  concerns  (e.g., 
mission, 
and 
compliance  considerations).  It  may  be  managed  by 
the organization s or a third party and may  exist on 
premise or off premise. 
Public  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  or  a  large  industry 
group and is owned by an organization selling cloud 
services. 
Hybrid  Cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
composition  of 
(private, 
community, or public) that remain unique entities but 
are  bound  together  by  standardized  or  proprietary 
technology that enables data and application portabilit 
y  (e.g.,  cloud  bursting  for  load-balancing  between 
clouds).

Fig: 4. Mobile Cloud Computing Architecture 
The  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  architecture  is 
basically shown in the Figure. The main architecture 
is  composed  from  the  components:  mobile  users, 
mobile  operators,  internet  service  providers  (ISP), 
cloud service providers, respectively [3].  

network 

provider 

Mobile  devices  generally  mobile  phones 
communicate with the mobile networks with the help 
of  base  stations,  access  points  and/or  satellite.  The 
information sent from the mobile devices are operated 
on the central processors, servers and database on the 
mobile 
side.  The  main 
communication is composed from both stakeholders. 
Generally,  the  mobile  network  provider  is  like  a 
middleware with SOAP or RESTful WS services and 
delivers  the  service  result  taken  from  the  cloud 
providers to the mobile client. There are also different 
applications  of  MCC  by  using  the  cloud  services 
without using network provider, directly through the 
internet [3]. The mobile network operator delivers the 
mobile  clients’  requests  to  the  cloud  through  the 
internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

WLAN.  As  a  result,  handling  like  heterogeneous 
network  connectivity  becomes  very  hard  while 
satisfying mobile cloud computing requirements such 
as  connectivity  which  is  always  on,  on-demand 
scalable  connectivity,  and  the  energy  efficiency  of 
mobile  devices.  This  problem  can  be  solved  10  by 
using standardized interfaces and messaging protocols 
to reach, manage and distribute contents.  
Pricing:  Using  multiple  services  in  mobile  requires 
with both mobile network provider and cloud service 
provider.  However,  these  providers  have  different 
methods of payment and prices for services, features 
and facilities. Therefore, this has possibility of leading 
to many problems like how to determine price, how 
the  price  could  be  shared  among  the  providers  or 
parties,  and  how  the  subscribers  can  pay.  As  an 
example, when a mobile user wants to run a not free 
mobile application on the cloud, this participates three 
stakeholders as one of them is application provider for 
application  licence,  second  one  is  mobile  network 
provider  for  used  data  communication  from  user  to 
cloud,  and third  one  is  cloud  provider  for  providing 
and running application on the cloud.  
Computing Side Challenges  

In  the  cloud  side,  main  obstacles  and  solutions 

are listed below:  
Computing  Offloading:  As  mentioned  previous 
parts, offloading is one of the key features of MCC to 
improve  the  battery  life  time  and  to  increase  the 
applications’  performance  by  using  the  cloud 
. 
Although this solution is very useful in the means of 
process  power  and  storage,  it  can  be  ineffective  in 
some situations. For example, the mobile devices can 
consume more energy for an application by using the 
cloud  rather  than  local  processing.  For  a  critical 
threshold,  using  the  mobile  device  instead  of  cloud 
might be more effective.  Therefore, a problem arises 
that  the  optimum  way  of  trade-off  between  the 
communication  and  calculation  costs  have  to  be 
estimated  or  calculated  for  mobile  applications. The 
communication  cost  mainly  depends  on  the  size  of 
transmitted data and the bandwidth of network, while 
the computation cost can be defined by the means of 
computation time. The optimal decisions of a program 
partitioning can be made at a runtime dynamically, by 
using and operating cost algorithms.  

As an example, an approach for deciding which 
components of Java programs should be offloaded can 
be given. In this approach, a Java program is divided 
into methods and uses several parameters like size of 
methods  or  line  of  codes  to  calculate  execution  11 
costs 
this  approach 
compares  the  local  execution  costs  of  each  method 

these  methods.  Then,

4.  Challenges 
Computing 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  Mobile 
Cloud  Computing  has  many  benefits  and  good 
application  examples  for  mobile  users  and  service 
providers. On the other hand, as mentioned in some 
parts, there are also some challenges related to cloud 
computing and mobile networks communication. This 
section gives some explanation about these obstacles 
and solutions.  
Mobile Side Challenges  

In  the  mobile  network  side,  main  obstacles  and 

solutions are listed below:  
Low Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the one of important 
issues  in  mobile  cloud  environment  because  mobile 
network resource is much smaller compared with the 
traditional networks. Therefore, P2P Media Streaming 
for  sharing  limited  bandwidth among  the  users  who 
are  located  nearby  in  the  same  area  for  the  same 
content such as the same video. By this method, each 
user transmits or exchanges parts of the same content 
with the other users, which is resulted in improvement 
of content quality, especially for videos.  
Availability: Network failures, out of signal errors, or 
high  traffic  related  poor  performance  problems  are 
main threats to prevent users to connect to the cloud. 
But there are some solutions to help mobile users in 
the case of any disconnection from the clouds. One of 
them  is  Wi-Fi  Based  Multihop  MANET.  It  is  a 
distributed  content  sharing  protocol  for  the  situation 
without any infrastructure. In this mechanism, nearby 
nodes  are  detected  in  case  of  the  failure  of  direct 
connection to the cloud. In this case, instead of having 
a link directly to the cloud, mobile user can connect to 
the cloud through neighboring nodes. Although there 
are  some  considers  about  security  issues  for  such 
mechanisms, these issues can also be solved.  
Heterogeneity:  There  are  types  of  networks  which 
are used simultaneously in mobile environment such 
as  WCDMA,  GPRS,  WiMAX,  CDMA2000,  and

Challenges in MCC  

Mobile  cloud  computing  is  an  technique  or  model  in  which  mobile 
applications  are  built,  powered  and  hosted  using  cloud      computing 
technology.  A  mobile  cloud  approach  enables  developers  to  build 
applications designed specifically for mobile users without being bound 
by the mobile operating system and the computing or memory capacity 
of  the  Smartphone.  Mobile  cloud  computing  centered  are  generally 
accessed  via  a  mobile  browser  from  a  remote  web  server,  typically 
without  the  need  for  installing  a  client  application  on  the  recipient 
phone.    This  concept  is  also  sometimes  referred  to  as  MoClo,  a 
combination  of  Mobile  Cloud.  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (MCC)  has 
revolutionized  the  way  in  which mobile  subscribers  across  the  globe 
leverage  services  on  the  go.  The  mobile  devices  have  evolved  from 
mere devices that enabled voice calls only a few  years back to smart 
devices  that  enable  the  user  to  access  value  added  services  anytime, 
anywhere.  MCC

internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

WLAN.  As  a  result,  handling  like  heterogeneous 
network  connectivity  becomes  very  hard  while 
satisfying mobile cloud computing requirements such 
as  connectivity  which  is  always  on,  on-demand 
scalable  connectivity,  and  the  energy  efficiency  of 
mobile  devices.  This  problem  can  be  solved  10  by 
using standardized interfaces and messaging protocols 
to reach, manage and distribute contents.  
Pricing:  Using  multiple  services  in  mobile  requires 
with both mobile network provider and cloud service 
provider.  However,  these  providers  have  different 
methods of payment and prices for services, features 
and facilities. Therefore, this has possibility of leading 
to many problems like how to determine price, how 
the  price  could  be  shared  among  the  providers  or 
parties,  and  how  the  subscribers  can  pay.  As  an 
example, when a mobile user wants to run a not free 
mobile application on the cloud, this participates three 
stakeholders as one of them is application provider for 
application  licence,  second  one  is  mobile  network 
provider  for  used  data  communication  from  user  to 
cloud,  and third  one  is  cloud  provider  for  providing 
and running application on the cloud.  
Computing Side Challenges  

In  the  cloud  side,  main  obstacles  and  solutions 

are listed below:  
Computing  Offloading:  As  mentioned  previous 
parts, offloading is one of the key features of MCC to 
improve  the  battery  life  time  and  to  increase  the 
applications’  performance  by  using  the  cloud 
. 
Although this solution is very useful in the means of 
process  power  and  storage,  it  can  be  ineffective  in 
some situations. For example, the mobile devices can 
consume more energy for an application by using the 
cloud  rather  than  local  processing.  For  a  critical 
threshold,  using  the  mobile  device  instead  of  cloud 
might be more effective.  Therefore, a problem arises 
that  the  optimum  way  of  trade-off  between  the 
communication  and  calculation  costs  have  to  be 
estimated  or  calculated  for  mobile  applications. The 
communication  cost  mainly  depends  on  the  size  of 
transmitted data and the bandwidth of network, while 
the computation cost can be defined by the means of 
computation time. The optimal decisions of a program 
partitioning can be made at a runtime dynamically, by 
using and operating cost algorithms.  

As an example, an approach for deciding which 
components of Java programs should be offloaded can 
be given. In this approach, a Java program is divided 
into methods and uses several parameters like size of 
methods  or  line  of  codes  to  calculate  execution  11 
costs 
this  approach 
compares  the  local  execution  costs  of  each  method 

these  methods.  Then,

4.  Challenges 
Computing 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  Mobile 
Cloud  Computing  has  many  benefits  and  good 
application  examples  for  mobile  users  and  service 
providers. On the other hand, as mentioned in some 
parts, there are also some challenges related to cloud 
computing and mobile networks communication. This 
section gives some explanation about these obstacles 
and solutions.  
Mobile Side Challenges  

In  the  mobile  network  side,  main  obstacles  and 

solutions are listed below:  
Low Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the one of important 
issues  in  mobile  cloud  environment  because  mobile 
network resource is much smaller compared with the 
traditional networks. Therefore, P2P Media Streaming 
for  sharing  limited  bandwidth among  the  users  who 
are  located  nearby  in  the  same  area  for  the  same 
content such as the same video. By this method, each 
user transmits or exchanges parts of the same content 
with the other users, which is resulted in improvement 
of content quality, especially for videos.  
Availability: Network failures, out of signal errors, or 
high  traffic  related  poor  performance  problems  are 
main threats to prevent users to connect to the cloud. 
But there are some solutions to help mobile users in 
the case of any disconnection from the clouds. One of 
them  is  Wi-Fi  Based  Multihop  MANET.  It  is  a 
distributed  content  sharing  protocol  for  the  situation 
without any infrastructure. In this mechanism, nearby 
nodes  are  detected  in  case  of  the  failure  of  direct 
connection to the cloud. In this case, instead of having 
a link directly to the cloud, mobile user can connect to 
the cloud through neighboring nodes. Although there 
are  some  considers  about  security  issues  for  such 
mechanisms, these issues can also be solved.  
Heterogeneity:  There  are  types  of  networks  which 
are used simultaneously in mobile environment such 
as  WCDMA,  GPRS,  WiMAX,  CDMA2000,  and 

ICARI

with  the  remote  (cloud)  execution  costs  to  make  an 
optimal execution decision.  
Security:  Trust is the main issue of the subscribers in 
the  mobile  platform.  When  it  comes  to  MCC,  this 
issiue  gains  more  importance  as  the  stakeholders 
increase in the cloud environment for protecting user 
privacy  and  data/application  secrecy.  One  of  the 
security issue is mobile device users, other one is the 
data privacy and security.  As mobile users, there are 
several  security  threats  like  malicious  codes  like 
virus, worm, and Trojan horses and privacy concerns 
when thinking of integrated global positioning system 
(GPS) devices that can lead subscribers to be tracked. 
To overcome this issue, there is security programmes 
can  be  runned  on  mobile  devices  to  prevent  illegal 
threats, but these programs use big portion of mobile 
device  resources  while  running.  Therefore  there  is 
some  approaches  moves  threat  detection  capabilities 
from  mobile  devices  to  cloud.  For  example,  Cloud 
AV  platform  provides  a  multiple  service  based  on 
both cloud and mobile device for malware detection . 
A simple and lightweight part of the application runs 
on  the  mobile  device  and  it  communicates  with  the 
major  component  of  the  application  in  the  cloud. 
Detection capabilities are moved to the cloud, as the 
mobile  agent  application  sends  file  parts  in  the 
background to the cloud server application 
Authentication:  Although 
application 
developers and mobile users benefit from storing and 
processing  a  large  amount  of  data/applications  on  a 
cloud, they should be careful of dealing with the data 
or applications in terms of rights and authentication. 
Users have tendency of using small passwords while 
accessing external resources, so there is need for more 
secure authentication mechanisms. As an example of 
authentication method, TrustCube can be given. It is a 
policy  based  cloud  authentication  mechanism  using 
open  standards  and  it  integrates  various  types  of 
authentication.  
Data Access: While cloud services are increasing, the 
number  of  data  resources  on  the  cloud  rapidly 
increases.  Therefore,  dealing  with 
these  data 
resources  in  the  means  of  storing,  managing  or 
accessing  becomes  very  challenging.  Cloud  storage 
providers 
input-output 
operations executes jobs generally, in file level which 
increases 
the  cost  of  data  communication  and 
processing  for  mobile  clients.  There  are  some 
solutions  that  providing  an  efficient  and  less  costly 
way of block level based I/O algorithms instead of file 
level.  In  this  solution,  not  all  the  file  transmitted, 
instead  data  blocks  are  transmitted,  in  case  of 
necessity, which is very useful by the means of time 
and network  communication  cost.  13  In  addition,  to

increase  data  access  efficiency,  mobile  devices  can 
use local storage as cache for specific parts of cloud 
service to increase access speed and reduce network 
necessity. Here, there is also a problem, as we cannot 
store large data on the mobile device storage cache, so 
some data management or data selections mechanisms 
have to be applied to determine which parts or amount 
of data can be cached or used from cloud. There are 
several  other  issues  related  to  implementation  of 
MCC. A few of them have been listed below: 
4.1 Absence of standards

conventional 

Inspite  of  the  various  advantages  of  Cloud 
computing 
computing 
techniques,  there  is  no  accepted  open  standard 
available.  Portability  and  interoperability  is  also 
impossible  between  different  cloud  computing 
Service  Providers  (CCSP). This  prevents  the  service 
providers to widely deploy and quickly develop Cloud 
computing. Customers are reluctant to transform their 
current  datacenters  and  IT  resources 
to  cloud 
platforms  owing  to  a  number  of  unsolved  technical 
problems  that  exist  in  these  platforms.  Some  of  the 
problems existing due to a lack of open standards are 
the following: 
  Limited scalability: Owing to the rapid growth, 
none of the CCSPs can meet all the requirements 
of all the users. 

  Unreliable 

availability 

service: 
Dependence  on  a  single  CCSP’s  service  can 
result in a bottleneck in the event of a breakdown 
of a service.

  Service provider lock-in: Absence of portability 
makes  it  impossible  for  data  and  application 
transfer among CCSPs, consequently customer is 
locked to a CCSP. 

  Unable to deploy service over multiple CCSPs: 
Absence  of  interoperability  makes  it  impossible 
for application to be scaled over multiple CCSPs. 
In  view  of  the  afore  mentioned  disadvantages, 
B.Rochwerger et al. have introduced a solution called 
Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation  (OCCF)  in  [21], 
that  solves  the  problems  of  interoperability  and 
portability among various CCSPs. However, the move 
to  a  common  cloud  standard  is  impossible  because 
most  of  the  cloud  computing  firms  have  their  own 
APIs and for setting those up lots of funds were spent.

Challenges in MCC  

Mobile  cloud  computing  is  an  technique  or  model  in  which  mobile 
applications  are  built,  powered  and  hosted  using  cloud      computing 
technology.  A  mobile  cloud  approach  enables  developers  to  build 
applications designed specifically for mobile users without being bound 
by the mobile operating system and the computing or memory capacity 
of  the  Smartphone.  Mobile  cloud  computing  centered  are  generally 
accessed  via  a  mobile  browser  from  a  remote  web  server,  typically 
without  the  need  for  installing  a  client  application  on  the  recipient 
phone.    This  concept  is  also  sometimes  referred  to  as  MoClo,  a 
combination  of  Mobile  Cloud.  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (MCC)  has 
revolutionized  the  way  in  which mobile  subscribers  across  the  globe 
leverage  services  on  the  go.  The  mobile  devices  have  evolved  from 
mere devices that enabled voice calls only a few  years back to smart 
devices  that  enable  the  user  to  access  value  added  services  anytime, 
anywhere.  MCC 
the  mobile 
environment  and  overcomes  obstacles  related  to  performance  (as 
battery life, storage, and bandwidth), environment (e.g. heterogeneity, 
scalability, availability) and security (e.g. reliability and privacy).

1.  Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  defined  as  the  trend  in 
which resources are provided to a local client on an 
on-demand basis, usually by means of the internet. 
At    the    same    time,    Cloud    Computing    has  
emerged    as   a   phenomenon  that   represents   the  
way   by  which  IT   services  and functionality are 
charged  for and  delivered.  NIST  (National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology,  USA)  definition  [3] 
from  September,  2011  released  in  its  “Special 
Publication 800-145” of Cloud Computing is: 

“Cloud  Computing  is  a  model  for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared 
pool  of  configurable  resources  (e.g.  networks, 
servers,  storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can 
rapidly  be  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.” 

It can be thought as a combination of the cloud 
computing and mobile environment. The cloud can be 
used for   power and storage, as mobile devices don’t 
have powerful resources compared to traditional

computation devices. Today, there are already lots of 
good  examples  of  MCC  applications  including 
Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  such  applications. 
However,  the  most  of  applications  still  do  most  of 
the  calculation  and  data  storage  on  the  mobile 
devices themselves, not in the cloud. 

The general architecture is as depicted in Fig 1

Delivering 

in 
challenges 

a  mobile 
services 
environment  brings  numerous 
and 
problems. Mobile devices cannot handle complicated 
applications due to their innate characters. Also, it is 
impossible that a mobile device is always online, the 
offline  solution  of  the  device  need  be  considered  as 
well. The absence of standards, security and privacy, 
elastic mobile applications requirement may obstruct 
the  development  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  In 
order to understand the challenges and provide further 
scope  for  research,  an  understanding  of  this  novel 
approach is essential. This paper introduces the basic 
model  of  MCC,  its  background,  key  technology, 
challenges, current research status and future research 
perspectives.  
2.  Background 

a 

From 

simple  viewpoint  mobile 

cloud 
computing can be thought of as infrastructure where 
data  and  processing  could  happen  outside  of  the 
mobile  device,  enabling  new  types  of  applications 
such  as  context-aware  mobile  social  networks.  As  a 
result, many mobile cloud applications are not limited 
to powerful smartphones, but to a broad range of less 
advanced mobile phones and, therefore, to a broader 
subscriber audience. MCC can be simply divided into 
mobile computing and cloud computing. The mobile 
devices can be laptops, PDA, smartphones and so on, 
which connect with a base station or a hotspot by a 
radio link such as 3G, Wi-Fi or GPRS. Although the 
client  is  changed  from  PCs  or  fixed  machines  to 
mobile  devices,  the  main  concept  is  still  cloud 
computing.  Mobile  users  send  service  requests  to  
the    cloud    through    a    web    browser    or    desktop  
application.    The  management  component  of  cloud 
then  allocates  resources  to  the  request  to  establish 
connection,  while  the  monitoring  and  calculating 
functions of mobile cloud computing are implemented 
to ensure the QoS until the connection is completed.

The  cloud  model  as  defined  by  NIST  promotes

On-demand 
can 
unilaterally stipulation computing capabilities, such as 
server 
time  and  network  storage,  as  needed 
automatically  without  requiring  human  interaction 
with each service provider. 
Broad  network  access:  Capabilities  are  available 
over  the  network  and  accessed  through  standard 
mechanisms that promote use  by heterogeneous thin 

service:  A 

consumer 

self 

 

 

ICARI 

or thick client platforms like mobile phones, laptops, 
PDAs etc. 
Resource  pooling:  The  provider’s  computing 
resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple  consumers 
using  a  multi-tenant  model,  with  different  physical 
and  virtual  resources  dynamically  assigned  and 
reassigned  according  to  consumer  demand.  The 
customer does not have control or knowledge over the 
exact location of the provided resources. Examples of 
resources 
include  storage,  processing,  memory, 
network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid  elasticity:  Capabilities  can  be  rapidly  and 
elastically  provisioned,  in  some  cases  automatically, 
to  quickly  scale  out  and  rapidly  released  to  quickly 
scale in. 
Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  and  optimize  resource  use  by  leveraging  a 
metering  capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction 
appropriate  to  the  type  of  service  (e.g.  storage, 
processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). 
2.2 Service Models 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  The  capability 
provided  to  the  consumer  is  to  use  the  provider’s 
applications  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 
applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a web bro wser 
(e.g.,  web-based  email).  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
with  the  possible  exception  of  limited  user-specific 
application configuration settings. 
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure 
acquired 
applications  created  using  programming  languages 
and  tools  supported  by  the  provider.  The  consumer 
does  not  manage  or  control  the  underlying  cloud 
infrastructure  including  network,  servers,  operating 
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications 
application  hosting 
environment configurations. 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to provision processing, 
storage, networks, and  other  fundamental  computing 
resources  where  the  consumer is  able  to  deploy  and 
run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating 
systems  and  applications.  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
but  has  control  over  operating  systems;  storage, 
deployed applications, and possibly limited control of 
select networking components (e.g. host firewalls).

An overview of basic Mobile Cloud Computing 
was  presented  in  the  previous  section.  A  general 
architecture in a broader sense was as depicted in Fig

2.3 Operation Models 
Private  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  operated 
solely for an organization. It may be managed by the 
organization or a third party and may exist on premise 
or off premise. 
Community  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is 
shared  by  several  organizations  and  supports  a 
specific  community  that  has  shared  concerns  (e.g., 
mission, 
and 
compliance  considerations).  It  may  be  managed  by 
the organization s or a third party and may  exist on 
premise or off premise. 
Public  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  or  a  large  industry 
group and is owned by an organization selling cloud 
services. 
Hybrid  Cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
composition  of 
(private, 
community, or public) that remain unique entities but 
are  bound  together  by  standardized  or  proprietary 
technology that enables data and application portabilit 
y  (e.g.,  cloud  bursting  for  load-balancing  between 
clouds).

Fig: 4. Mobile Cloud Computing Architecture 
The  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  architecture  is 
basically shown in the Figure. The main architecture 
is  composed  from  the  components:  mobile  users, 
mobile  operators,  internet  service  providers  (ISP), 
cloud service providers, respectively [3].  

network 

provider 

Mobile  devices  generally  mobile  phones 
communicate with the mobile networks with the help 
of  base  stations,  access  points  and/or  satellite.  The 
information sent from the mobile devices are operated 
on the central processors, servers and database on the 
mobile 
side.  The  main 
communication is composed from both stakeholders. 
Generally,  the  mobile  network  provider  is  like  a 
middleware with SOAP or RESTful WS services and 
delivers  the  service  result  taken  from  the  cloud 
providers to the mobile client. There are also different 
applications  of  MCC  by  using  the  cloud  services 
without using network provider, directly through the 
internet [3]. The mobile network operator delivers the 
mobile  clients’  requests  to  the  cloud  through  the 
internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

WLAN.  As  a  result,  handling  like  heterogeneous 
network  connectivity  becomes  very  hard  while 
satisfying mobile cloud computing requirements such 
as  connectivity  which  is  always  on,  on-demand 
scalable  connectivity,  and  the  energy  efficiency  of 
mobile  devices.  This  problem  can  be  solved  10  by 
using standardized interfaces and messaging protocols 
to reach, manage and distribute contents.  
Pricing:  Using  multiple  services  in  mobile  requires 
with both mobile network provider and cloud service 
provider.  However,  these  providers  have  different 
methods of payment and prices for services, features 
and facilities. Therefore, this has possibility of leading 
to many problems like how to determine price, how 
the  price  could  be  shared  among  the  providers  or 
parties,  and  how  the  subscribers  can  pay.  As  an 
example, when a mobile user wants to run a not free 
mobile application on the cloud, this participates three 
stakeholders as one of them is application provider for 
application  licence,  second  one  is  mobile  network 
provider  for  used  data  communication  from  user  to 
cloud,  and third  one  is  cloud  provider  for  providing 
and running application on the cloud.  
Computing Side Challenges  

In  the  cloud  side,  main  obstacles  and  solutions 

are listed below:  
Computing  Offloading:  As  mentioned  previous 
parts, offloading is one of the key features of MCC to 
improve  the  battery  life  time  and  to  increase  the 
applications’  performance  by  using  the  cloud 
. 
Although this solution is very useful in the means of 
process  power  and  storage,  it  can  be  ineffective  in 
some situations. For example, the mobile devices can 
consume more energy for an application by using the 
cloud  rather  than  local  processing.  For  a  critical 
threshold,  using  the  mobile  device  instead  of  cloud 
might be more effective.  Therefore, a problem arises 
that  the  optimum  way  of  trade-off  between  the 
communication  and  calculation  costs  have  to  be 
estimated  or  calculated  for  mobile  applications. The 
communication  cost  mainly  depends  on  the  size  of 
transmitted data and the bandwidth of network, while 
the computation cost can be defined by the means of 
computation time. The optimal decisions of a program 
partitioning can be made at a runtime dynamically, by 
using and operating cost algorithms.  

As an example, an approach for deciding which 
components of Java programs should be offloaded can 
be given. In this approach, a Java program is divided 
into methods and uses several parameters like size of 
methods  or  line  of  codes  to  calculate  execution  11 
costs 
this  approach 
compares  the  local  execution  costs  of  each  method

Computing 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  Mobile 
Cloud  Computing  has  many  benefits  and  good 
application  examples  for  mobile  users  and  service 
providers. On the other hand, as mentioned in some 
parts, there are also some challenges related to cloud 
computing and mobile networks communication. This 
section gives some explanation about these obstacles 
and solutions.  
Mobile Side Challenges  

In  the  mobile  network  side,  main  obstacles  and 

solutions are listed below:  
Low Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the one of important 
issues  in  mobile  cloud  environment  because  mobile 
network resource is much smaller compared with the 
traditional networks. Therefore, P2P Media Streaming 
for  sharing  limited  bandwidth among  the  users  who 
are  located  nearby  in  the  same  area  for  the  same 
content such as the same video. By this method, each 
user transmits or exchanges parts of the same content 
with the other users, which is resulted in improvement 
of content quality, especially for videos.  
Availability: Network failures, out of signal errors, or 
high  traffic  related  poor  performance  problems  are 
main threats to prevent users to connect to the cloud. 
But there are some solutions to help mobile users in 
the case of any disconnection from the clouds. One of 
them  is  Wi-Fi  Based  Multihop  MANET.  It  is  a 
distributed  content  sharing  protocol  for  the  situation 
without any infrastructure. In this mechanism, nearby 
nodes  are  detected  in  case  of  the  failure  of  direct 
connection to the cloud. In this case, instead of having 
a link directly to the cloud, mobile user can connect to 
the cloud through neighboring nodes. Although there 
are  some  considers  about  security  issues  for  such 
mechanisms, these issues can also be solved.  
Heterogeneity:  There  are  types  of  networks  which 
are used simultaneously in mobile environment such 
as  WCDMA,  GPRS,  WiMAX,  CDMA2000,  and

with  the  remote  (cloud)  execution  costs  to  make  an 
optimal execution decision.  
Security:  Trust is the main issue of the subscribers in 
the  mobile  platform.  When  it  comes  to  MCC,  this 
issiue  gains  more  importance  as  the  stakeholders 
increase in the cloud environment for protecting user 
privacy  and  data/application  secrecy.  One  of  the 
security issue is mobile device users, other one is the 
data privacy and security.  As mobile users, there are 
several  security  threats  like  malicious  codes  like 
virus, worm, and Trojan horses and privacy concerns 
when thinking of integrated global positioning system 
(GPS) devices that can lead subscribers to be tracked. 
To overcome this issue, there is security programmes 
can  be  runned  on  mobile  devices  to  prevent  illegal 
threats, but these programs use big portion of mobile 
device  resources  while  running.  Therefore  there  is 
some  approaches  moves  threat  detection  capabilities 
from  mobile  devices  to  cloud.  For  example,  Cloud 
AV  platform  provides  a  multiple  service  based  on 
both cloud and mobile device for malware detection . 
A simple and lightweight part of the application runs 
on  the  mobile  device  and  it  communicates  with  the 
major  component  of  the  application  in  the  cloud. 
Detection capabilities are moved to the cloud, as the 
mobile  agent  application  sends  file  parts  in  the 
background to the cloud server application 
Authentication:  Although 
application 
developers and mobile users benefit from storing and 
processing  a  large  amount  of  data/applications  on  a 
cloud, they should be careful of dealing with the data 
or applications in terms of rights and authentication. 
Users have tendency of using small passwords while 
accessing external resources, so there is need for more 
secure authentication mechanisms. As an example of 
authentication method, TrustCube can be given. It is a 
policy  based  cloud  authentication  mechanism  using 
open  standards  and  it  integrates  various  types  of 
authentication.  
Data Access: While cloud services are increasing, the 
number  of  data  resources  on  the  cloud  rapidly 
increases.  Therefore,  dealing  with 
these  data 
resources  in  the  means  of  storing,  managing  or 
accessing  becomes  very  challenging.  Cloud  storage 
providers 
input-output 
operations executes jobs generally, in file level which 
increases 
the  cost  of  data  communication  and 
processing  for  mobile  clients.  There  are  some 
solutions  that  providing  an  efficient  and  less  costly 
way of block level based I/O algorithms instead of file 
level.  In  this  solution,  not  all  the  file  transmitted, 
instead  data  blocks  are  transmitted,  in  case  of 
necessity, which is very useful by the means of time 
and network  communication  cost.  13  In  addition,  to

increase  data  access  efficiency,  mobile  devices  can 
use local storage as cache for specific parts of cloud 
service to increase access speed and reduce network 
necessity. Here, there is also a problem, as we cannot 
store large data on the mobile device storage cache, so 
some data management or data selections mechanisms 
have to be applied to determine which parts or amount 
of data can be cached or used from cloud. There are 
several  other  issues  related  to  implementation  of 
MCC. A few of them have been listed below: 
4.1 Absence of standards 

the 

over 

conventional 

Inspite  of  the  various  advantages  of  Cloud 
computing 
computing 
techniques,  there  is  no  accepted  open  standard 
available.  Portability  and  interoperability  is  also 
impossible  between  different  cloud  computing 
Service  Providers  (CCSP). This  prevents  the  service 
providers to widely deploy and quickly develop Cloud 
computing. Customers are reluctant to transform their 
current  datacenters  and  IT  resources 
to  cloud 
platforms  owing  to  a  number  of  unsolved  technical 
problems  that  exist  in  these  platforms.  Some  of  the 
problems existing due to a lack of open standards are 
the following: 
  Limited scalability: Owing to the rapid growth, 
none of the CCSPs can meet all the requirements 
of all the users. 

  Unreliable 

availability 

service: 
Dependence  on  a  single  CCSP’s  service  can 
result in a bottleneck in the event of a breakdown 
of a service.

a 

  Service provider lock-in: Absence of portability 
makes  it  impossible  for  data  and  application 
transfer among CCSPs, consequently customer is 
locked to a CCSP. 

  Unable to deploy service over multiple CCSPs: 
Absence  of  interoperability  makes  it  impossible 
for application to be scaled over multiple CCSPs. 
In  view  of  the  afore  mentioned  disadvantages, 
B.Rochwerger et al. have introduced a solution called 
Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation  (OCCF)  in  [21], 
that  solves  the  problems  of  interoperability  and 
portability among various CCSPs. However, the move 
to  a  common  cloud  standard  is  impossible  because 
most  of  the  cloud  computing  firms  have  their  own 
APIs and for setting those up lots of funds were spent.

4.2 Access Schemes 

MCC  will  be  deployed  in  a  heterogeneous 
access  scenario  in  terms  of  Wireless  Network 
Interfaces.  Mobile  nodes  access  the  Cloud  through 
different  radio  access 
technologies  viz.  GPRS, 
WLAN, LTE, WiMAX, CDMA2000, WCDMA etc. 
Mobile  Cloud  Computing  requires  the  following 
features: 
  MCC requires an “always-on” connectivity for a 

low data rate cloud control signaling channel 

  MCC requires an “on-demand” available wireless 

connectivity with a scalable link bandwidth 

  MCC  requires  a  network  selection  and  use  that 

takes energy-efficiency and costs into account 
Access management is a critical aspect of MCC. 
A  possible  solution  is  to  use  context  and  location 
information to optimize mobile access, as proposed 
by  A.Klein et al. in [23]. Deploying MCC utilizing 
the context information, such as device locations and 
capabilities  and  user  profiles,  can  be  used  by  the 
mobile  cloud  server  to  locally  optimize  the  access 
management. 
4.3 Security 

Mobile devices today have all the functionalities 
of  a  standard  computer.  This,  like  for  the  standards 
computers,  poses  a  security  threat  to  the  mobile 
devices as well. The threat detection services run on 
the  mobile  devices  to  combat  these  security  threats, 
warrant intensive usage of resources, both in terms of 
computation  and  power.  A  possible  solution  is  to 
move  these  detection  services  to  the  cloud.  It  saves 
the  device  CPU  and  memory  requirements  with 
increased  bandwidth  as  the  price  to  be  paid.  This 
approach has the following benefits: 
  Better detection of malicious software 
  Reduced on-device resource consumption 
  Reduced on-device software complexity 
4.4 Elastic Application Models 

for  peak 

Cloud  computing  services  are  scalable,  via 
dynamic provisioning of resources on a fine grained, 
self-service basis near real-time, without users having 
to  engineer 
loads.  This  requirement 
particularly  manifests  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing 
due to the intrinsic limitations of mobile devices. For 
example,  the  iPhone  4s  is  equipped  with  800  MHz 
CPU, 512 MB RAM allowing about 8 hrs of talktime 
and 14.4 Mbps speed  on HSDPA 4G network, [24]. 
Compared to today’s  PC and server platforms, these

5.  Applications  Of  Mobile  Cloud 

Computing 
Mobile  applications  have  been  used  widely  and 
have a huge share in a global mobile market, because 
of the millions of subscribers, hundreds of networks 
providers  and  cloud  providers.  There  are  several 
mobile applications that started to use CC advantages; 
in  this  part  some  typical  examples  are  briefly 
explained.  
  Mobile Commerce  

Mobile  commerce  is  the  ability  to  provide 
commerce  using  a  mobile  device,  such  as  a  mobile 
phone,  a  Personal  Digital  Assistant  (PDA),  a 
Smartphone,  or  other  emerging  mobile  equipment 
such as dashed mobile devices [5]. The m-commerce 
applications  fulfill  many  tasks  that  require  mobility 
functions  like  mobile  transactions  and  payments, 
mobile  messaging,  and  mobile 
ticketing.  Some 
services  and  products  are  mobile  ticketing,  Mobile 
vouchers, coupons and loyalty  cards, Location-based 
services, Mobile banking, Mobile  brokerage, Mobile 
marketing and advertising [5].  

As  the  m-commerce  have  several  products  and 
applications,  there  are  various  challenges  like  low 
network bandwidth, high complexity of mobile device 
configurations,  and  security/privacy.  As  a  result,  m-
commerce  applications  are  navigated  into  cloud 
computing  environment  to  solve  these  problems. 
Some security solutions are based on PKI (public key 
infrastructure).  This  mechanism  uses  an  encryption-
based access to ensure subscribers’ private and secure 
access to the cloud stored data.  

Mobile  Healthcare  Medical  applications  in  the 
mobile  environment  called  as  mobile  healthcare 
applications  and  used  for  medical  treatment,  patient 
tracking,  etc.  The  purpose  of  applying  MCC  in 
medical  applications  is  to  decrease  disadvantages  of 
traditional  medical  applications  like  small  physical 
storage, security and privacy, and medical errors.  

Mobile healthcare provides these facilities:  

  Health  monitoring  services  for  patients  to  be 
monitored  at  anytime  and  anywhere    through 
internet or network provider.  

  Emergency  management  system  for  emergency 
vehicles to reach or manage vehicles effectively 
and  in  time,  in  case  of  receiving  calls  from 
incidents and accidents.

Challenges in MCC  

Mobile  cloud  computing  is  an  technique  or  model  in  which  mobile 
applications  are  built,  powered  and  hosted  using  cloud      computing 
technology.  A  mobile  cloud  approach  enables  developers  to  build 
applications designed specifically for mobile users without being bound 
by the mobile operating system and the computing or memory capacity 
of  the  Smartphone.  Mobile  cloud  computing  centered  are  generally 
accessed  via  a  mobile  browser  from  a  remote  web  server,  typically 
without  the  need  for  installing  a  client  application  on  the  recipient 
phone.    This  concept  is  also  sometimes  referred  to  as  MoClo,  a 
combination  of  Mobile  Cloud.  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (MCC)  has 
revolutionized  the  way  in  which mobile  subscribers  across  the  globe 
leverage  services  on  the  go.  The  mobile  devices  have  evolved  from 
mere devices that enabled voice calls only a few  years back to smart 
devices  that  enable  the  user  to  access  value  added  services  anytime, 
anywhere.  MCC 
the  mobile 
environment  and  overcomes  obstacles  related  to  performance  (as 
battery life, storage, and bandwidth), environment (e.g. heterogeneity, 
scalability, availability) and security (e.g. reliability and privacy).

1.  Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  defined  as  the  trend  in 
which resources are provided to a local client on an 
on-demand basis, usually by means of the internet. 
At    the    same    time,    Cloud    Computing    has  
emerged    as   a   phenomenon  that   represents   the  
way   by  which  IT   services  and functionality are 
charged  for and  delivered.  NIST  (National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology,  USA)  definition  [3] 
from  September,  2011  released  in  its  “Special 
Publication 800-145” of Cloud Computing is: 

“Cloud  Computing  is  a  model  for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared 
pool  of  configurable  resources  (e.g.  networks, 
servers,  storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can 
rapidly  be  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.” 

It can be thought as a combination of the cloud 
computing and mobile environment. The cloud can be 
used for   power and storage, as mobile devices don’t 
have powerful resources compared to traditional

computation devices. Today, there are already lots of 
good  examples  of  MCC  applications  including 
Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  such  applications. 
However,  the  most  of  applications  still  do  most  of 
the  calculation  and  data  storage  on  the  mobile 
devices themselves, not in the cloud. 

The general architecture is as depicted in Fig 1

Delivering 

in 
challenges 

a  mobile 
services 
environment  brings  numerous 
and 
problems. Mobile devices cannot handle complicated 
applications due to their innate characters. Also, it is 
impossible that a mobile device is always online, the 
offline  solution  of  the  device  need  be  considered  as 
well. The absence of standards, security and privacy, 
elastic mobile applications requirement may obstruct 
the  development  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  In 
order to understand the challenges and provide further 
scope  for  research,  an  understanding  of  this  novel 
approach is essential. This paper introduces the basic 
model  of  MCC,  its  background,  key  technology, 
challenges, current research status and future research 
perspectives.  
2.  Background 

a 

From 

simple  viewpoint  mobile 

cloud 
computing can be thought of as infrastructure where 
data  and  processing  could  happen  outside  of  the 
mobile  device,  enabling  new  types  of  applications 
such  as  context-aware  mobile  social  networks.  As  a 
result, many mobile cloud applications are not limited 
to powerful smartphones, but to a broad range of less 
advanced mobile phones and, therefore, to a broader 
subscriber audience. MCC can be simply divided into 
mobile computing and cloud computing. The mobile 
devices can be laptops, PDA, smartphones and so on, 
which connect with a base station or a hotspot by a 
radio link such as 3G, Wi-Fi or GPRS. Although the 
client  is  changed  from  PCs  or  fixed  machines  to 
mobile  devices,  the  main  concept  is  still  cloud 
computing.  Mobile  users  send  service  requests  to  
the    cloud    through    a    web    browser    or    desktop  
application.    The  management  component  of  cloud 
then  allocates  resources  to  the  request  to  establish 
connection,  while  the  monitoring  and  calculating 
functions of mobile cloud computing are implemented 
to ensure the QoS until the connection is completed.

On-demand 
can 
unilaterally stipulation computing capabilities, such as 
server 
time  and  network  storage,  as  needed 
automatically  without  requiring  human  interaction 
with each service provider. 
Broad  network  access:  Capabilities  are  available 
over  the  network  and  accessed  through  standard 
mechanisms that promote use  by heterogeneous thin 

service:  A 

consumer 

self 

 

 

ICARI 

or thick client platforms like mobile phones, laptops, 
PDAs etc. 
Resource  pooling:  The  provider’s  computing 
resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple  consumers 
using  a  multi-tenant  model,  with  different  physical 
and  virtual  resources  dynamically  assigned  and 
reassigned  according  to  consumer  demand.  The 
customer does not have control or knowledge over the 
exact location of the provided resources. Examples of 
resources 
include  storage,  processing,  memory, 
network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid  elasticity:  Capabilities  can  be  rapidly  and 
elastically  provisioned,  in  some  cases  automatically, 
to  quickly  scale  out  and  rapidly  released  to  quickly 
scale in. 
Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  and  optimize  resource  use  by  leveraging  a 
metering  capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction 
appropriate  to  the  type  of  service  (e.g.  storage, 
processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). 
2.2 Service Models 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  The  capability 
provided  to  the  consumer  is  to  use  the  provider’s 
applications  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 
applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a web bro wser 
(e.g.,  web-based  email).  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
with  the  possible  exception  of  limited  user-specific 
application configuration settings. 
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure 
acquired 
applications  created  using  programming  languages 
and  tools  supported  by  the  provider.  The  consumer 
does  not  manage  or  control  the  underlying  cloud 
infrastructure  including  network,  servers,  operating 
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications 
application  hosting 
environment configurations. 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to provision processing, 
storage, networks, and  other  fundamental  computing 
resources  where  the  consumer is  able  to  deploy  and 
run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating 
systems  and  applications.  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
but  has  control  over  operating  systems;  storage, 
deployed applications, and possibly limited control of 
select networking components (e.g. host firewalls).

3.  Architecture 

An overview of basic Mobile Cloud Computing 
was  presented  in  the  previous  section.  A  general 
architecture in a broader sense was as depicted in Fig 
1. A more detailed representation will be presented in 
this  section.  Fig  4  presents  a  typical  Mobile  Cloud 
Computing architecture [8].

2.3 Operation Models 
Private  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  operated 
solely for an organization. It may be managed by the 
organization or a third party and may exist on premise 
or off premise. 
Community  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is 
shared  by  several  organizations  and  supports  a 
specific  community  that  has  shared  concerns  (e.g., 
mission, 
and 
compliance  considerations).  It  may  be  managed  by 
the organization s or a third party and may  exist on 
premise or off premise. 
Public  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  or  a  large  industry 
group and is owned by an organization selling cloud 
services. 
Hybrid  Cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
composition  of 
(private, 
community, or public) that remain unique entities but 
are  bound  together  by  standardized  or  proprietary 
technology that enables data and application portabilit 
y  (e.g.,  cloud  bursting  for  load-balancing  between 
clouds).

Fig: 4. Mobile Cloud Computing Architecture 
The  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  architecture  is 
basically shown in the Figure. The main architecture 
is  composed  from  the  components:  mobile  users, 
mobile  operators,  internet  service  providers  (ISP), 
cloud service providers, respectively [3].  

network 

provider 

Mobile  devices  generally  mobile  phones 
communicate with the mobile networks with the help 
of  base  stations,  access  points  and/or  satellite.  The 
information sent from the mobile devices are operated 
on the central processors, servers and database on the 
mobile 
side.  The  main 
communication is composed from both stakeholders. 
Generally,  the  mobile  network  provider  is  like  a 
middleware with SOAP or RESTful WS services and 
delivers  the  service  result  taken  from  the  cloud 
providers to the mobile client. There are also different 
applications  of  MCC  by  using  the  cloud  services 
without using network provider, directly through the 
internet [3]. The mobile network operator delivers the 
mobile  clients’  requests  to  the  cloud  through  the 
internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

WLAN.  As  a  result,  handling  like  heterogeneous 
network  connectivity  becomes  very  hard  while 
satisfying mobile cloud computing requirements such 
as  connectivity  which  is  always  on,  on-demand 
scalable  connectivity,  and  the  energy  efficiency  of 
mobile  devices.  This  problem  can  be  solved  10  by 
using standardized interfaces and messaging protocols 
to reach, manage and distribute contents.  
Pricing:  Using  multiple  services  in  mobile  requires 
with both mobile network provider and cloud service 
provider.  However,  these  providers  have  different 
methods of payment and prices for services, features 
and facilities. Therefore, this has possibility of leading 
to many problems like how to determine price, how 
the  price  could  be  shared  among  the  providers  or 
parties,  and  how  the  subscribers  can  pay.  As  an 
example, when a mobile user wants to run a not free 
mobile application on the cloud, this participates three 
stakeholders as one of them is application provider for 
application  licence,  second  one  is  mobile  network 
provider  for  used  data  communication  from  user  to 
cloud,  and third  one  is  cloud  provider  for  providing 
and running application on the cloud.  
Computing Side Challenges  

In  the  cloud  side,  main  obstacles  and  solutions 

are listed below:  
Computing  Offloading:  As  mentioned  previous 
parts, offloading is one of the key features of MCC to 
improve  the  battery  life  time  and  to  increase  the 
applications’  performance  by  using  the  cloud 
. 
Although this solution is very useful in the means of 
process  power  and  storage,  it  can  be  ineffective  in 
some situations. For example, the mobile devices can 
consume more energy for an application by using the 
cloud  rather  than  local  processing.  For  a  critical 
threshold,  using  the  mobile  device  instead  of  cloud 
might be more effective.  Therefore, a problem arises 
that  the  optimum  way  of  trade-off  between  the 
communication  and  calculation  costs  have  to  be 
estimated  or  calculated  for  mobile  applications. The 
communication  cost  mainly  depends  on  the  size  of 
transmitted data and the bandwidth of network, while 
the computation cost can be defined by the means of 
computation time. The optimal decisions of a program 
partitioning can be made at a runtime dynamically, by 
using and operating cost algorithms.  

As an example, an approach for deciding which 
components of Java programs should be offloaded can 
be given. In this approach, a Java program is divided 
into methods and uses several parameters like size of 
methods  or  line  of  codes  to  calculate  execution  11 
costs 
this  approach 
compares  the  local  execution  costs  of  each  method 

these  methods.  Then,

In  Mobile 

4.  Challenges 
Computing 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  Mobile 
Cloud  Computing  has  many  benefits  and  good 
application  examples  for  mobile  users  and  service 
providers. On the other hand, as mentioned in some 
parts, there are also some challenges related to cloud 
computing and mobile networks communication. This 
section gives some explanation about these obstacles 
and solutions.  
Mobile Side Challenges  

In  the  mobile  network  side,  main  obstacles  and 

solutions are listed below:  
Low Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the one of important 
issues  in  mobile  cloud  environment  because  mobile 
network resource is much smaller compared with the 
traditional networks. Therefore, P2P Media Streaming 
for  sharing  limited  bandwidth among  the  users  who 
are  located  nearby  in  the  same  area  for  the  same 
content such as the same video. By this method, each 
user transmits or exchanges parts of the same content 
with the other users, which is resulted in improvement 
of content quality, especially for videos.  
Availability: Network failures, out of signal errors, or 
high  traffic  related  poor  performance  problems  are 
main threats to prevent users to connect to the cloud. 
But there are some solutions to help mobile users in 
the case of any disconnection from the clouds. One of 
them  is  Wi-Fi  Based  Multihop  MANET.  It  is  a 
distributed  content  sharing  protocol  for  the  situation 
without any infrastructure. In this mechanism, nearby 
nodes  are  detected  in  case  of  the  failure  of  direct 
connection to the cloud. In this case, instead of having 
a link directly to the cloud, mobile user can connect to 
the cloud through neighboring nodes. Although there 
are  some  considers  about  security  issues  for  such 
mechanisms, these issues can also be solved.  
Heterogeneity:  There  are  types  of  networks  which 
are used simultaneously in mobile environment such 
as  WCDMA,  GPRS,  WiMAX,  CDMA2000,  and

with  the  remote  (cloud)  execution  costs  to  make  an 
optimal execution decision.  
Security:  Trust is the main issue of the subscribers in 
the  mobile  platform.  When  it  comes  to  MCC,  this 
issiue  gains  more  importance  as  the  stakeholders 
increase in the cloud environment for protecting user 
privacy  and  data/application  secrecy.  One  of  the 
security issue is mobile device users, other one is the 
data privacy and security.  As mobile users, there are 
several  security  threats  like  malicious  codes  like 
virus, worm, and Trojan horses and privacy concerns 
when thinking of integrated global positioning system 
(GPS) devices that can lead subscribers to be tracked. 
To overcome this issue, there is security programmes 
can  be  runned  on  mobile  devices  to  prevent  illegal 
threats, but these programs use big portion of mobile 
device  resources  while  running.  Therefore  there  is 
some  approaches  moves  threat  detection  capabilities 
from  mobile  devices  to  cloud.  For  example,  Cloud 
AV  platform  provides  a  multiple  service  based  on 
both cloud and mobile device for malware detection . 
A simple and lightweight part of the application runs 
on  the  mobile  device  and  it  communicates  with  the 
major  component  of  the  application  in  the  cloud. 
Detection capabilities are moved to the cloud, as the 
mobile  agent  application  sends  file  parts  in  the 
background to the cloud server application 
Authentication:  Although 
application 
developers and mobile users benefit from storing and 
processing  a  large  amount  of  data/applications  on  a 
cloud, they should be careful of dealing with the data 
or applications in terms of rights and authentication. 
Users have tendency of using small passwords while 
accessing external resources, so there is need for more 
secure authentication mechanisms. As an example of 
authentication method, TrustCube can be given. It is a 
policy  based  cloud  authentication  mechanism  using 
open  standards  and  it  integrates  various  types  of 
authentication.  
Data Access: While cloud services are increasing, the 
number  of  data  resources  on  the  cloud  rapidly 
increases.  Therefore,  dealing  with 
these  data 
resources  in  the  means  of  storing,  managing  or 
accessing  becomes  very  challenging.  Cloud  storage 
providers 
input-output 
operations executes jobs generally, in file level which 
increases 
the  cost  of  data  communication  and 
processing  for  mobile  clients.  There  are  some 
solutions  that  providing  an  efficient  and  less  costly 
way of block level based I/O algorithms instead of file 
level.  In  this  solution,  not  all  the  file  transmitted, 
instead  data  blocks  are  transmitted,  in  case  of 
necessity, which is very useful by the means of time 
and network  communication  cost.  13  In  addition,  to 

like  Amazon  S3,  every

increase  data  access  efficiency,  mobile  devices  can 
use local storage as cache for specific parts of cloud 
service to increase access speed and reduce network 
necessity. Here, there is also a problem, as we cannot 
store large data on the mobile device storage cache, so 
some data management or data selections mechanisms 
have to be applied to determine which parts or amount 
of data can be cached or used from cloud. There are 
several  other  issues  related  to  implementation  of 
MCC. A few of them have been listed below: 
4.1 Absence of standards 

the 

over 

conventional 

Inspite  of  the  various  advantages  of  Cloud 
computing 
computing 
techniques,  there  is  no  accepted  open  standard 
available.  Portability  and  interoperability  is  also 
impossible  between  different  cloud  computing 
Service  Providers  (CCSP). This  prevents  the  service 
providers to widely deploy and quickly develop Cloud 
computing. Customers are reluctant to transform their 
current  datacenters  and  IT  resources 
to  cloud 
platforms  owing  to  a  number  of  unsolved  technical 
problems  that  exist  in  these  platforms.  Some  of  the 
problems existing due to a lack of open standards are 
the following: 
  Limited scalability: Owing to the rapid growth, 
none of the CCSPs can meet all the requirements 
of all the users. 

  Unreliable 

availability 

service: 
Dependence  on  a  single  CCSP’s  service  can 
result in a bottleneck in the event of a breakdown 
of a service. 

of 

a 

  Service provider lock-in: Absence of portability 
makes  it  impossible  for  data  and  application 
transfer among CCSPs, consequently customer is 
locked to a CCSP. 

  Unable to deploy service over multiple CCSPs: 
Absence  of  interoperability  makes  it  impossible 
for application to be scaled over multiple CCSPs. 
In  view  of  the  afore  mentioned  disadvantages, 
B.Rochwerger et al. have introduced a solution called 
Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation  (OCCF)  in  [21], 
that  solves  the  problems  of  interoperability  and 
portability among various CCSPs. However, the move 
to  a  common  cloud  standard  is  impossible  because 
most  of  the  cloud  computing  firms  have  their  own 
APIs and for setting those up lots of funds were spent.

mechanism. A possible approach is to have a Mobile 
Agent  Based  Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation 
(MABOCCF) mechanism as introduced by Chetan S. 
et al. in [22].

4.2 Access Schemes 

MCC  will  be  deployed  in  a  heterogeneous 
access  scenario  in  terms  of  Wireless  Network 
Interfaces.  Mobile  nodes  access  the  Cloud  through 
different  radio  access 
technologies  viz.  GPRS, 
WLAN, LTE, WiMAX, CDMA2000, WCDMA etc. 
Mobile  Cloud  Computing  requires  the  following 
features: 
  MCC requires an “always-on” connectivity for a 

low data rate cloud control signaling channel 

  MCC requires an “on-demand” available wireless 

connectivity with a scalable link bandwidth 

  MCC  requires  a  network  selection  and  use  that 

takes energy-efficiency and costs into account 
Access management is a critical aspect of MCC. 
A  possible  solution  is  to  use  context  and  location 
information to optimize mobile access, as proposed 
by  A.Klein et al. in [23]. Deploying MCC utilizing 
the context information, such as device locations and 
capabilities  and  user  profiles,  can  be  used  by  the 
mobile  cloud  server  to  locally  optimize  the  access 
management. 
4.3 Security 

Mobile devices today have all the functionalities 
of  a  standard  computer.  This,  like  for  the  standards 
computers,  poses  a  security  threat  to  the  mobile 
devices as well. The threat detection services run on 
the  mobile  devices  to  combat  these  security  threats, 
warrant intensive usage of resources, both in terms of 
computation  and  power.  A  possible  solution  is  to 
move  these  detection  services  to  the  cloud.  It  saves 
the  device  CPU  and  memory  requirements  with 
increased  bandwidth  as  the  price  to  be  paid.  This 
approach has the following benefits: 
  Better detection of malicious software 
  Reduced on-device resource consumption 
  Reduced on-device software complexity 
4.4 Elastic Application Models 

for  peak 

Cloud  computing  services  are  scalable,  via 
dynamic provisioning of resources on a fine grained, 
self-service basis near real-time, without users having 
to  engineer 
loads.  This  requirement 
particularly  manifests  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing 
due to the intrinsic limitations of mobile devices. For 
example,  the  iPhone  4s  is  equipped  with  800  MHz 
CPU, 512 MB RAM allowing about 8 hrs of talktime 
and 14.4 Mbps speed  on HSDPA 4G network, [24]. 
Compared to today’s  PC and server platforms, these

5.  Applications  Of  Mobile  Cloud 

Computing 
Mobile  applications  have  been  used  widely  and 
have a huge share in a global mobile market, because 
of the millions of subscribers, hundreds of networks 
providers  and  cloud  providers.  There  are  several 
mobile applications that started to use CC advantages; 
in  this  part  some  typical  examples  are  briefly 
explained.  
  Mobile Commerce  

Mobile  commerce  is  the  ability  to  provide 
commerce  using  a  mobile  device,  such  as  a  mobile 
phone,  a  Personal  Digital  Assistant  (PDA),  a 
Smartphone,  or  other  emerging  mobile  equipment 
such as dashed mobile devices [5]. The m-commerce 
applications  fulfill  many  tasks  that  require  mobility 
functions  like  mobile  transactions  and  payments, 
mobile  messaging,  and  mobile 
ticketing.  Some 
services  and  products  are  mobile  ticketing,  Mobile 
vouchers, coupons and loyalty  cards, Location-based 
services, Mobile banking, Mobile  brokerage, Mobile 
marketing and advertising [5].  

As  the  m-commerce  have  several  products  and 
applications,  there  are  various  challenges  like  low 
network bandwidth, high complexity of mobile device 
configurations,  and  security/privacy.  As  a  result,  m-
commerce  applications  are  navigated  into  cloud 
computing  environment  to  solve  these  problems. 
Some security solutions are based on PKI (public key 
infrastructure).  This  mechanism  uses  an  encryption-
based access to ensure subscribers’ private and secure 
access to the cloud stored data.  

Mobile  Healthcare  Medical  applications  in  the 
mobile  environment  called  as  mobile  healthcare 
applications  and  used  for  medical  treatment,  patient 
tracking,  etc.  The  purpose  of  applying  MCC  in 
medical  applications  is  to  decrease  disadvantages  of 
traditional  medical  applications  like  small  physical 
storage, security and privacy, and medical errors.  

Mobile healthcare provides these facilities:  

  Health  monitoring  services  for  patients  to  be 
monitored  at  anytime  and  anywhere    through 
internet or network provider.  

  Emergency  management  system  for  emergency 
vehicles to reach or manage vehicles effectively 
and  in  time,  in  case  of  receiving  calls  from 
incidents and accidents.  

 257

  Healthcare  mobile  devices  for  detecting  pulse-
rate,  blood  pressure,  and 
level  of  alcohol 
integrated  with  a  system  to  alert  in  case  of 
emergency.  

  Store healthcare information of patients to use in 

medical experiments or researches.  
Mobile  healthcare  applications  provide  users 
easiness and quickness by accessing resources at any 
time,  from  anywhere.  By  the  help  of  cloud,  mobile 
healthcare applications  offer a  variety  of  on-demand 
services on clouds rather than standalone applications 
on local computers and servers. However, there have 
to be proposed solutions to protect participant’s health 
information  to  increase  the  privacy  of  the  users,  as 
have to be done in the traditional applications.  
  Mobile Learning  

learning 

(e-learning) 

Mobile  learning  is  learning  across  contexts  and 
learning  with mobile  devices.  Its  design  is  based  on 
electronic 
and  mobility. 
Traditional  m-learning  applications  have  limitations 
because  of  high  cost  of  devices  and  network,  low 
network  transmission  rate,  and  limited  educational 
resources.  Cloud-based  (mobile  learning) m-learning 
applications  are  introduced  to  solve  these  problems. 
As an example, with the help of powerful processing 
large  storage  capacity, 
ability  and  cloud’s 
the 
applications  provide 
learners  with  much  richer 
services  in  terms  of  data  (information)  size,  faster 
processing speed, and longer battery life.

Challenges in MCC  

Mobile  cloud  computing  is  an  technique  or  model  in  which  mobile 
applications  are  built,  powered  and  hosted  using  cloud      computing 
technology.  A  mobile  cloud  approach  enables  developers  to  build 
applications designed specifically for mobile users without being bound 
by the mobile operating system and the computing or memory capacity 
of  the  Smartphone.  Mobile  cloud  computing  centered  are  generally 
accessed  via  a  mobile  browser  from  a  remote  web  server,  typically 
without  the  need  for  installing  a  client  application  on  the  recipient 
phone.    This  concept  is  also  sometimes  referred  to  as  MoClo,  a 
combination  of  Mobile  Cloud.  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (MCC)  has 
revolutionized  the  way  in  which mobile  subscribers  across  the  globe 
leverage  services  on  the  go.  The  mobile  devices  have  evolved  from 
mere devices that enabled voice calls only a few  years back to smart 
devices  that  enable  the  user  to  access  value  added  services  anytime, 
anywhere.  MCC

environment  and  overcomes  obstacles  related  to  performance  (as 
battery life, storage, and bandwidth), environment (e.g. heterogeneity, 
scalability, availability) and security (e.g. reliability and privacy).

1.  Introduction 

Cloud  computing  is  defined  as  the  trend  in 
which resources are provided to a local client on an 
on-demand basis, usually by means of the internet. 
At    the    same    time,    Cloud    Computing    has  
emerged    as   a   phenomenon  that   represents   the  
way   by  which  IT   services  and functionality are 
charged  for and  delivered.  NIST  (National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology,  USA)  definition  [3] 
from  September,  2011  released  in  its  “Special 
Publication 800-145” of Cloud Computing is: 

“Cloud  Computing  is  a  model  for  enabling 
convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared 
pool  of  configurable  resources  (e.g.  networks, 
servers,  storage,  applications  and  services)  that  can 
rapidly  be  provisioned  and  released  with  minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.” 

It can be thought as a combination of the cloud 
computing and mobile environment. The cloud can be 
used for   power and storage, as mobile devices don’t 
have powerful resources compared to traditional

computation devices. Today, there are already lots of 
good  examples  of  MCC  applications  including 
Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  such  applications. 
However,  the  most  of  applications  still  do  most  of 
the  calculation  and  data  storage  on  the  mobile 
devices themselves, not in the cloud.

Delivering 

in 
challenges 

a  mobile 
services 
environment  brings  numerous 
and 
problems. Mobile devices cannot handle complicated 
applications due to their innate characters. Also, it is 
impossible that a mobile device is always online, the 
offline  solution  of  the  device  need  be  considered  as 
well. The absence of standards, security and privacy, 
elastic mobile applications requirement may obstruct 
the  development  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  In 
order to understand the challenges and provide further 
scope  for  research,  an  understanding  of  this  novel 
approach is essential. This paper introduces the basic 
model  of  MCC,  its  background,  key  technology, 
challenges, current research status and future research 
perspectives.  
2.  Background 

a 

From 

simple  viewpoint  mobile 

cloud 
computing can be thought of as infrastructure where 
data  and  processing  could  happen  outside  of  the 
mobile  device,  enabling  new  types  of  applications 
such  as  context-aware  mobile  social  networks.  As  a 
result, many mobile cloud applications are not limited 
to powerful smartphones, but to a broad range of less 
advanced mobile phones and, therefore, to a broader 
subscriber audience. MCC can be simply divided into 
mobile computing and cloud computing. The mobile 
devices can be laptops, PDA, smartphones and so on, 
which connect with a base station or a hotspot by a 
radio link such as 3G, Wi-Fi or GPRS. Although the 
client  is  changed  from  PCs  or  fixed  machines  to 
mobile  devices,  the  main  concept  is  still  cloud 
computing.  Mobile  users  send  service  requests  to  
the    cloud    through    a    web    browser    or    desktop  
application.    The  management  component  of  cloud 
then  allocates  resources  to  the  request  to  establish 
connection,  while  the  monitoring  and  calculating 
functions of mobile cloud computing are implemented 
to ensure the QoS until the connection is completed. 

three  service  models  and 

The  cloud  model  as  defined  by  NIST  promotes 
is  composed  of  five  essential

availability  and 
characteristics, 
deployment models. 
2.1 Essential distinctiveness 
On-demand 
can 
unilaterally stipulation computing capabilities, such as 
server 
time  and  network  storage,  as  needed 
automatically  without  requiring  human  interaction 
with each service provider. 
Broad  network  access:  Capabilities  are  available 
over  the  network  and  accessed  through  standard 
mechanisms that promote use  by heterogeneous thin 

service:  A 

consumer 

self 

 

 

ICARI 

or thick client platforms like mobile phones, laptops, 
PDAs etc. 
Resource  pooling:  The  provider’s  computing 
resources  are  pooled  to  serve  multiple  consumers 
using  a  multi-tenant  model,  with  different  physical 
and  virtual  resources  dynamically  assigned  and 
reassigned  according  to  consumer  demand.  The 
customer does not have control or knowledge over the 
exact location of the provided resources. Examples of 
resources 
include  storage,  processing,  memory, 
network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid  elasticity:  Capabilities  can  be  rapidly  and 
elastically  provisioned,  in  some  cases  automatically, 
to  quickly  scale  out  and  rapidly  released  to  quickly 
scale in. 
Measured  Service:  Cloud  systems  automatically 
control  and  optimize  resource  use  by  leveraging  a 
metering  capability  at  some  level  of  abstraction 
appropriate  to  the  type  of  service  (e.g.  storage, 
processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). 
2.2 Service Models 
Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  The  capability 
provided  to  the  consumer  is  to  use  the  provider’s 
applications  running  on  a  cloud  infrastructure.  The 
applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a web bro wser 
(e.g.,  web-based  email).  The  consumer  does  not 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
with  the  possible  exception  of  limited  user-specific 
application configuration settings. 
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure 
acquired 
applications  created  using  programming  languages 
and  tools  supported  by  the  provider.  The  consumer 
does  not  manage  or  control  the  underlying  cloud 
infrastructure  including  network,  servers,  operating 
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications 
application  hosting 
environment configurations. 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS):  The  capability 
provided to the consumer is to provision processing, 
storage, networks, and  other  fundamental  computing 
resources  where  the  consumer is  able  to  deploy  and 
run  arbitrary  software,  which  can  include  operating

3.  Architecture 

An overview of basic Mobile Cloud Computing 
was  presented  in  the  previous  section.  A  general 
architecture in a broader sense was as depicted in Fig 
1. A more detailed representation will be presented in 
this  section.  Fig  4  presents  a  typical  Mobile  Cloud 
Computing architecture [8].

2.3 Operation Models 
Private  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  operated 
solely for an organization. It may be managed by the 
organization or a third party and may exist on premise 
or off premise. 
Community  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is 
shared  by  several  organizations  and  supports  a 
specific  community  that  has  shared  concerns  (e.g., 
mission, 
and 
compliance  considerations).  It  may  be  managed  by 
the organization s or a third party and may  exist on 
premise or off premise. 
Public  Cloud:  The  cloud  infrastructure  is  made 
available  to  the  general  public  or  a  large  industry 
group and is owned by an organization selling cloud 
services. 
Hybrid  Cloud:  The  cloud 
is  a 
composition  of 
(private, 
community, or public) that remain unique entities but 
are  bound  together  by  standardized  or  proprietary 
technology that enables data and application portabilit 
y  (e.g.,  cloud  bursting  for  load-balancing  between 
clouds).

Fig: 4. Mobile Cloud Computing Architecture 
The  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  architecture  is 
basically shown in the Figure. The main architecture 
is  composed  from  the  components:  mobile  users, 
mobile  operators,  internet  service  providers  (ISP), 
cloud service providers, respectively [3].  

network 

provider 

Mobile  devices  generally  mobile  phones 
communicate with the mobile networks with the help 
of  base  stations,  access  points  and/or  satellite.  The 
information sent from the mobile devices are operated 
on the central processors, servers and database on the 
mobile 
side.  The  main 
communication is composed from both stakeholders. 
Generally,  the  mobile  network  provider  is  like  a 
middleware with SOAP or RESTful WS services and 
delivers  the  service  result  taken  from  the  cloud 
providers to the mobile client. There are also different 
applications  of  MCC  by  using  the  cloud  services 
without using network provider, directly through the 
internet [3]. The mobile network operator delivers the 
mobile  clients’  requests  to  the  cloud  through  the 
internet.  In  the  cloud,  cloud  controllers  process  the 
requests  to  navigate  to  corresponding  cloud  services 
to  provide  mobile  users.  The  architecture  provides 
effectiveness  by  using  the  advantages  of  the  cloud 
computing. We focus on a layered architecture which 
commonly  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  Cloud 
Computing  model  in  terms  of  user’s  requirements. 
The service model has been explained earlier in this 
section. Fig 5 below gives an overview of the layered 
architecture or cloud stack and who uses these.

WLAN.  As  a  result,  handling  like  heterogeneous 
network  connectivity  becomes  very  hard  while 
satisfying mobile cloud computing requirements such 
as  connectivity  which  is  always  on,  on-demand 
scalable  connectivity,  and  the  energy  efficiency  of 
mobile  devices.  This  problem  can  be  solved  10  by 
using standardized interfaces and messaging protocols 
to reach, manage and distribute contents.  
Pricing:  Using  multiple  services  in  mobile  requires 
with both mobile network provider and cloud service 
provider.  However,  these  providers  have  different 
methods of payment and prices for services, features 
and facilities. Therefore, this has possibility of leading 
to many problems like how to determine price, how 
the  price  could  be  shared  among  the  providers  or 
parties,  and  how  the  subscribers  can  pay.  As  an 
example, when a mobile user wants to run a not free 
mobile application on the cloud, this participates three 
stakeholders as one of them is application provider for 
application  licence,  second  one  is  mobile  network 
provider  for  used  data  communication  from  user  to 
cloud,  and third  one  is  cloud  provider  for  providing 
and running application on the cloud.  
Computing Side Challenges  

In  the  cloud  side,  main  obstacles  and  solutions 

are listed below:  
Computing  Offloading:  As  mentioned  previous 
parts, offloading is one of the key features of MCC to 
improve  the  battery  life  time  and  to  increase  the 
applications’  performance  by  using  the  cloud 
. 
Although this solution is very useful in the means of 
process  power  and  storage,  it  can  be  ineffective  in 
some situations. For example, the mobile devices can 
consume more energy for an application by using the 
cloud  rather  than  local  processing.  For  a  critical 
threshold,  using  the  mobile  device  instead  of  cloud 
might be more effective.  Therefore, a problem arises 
that  the  optimum  way  of  trade-off  between  the 
communication  and  calculation  costs  have  to  be 
estimated  or  calculated  for  mobile  applications. The 
communication  cost  mainly  depends  on  the  size  of 
transmitted data and the bandwidth of network, while 
the computation cost can be defined by the means of 
computation time. The optimal decisions of a program 
partitioning can be made at a runtime dynamically, by 
using and operating cost algorithms.  

As an example, an approach for deciding which 
components of Java programs should be offloaded can 
be given. In this approach, a Java program is divided 
into methods and uses several parameters like size of 
methods  or  line  of  codes  to  calculate  execution  11 
costs 
this  approach 
compares  the  local  execution  costs  of  each  method 

these  methods.  Then,

4.  Challenges 
Computing 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  Mobile 
Cloud  Computing  has  many  benefits  and  good 
application  examples  for  mobile  users  and  service 
providers. On the other hand, as mentioned in some 
parts, there are also some challenges related to cloud 
computing and mobile networks communication. This 
section gives some explanation about these obstacles 
and solutions.  
Mobile Side Challenges  

In  the  mobile  network  side,  main  obstacles  and 

solutions are listed below:  
Low Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the one of important 
issues  in  mobile  cloud  environment  because  mobile 
network resource is much smaller compared with the 
traditional networks. Therefore, P2P Media Streaming 
for  sharing  limited  bandwidth among  the  users  who 
are  located  nearby  in  the  same  area  for  the  same 
content such as the same video. By this method, each 
user transmits or exchanges parts of the same content 
with the other users, which is resulted in improvement 
of content quality, especially for videos.  
Availability: Network failures, out of signal errors, or 
high  traffic  related  poor  performance  problems  are 
main threats to prevent users to connect to the cloud. 
But there are some solutions to help mobile users in 
the case of any disconnection from the clouds. One of 
them  is  Wi-Fi  Based  Multihop  MANET.  It  is  a 
distributed  content  sharing  protocol  for  the  situation 
without any infrastructure. In this mechanism, nearby 
nodes  are  detected  in  case  of  the  failure  of  direct 
connection to the cloud. In this case, instead of having 
a link directly to the cloud, mobile user can connect to 
the cloud through neighboring nodes. Although there 
are  some  considers  about  security  issues  for  such 
mechanisms, these issues can also be solved.  
Heterogeneity:  There  are  types  of  networks  which 
are used simultaneously in mobile environment such 
as  WCDMA,  GPRS,  WiMAX,  CDMA2000,  and 

ICARI

with  the  remote  (cloud)  execution  costs  to  make  an 
optimal execution decision.  
Security:  Trust is the main issue of the subscribers in 
the  mobile  platform.  When  it  comes  to  MCC,  this 
issiue  gains  more  importance  as  the  stakeholders 
increase in the cloud environment for protecting user 
privacy  and  data/application  secrecy.  One  of  the 
security issue is mobile device users, other one is the 
data privacy and security.  As mobile users, there are 
several  security  threats  like  malicious  codes  like 
virus, worm, and Trojan horses and privacy concerns 
when thinking of integrated global positioning system 
(GPS) devices that can lead subscribers to be tracked. 
To overcome this issue, there is security programmes 
can  be  runned  on  mobile  devices  to  prevent  illegal 
threats, but these programs use big portion of mobile 
device  resources  while  running.  Therefore  there  is 
some  approaches  moves  threat  detection  capabilities 
from  mobile  devices  to  cloud.  For  example,  Cloud 
AV  platform  provides  a  multiple  service  based  on 
both cloud and mobile device for malware detection . 
A simple and lightweight part of the application runs 
on  the  mobile  device  and  it  communicates  with  the 
major  component  of  the  application  in  the  cloud. 
Detection capabilities are moved to the cloud, as the 
mobile  agent  application  sends  file  parts  in  the 
background to the cloud server application 
Authentication:  Although 
application 
developers and mobile users benefit from storing and 
processing  a  large  amount  of  data/applications  on  a 
cloud, they should be careful of dealing with the data 
or applications in terms of rights and authentication. 
Users have tendency of using small passwords while 
accessing external resources, so there is need for more 
secure authentication mechanisms. As an example of 
authentication method, TrustCube can be given. It is a 
policy  based  cloud  authentication  mechanism  using 
open  standards  and  it  integrates  various  types  of 
authentication.  
Data Access: While cloud services are increasing, the 
number  of  data  resources  on  the  cloud  rapidly 
increases.  Therefore,  dealing  with 
these  data 
resources  in  the  means  of  storing,  managing  or 
accessing  becomes  very  challenging.  Cloud  storage 
providers 
input-output 
operations executes jobs generally, in file level which 
increases 
the  cost  of  data  communication  and 
processing  for  mobile  clients.  There  are  some 
solutions  that  providing  an  efficient  and  less  costly 
way of block level based I/O algorithms instead of file 
level.  In  this  solution,  not  all  the  file  transmitted, 
instead  data  blocks  are  transmitted,  in  case  of 
necessity, which is very useful by the means of time 
and network  communication  cost.  13  In  addition,  to 

like  Amazon  S3,  every

increase  data  access  efficiency,  mobile  devices  can 
use local storage as cache for specific parts of cloud 
service to increase access speed and reduce network 
necessity. Here, there is also a problem, as we cannot 
store large data on the mobile device storage cache, so 
some data management or data selections mechanisms 
have to be applied to determine which parts or amount 
of data can be cached or used from cloud. There are 
several  other  issues  related  to  implementation  of 
MCC. A few of them have been listed below: 
4.1 Absence of standards 

the 

over 

conventional 

Inspite  of  the  various  advantages  of  Cloud 
computing 
computing 
techniques,  there  is  no  accepted  open  standard 
available.  Portability  and  interoperability  is  also 
impossible  between  different  cloud  computing 
Service  Providers  (CCSP). This  prevents  the  service 
providers to widely deploy and quickly develop Cloud 
computing. Customers are reluctant to transform their 
current  datacenters  and  IT  resources 
to  cloud 
platforms  owing  to  a  number  of  unsolved  technical 
problems  that  exist  in  these  platforms.  Some  of  the 
problems existing due to a lack of open standards are 
the following: 
  Limited scalability: Owing to the rapid growth, 
none of the CCSPs can meet all the requirements 
of all the users. 

  Unreliable 

availability 

service: 
Dependence  on  a  single  CCSP’s  service  can 
result in a bottleneck in the event of a breakdown 
of a service. 

of 

a 

  Service provider lock-in: Absence of portability 
makes  it  impossible  for  data  and  application 
transfer among CCSPs, consequently customer is 
locked to a CCSP. 

  Unable to deploy service over multiple CCSPs: 
Absence  of  interoperability  makes  it  impossible 
for application to be scaled over multiple CCSPs. 
In  view  of  the  afore  mentioned  disadvantages, 
B.Rochwerger et al. have introduced a solution called 
Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation  (OCCF)  in  [21], 
that  solves  the  problems  of  interoperability  and 
portability among various CCSPs. However, the move 
to  a  common  cloud  standard  is  impossible  because 
most  of  the  cloud  computing  firms  have  their  own 
APIs and for setting those up lots of funds were spent. 
The  OCCF

mechanism. A possible approach is to have a Mobile 
Agent  Based  Open  Cloud  Computing  Federation 
(MABOCCF) mechanism as introduced by Chetan S. 
et al. in [22].

4.2 Access Schemes 

MCC  will  be  deployed  in  a  heterogeneous 
access  scenario  in  terms  of  Wireless  Network 
Interfaces.  Mobile  nodes  access  the  Cloud  through 
different  radio  access 
technologies  viz.  GPRS, 
WLAN, LTE, WiMAX, CDMA2000, WCDMA etc. 
Mobile  Cloud  Computing  requires  the  following 
features: 
  MCC requires an “always-on” connectivity for a 

low data rate cloud control signaling channel 

  MCC requires an “on-demand” available wireless 

connectivity with a scalable link bandwidth 

  MCC  requires  a  network  selection  and  use  that 

takes energy-efficiency and costs into account 
Access management is a critical aspect of MCC. 
A  possible  solution  is  to  use  context  and  location 
information to optimize mobile access, as proposed 
by  A.Klein et al. in [23]. Deploying MCC utilizing 
the context information, such as device locations and 
capabilities  and  user  profiles,  can  be  used  by  the 
mobile  cloud  server  to  locally  optimize  the  access 
management. 
4.3 Security 

Mobile devices today have all the functionalities 
of  a  standard  computer.  This,  like  for  the  standards 
computers,  poses  a  security  threat  to  the  mobile 
devices as well. The threat detection services run on 
the  mobile  devices  to  combat  these  security  threats, 
warrant intensive usage of resources, both in terms of 
computation  and  power.  A  possible  solution  is  to 
move  these  detection  services  to  the  cloud.  It  saves 
the  device  CPU  and  memory  requirements  with 
increased  bandwidth  as  the  price  to  be  paid.  This 
approach has the following benefits: 
  Better detection of malicious software 
  Reduced on-device resource consumption 
  Reduced on-device software complexity 
4.4 Elastic Application Models 

for  peak 

Cloud  computing  services  are  scalable,  via 
dynamic provisioning of resources on a fine grained, 
self-service basis near real-time, without users having 
to  engineer 
loads.  This  requirement 
particularly  manifests  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing 
due to the intrinsic limitations of mobile devices. For 
example,  the  iPhone  4s  is  equipped  with  800  MHz 
CPU, 512 MB RAM allowing about 8 hrs of talktime 
and 14.4 Mbps speed  on HSDPA 4G network, [24]. 
Compared to today’s  PC and server platforms, these

5.  Applications  Of  Mobile  Cloud 

Computing 
Mobile  applications  have  been  used  widely  and 
have a huge share in a global mobile market, because 
of the millions of subscribers, hundreds of networks 
providers  and  cloud  providers.  There  are  several 
mobile applications that started to use CC advantages; 
in  this  part  some  typical  examples  are  briefly 
explained.  
  Mobile Commerce  

Mobile  commerce  is  the  ability  to  provide 
commerce  using  a  mobile  device,  such  as  a  mobile 
phone,  a  Personal  Digital  Assistant  (PDA),  a 
Smartphone,  or  other  emerging  mobile  equipment 
such as dashed mobile devices [5]. The m-commerce 
applications  fulfill  many  tasks  that  require  mobility 
functions  like  mobile  transactions  and  payments, 
mobile  messaging,  and  mobile 
ticketing.  Some 
services  and  products  are  mobile  ticketing,  Mobile 
vouchers, coupons and loyalty  cards, Location-based 
services, Mobile banking, Mobile  brokerage, Mobile 
marketing and advertising [5].  

As  the  m-commerce  have  several  products  and 
applications,  there  are  various  challenges  like  low 
network bandwidth, high complexity of mobile device 
configurations,  and  security/privacy.  As  a  result,  m-
commerce  applications  are  navigated  into  cloud 
computing  environment  to  solve  these  problems. 
Some security solutions are based on PKI (public key 
infrastructure).  This  mechanism  uses  an  encryption-
based access to ensure subscribers’ private and secure 
access to the cloud stored data.  

Mobile  Healthcare  Medical  applications  in  the 
mobile  environment  called  as  mobile  healthcare 
applications  and  used  for  medical  treatment,  patient 
tracking,  etc.  The  purpose  of  applying  MCC  in 
medical  applications  is  to  decrease  disadvantages  of 
traditional  medical  applications  like  small  physical 
storage, security and privacy, and medical errors.  

Mobile healthcare provides these facilities:  

  Health  monitoring  services  for  patients  to  be 
monitored  at  anytime  and  anywhere    through 
internet or network provider.  

  Emergency  management  system  for  emergency 
vehicles to reach or manage vehicles effectively 
and  in  time,  in  case  of  receiving  calls  from 
incidents and accidents.  

 257

ISBN 978-93-5156-328-0 

 
  Healthcare  mobile  devices  for  detecting  pulse-
rate,  blood  pressure,  and 
level  of  alcohol 
integrated  with  a  system  to  alert  in  case  of 
emergency.  

  Store healthcare information of patients to use in 

medical experiments or researches.  
Mobile  healthcare  applications  provide  users 
easiness and quickness by accessing resources at any 
time,  from  anywhere.  By  the  help  of  cloud,  mobile 
healthcare applications  offer a  variety  of  on-demand 
services on clouds rather than standalone applications 
on local computers and servers. However, there have 
to be proposed solutions to protect participant’s health 
information  to  increase  the  privacy  of  the  users,  as 
have to be done in the traditional applications.  
  Mobile Learning  

learning 

(e-learning) 

Mobile  learning  is  learning  across  contexts  and 
learning  with mobile  devices.  Its  design  is  based  on 
electronic 
and  mobility. 
Traditional  m-learning  applications  have  limitations 
because  of  high  cost  of  devices  and  network,  low 
network  transmission  rate,  and  limited  educational 
resources.  Cloud-based  (mobile  learning) m-learning 
applications  are  introduced  to  solve  these  problems. 
As an example, with the help of powerful processing 
large  storage  capacity, 
ability  and  cloud’s 
the 
applications  provide 
learners  with  much  richer 
services  in  terms  of  data  (information)  size,  faster 
processing speed, and longer battery life.

rely on a simple play rather than graphics, because of 
the  lack  of  processing power  of  the  mobile  devices.
