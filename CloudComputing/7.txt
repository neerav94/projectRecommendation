      In  the  cloud  domain,  there  is  currently  a  prevalence  of  independent  services  with  minimal  interest  in 
interoperability or consideration of standards. While this is in the process of changing, there is currently no 
sufficient activity in this area to report on. While the original motivation for grid computing originated with 
large  scientific  collaborations,  it  is  now  established  that  the  same  new  technology  and  perspective  on 
distributed  computing  is  applicable  in  many  domains.  The  Networked  European  Software  and  Services 
Initiative- Grid (NESSI-Grid) review considered the impact of grid technology on business IT infrastructure 
[6],  while  several  projects  have  considered  the  application  of  grid  computing  to  eHealth  .The  recent 
popularity  of  cloud  computing  also  demonstrates  the  industry  benefits  of  shared,  distributed  computing 
infrastructure. 
 
3. Differentiating Cloud Computing and Grid Computing 

   Grid computing is a term referring to the combination of computer resources from multiple administrative 
domains  to  reach  a  common  goal.  The  Grid  can  be  thought  of  as  a  distributed  system  with  non-interactive 
workloads  that  involve  a  large  number  of  files.  What  distinguishes  grid  computing  from  conventional  high 
performance  computing  systems  such  as  cluster  computing  is  that  grids  tend  to  be  more  loosely  coupled, 
heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a grid can be dedicated to a specialized application, it 
is  more  common  that  a  single  grid  will  be  used  for  a  variety  of  different  purposes.  Cloud  computing  is 
Internet-based  computing,  whereby  shared  resources,  software,  and  information  are  provided  to  computers 
and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a  adoption of virtualization, 
Service-oriented  architecture  and  utility  computing  which    originated  in  the  private  sector  where 
virtualization  technology  and  large  data  centers  have  been  turned  into  the  foundation  for  products  and 
services to be resold. This section will help clarify the difference between the two. Subsequent sections will 
focus primarily on grid computing, as  cloud computing still lacks any  substantive standards or possibilities 
for  interoperation,  making  any  discussion  around  cloud  computing  and  the  telecommunications  industry 
purely  speculative.  The  grid  concept  has  a  complementary  but  independent  relationship  to  the  concept  of 
cloud computing. The similarities are that both aim to provide access to a large computing (CPU) or storage 
(disk) resource. Current cloud environments only provide direct support for single user or single organization 
access, and current models typically have a high cost to integrate computing, data, or network transfers from 
outside of the cloud. 

         This  model  suits  environments  where  computing  and  data  resource  needs  can  be  isolated  to  a  single 
location and rapid scaling (up or  down) of computing, network, and data availability are important. Pricing 
models  are  variations  on  normalized  CPU-hours,  GB/day  storage,  and  MB  network  I/O,  or  are  based  on  a 
cloud product that can be licensed and used with local physical resources. In contrast, grid computing aims to 
provide  a  standard  set  of  services  and  software  that  enable  the  collaborative  sharing  of  federated  and 
geographically distributed computing and storage resources. It provides a security framework for identifying 
inter-organizational  parties  (both  human  and  electronic),  managing  data  access  and  movement,  and 
utilization of remote computing resources. Cloud computing offers a solution to the problem of organizations 
that need resources (computing, storage, or network bandwidth) either quickly or with a highly dynamic level 
of  demand.  Operating  in  steady  state  at  or  near  full  capacity,  cloud  computing  is  still  more  expensive  than

2. Landscape for Grid, Cloud and NGN Domains 
 
The wide range of organizations involved with one or more of grid, cloud, and NGN technology each have 
their own priorities. Where operational systems have been designed or deployed, this range of priorities has 
resulted in competing architectures and interfaces. Although NGN does not yet exist as an integrated global 
telecommunications platform, there is a coordinated effort to develop the suite of standards to cover a high 
level NGN architecture [3]. In contrast, grid computing offers a few high level conceptual models, typically 
using the hour-glass middleware imagery. This envisages a wide range of high level applications connected 
to  a  wide  range  of  heterogeneous  low  level  resources  via  a  limited  number  of  intermediate  standard 
interfaces.  In  addition,  there  are  a  few  concrete  architectural  models  for  grid  infrastructures  [4,5].  These 
concrete  models  have  a  distinct  disconnection:  either  they  present  an    architecture  which  is  not  or  only

popularity  of  cloud  computing  also  demonstrates  the  industry  benefits  of  shared,  distributed  computing 
infrastructure. 
 
3. Differentiating Cloud Computing and Grid Computing 

   Grid computing is a term referring to the combination of computer resources from multiple administrative 
domains  to  reach  a  common  goal.  The  Grid  can  be  thought  of  as  a  distributed  system  with  non-interactive 
workloads  that  involve  a  large  number  of  files.  What  distinguishes  grid  computing  from  conventional  high 
performance  computing  systems  such  as  cluster  computing  is  that  grids  tend  to  be  more  loosely  coupled, 
heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a grid can be dedicated to a specialized application, it 
is  more  common  that  a  single  grid  will  be  used  for  a  variety  of  different  purposes.  Cloud  computing  is 
Internet-based  computing,  whereby  shared  resources,  software,  and  information  are  provided  to  computers 
and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a  adoption of virtualization, 
Service-oriented  architecture  and  utility  computing  which    originated  in  the  private  sector  where 
virtualization  technology  and  large  data  centers  have  been  turned  into  the  foundation  for  products  and 
services to be resold. This section will help clarify the difference between the two. Subsequent sections will 
focus primarily on grid computing, as  cloud computing still lacks any  substantive standards or possibilities 
for  interoperation,  making  any  discussion  around  cloud  computing  and  the  telecommunications  industry 
purely  speculative.  The  grid  concept  has  a  complementary  but  independent  relationship  to  the  concept  of 
cloud computing. The similarities are that both aim to provide access to a large computing (CPU) or storage 
(disk) resource. Current cloud environments only provide direct support for single user or single organization 
access, and current models typically have a high cost to integrate computing, data, or network transfers from 
outside of the cloud. 

         This  model  suits  environments  where  computing  and  data  resource  needs  can  be  isolated  to  a  single 
location and rapid scaling (up or  down) of computing, network, and data availability are important. Pricing 
models  are  variations  on  normalized  CPU-hours,  GB/day  storage,  and  MB  network  I/O,  or  are  based  on  a 
cloud product that can be licensed and used with local physical resources. In contrast, grid computing aims to 
provide  a  standard  set  of  services  and  software  that  enable  the  collaborative  sharing  of  federated  and 
geographically distributed computing and storage resources. It provides a security framework for identifying 
inter-organizational  parties  (both  human  and  electronic),  managing  data  access  and  movement,  and 
utilization of remote computing resources. Cloud computing offers a solution to the problem of organizations 
that need resources (computing, storage, or network bandwidth) either quickly or with a highly dynamic level 
of  demand.  Operating  in  steady  state  at  or  near  full  capacity,  cloud  computing  is  still  more  expensive  than

Grid models are either explicitly stated or implicitly defined in a particular implementation. As a minimum, 
all  grid  models  address  security,  networking,  computing  resources,  storage  resources,  and  information 
systems.  How  these  areas  are  brought  together,  and  what  services,  systems,  and  sub-systems  provide  a

Abstract  
 
A  Next  generation  network  (NGN)  is  a  packet-based  network  which  can  provide  services  including 
Telecommunication  Services  and  able  to  make  use  of  multiple  broadband,  Quality  of  Service-enabled 
transport  technologies  and  in  which  service-related  functions  are  independent  from  underlying  transport-
related technologies. The goal of NGN is to provide a more flexible network infrastructure that supports not 
just data and voice traffic routing, but also higher level services and interfaces for third party enhancements. 
Within this paper, opportunities to integrate grid and cloud computing strategies and standards into NGN are 
considered. The importance of standardized interfaces and interoperability testing demanded by carrier-grade 
networks  are  discussed.  Finally,  a  proposal  how  the  testing  methods  developed  at  the  European 
Telecommunications  Standards  Institute  (ETSI)  can  be  applied  to  improve  the  quality  of  standards  and 
implementations is presented.

1.  Introduction 
 

             A  NGN  is  a  broad  term  to  describe  key  architectural  evolutions  in  telecommunication  core  and 
access  networks.  The  general  idea  behind  the  NGN  is  that  one  network  transports  all  information  and 
services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into packets, like it is on 
the Internet. NGNs are commonly built   around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term "all-IP" is also 
sometimes used to describe the transformation toward NGN.  
                   Telecom operators are bound to become key players in a grid and cloud computing value chain as 
they  provide  connectivity  and  own  computing  resources.  Moreover  they  have  established  customer 
relationships and accounting/billing experience, essential for business/commercial grids and clouds. Defining 
the best ways to integrate existing as well as future telecommunication equipment and network infrastructure

with grids and clouds assumes the availability of interoperable Grid solutions built by IT in conjunction  with 
the  Telecom  industry  .Carrier-grade  networks  form  the  global  communications  infrastructure  that  support 
millions  of  phone  calls  each  day  and,  even  more  importantly,  the  massive  global  data  transfers, 
predominantly  resulting  from  the  Internet.  These  carrier-grade  networks  are  operated  by  hundreds  of 
companies often deployed on top of physical infrastructure (cabling and switches). These infrastructures are 
usually not owned by the network operator but have to follow different regulations in each country and likely 
traverse  several  billing  domains  at  any  given  point-to-point  connection.  This  globally  integrated  system 
operates with extremely low down time and transparently to the end users. The latest evolution of the global 
communications networks, the Next Generation Network (NGN), is designed to support converged fixed and 
wireless  networks  carrying  both  voice  and  data  traffic.  These  future  networks  incorporate  a  richer  set  of 
features  to  provide  more  services  to  customers,  and  hence  increased  revenue  opportunities  for  the  network 
providers. Increased flexibility around network-level services has also opened the door to third party services 
built  on  top  of  the  NGN  infrastructure.  Grid  and  cloud  computing  systems  would  benefit  from  enhanced 
capabilities of NGN, the global reach of existing communications networks, and the stability of carrier-grade 
networks.  Interoperability  has  been  one  of  the  key  contributors  to  widespread  commercial  success  of 
technologies  used  in  the  telecommunications  sector,  due  to  the  interconnected  nature  of  networks,  and  the 
plethora of network operators. Interoperability fosters diversity as well as competition in a market. Vendors 
can  achieve  interoperability  of  their  products  only  if  they  agree  and  implement  a  common  set  of  open 
standards.  The  value  of  standardization  has  also  been  recognized  by  the  grid  community,  and  is 
predominantly championed by the Open Grid Forum (OGF) [1] for grid-specific standards. Standardization, 
however,  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  interoperability.  In  this  article,  the  accomplishments  of  the  work 
completed  by  the  Technical  Committee  GRID  (TC  GRID)of  the  European  Telecommunications  Standards 
Institute (ETSI)[2] are reported. The interoperability events are used to compare various implementations in a 
controlled  setting  and  can  provide  detailed  feedback  on  the  quality  of  a  standard  based  on  the  level  of 
interoperability  that  is  achieved.  In  the  longer  term,  ETSI plans  to  establish  standards  that  will  support  the 
convergence between NGN, grid, and cloud computing environments.

        The NGN [9] is a global initiative from the telecoms industry using standards developed by ETSI and 
the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) [10]. 
This  involves  also  members  of  ETSI  TC  Telecoms  and  Internet  converged  Services  and  Protocols  for 
Advanced  Network  (TISPAN)  that  include  telecom  operators  such  as  British  Telecom,  like  with  other 
telecommunications technologies, such as ISDN or GSM, NGN standards intent to achieve interoperability. 
NGN is being designed to provide interoperable, inter-domain all IP-based network standards with enhanced 
multimedia capabilities. NGN offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. These include 
voice telephony, data services, multimedia services, virtual private networks, public network computing, and 
unified  messaging  [11].  The  NGN  design  has  aimed  to  support  a  dynamic  architecture  and  can,  therefore, 
accommodate  new  services  as  they  are  identified.  The  NGN  functional  architecture  that  is  defined  by 
TISPAN  [12]  identifies  two  NGN  layers.  IP-connectivity  is  provided  to  NGN  user  equipment  (UE)  by  the 
transport  layer,  under  the  control  of  the  Network  Attachment  Subsystem  (NASS)  and  the  Resource  and 
Admission Control Subsystem (RACS). 
 
         These subsystems hide the transport technology that is used in access and core networks below the IP 
layer. The service layer comprises the following subsystems: 
– PSTN/ISDN Emulation Subsystem (PES): PES supports the emulation of PSTN/ISDN 
services through residential gateways or access gateways for legacy terminals connected to the NGN. 
–  Core  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  Multimedia  Subsystem  (IMS):  IMS  supports  the  provisionof  Session  Initiated 
Protocol (SIP)-based services. 
– Other subsystems, e.g. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) dedicated subsystem) and 
applications. 

–  Common  components  for  accessing  applications,  charging  functions,  user  profile  management,  security 
management,  routing  databases  that  are  used  by  several  subsystems.  TISPAN  also  defines  an  Application 
Server  Function  (ASF)  [3]  that  can  provide  standalone  services  or  value  added  services  on  top  of  a  basic 
session. 
 
5.1 Convergence of NGN, Grid and Cloud Computing 
 
     For  telecom  operators,  the  future  lies  in  converging  fixed,  mobile  and  data  services  onto  NGN. 
Historically, each service  had its own platform  with  minimal interoperability. Integrating new services  was 
made  difficult  by  the  lack  of  interoperability,  resulting  in  high  development  and  deployment  costs,  and 
consequently  unattractive  rates  for  the  end  users.  Extending  the  NGN  subsystem  model  to  directly  provide 
grid services, or at least provide mechanisms by which third parties can develop and deploy onto NGN grid 
services,  would  be  the  basis  for  significant  new  revenue  potential  and  opportunities  for  a  new  era  of 
networked applications and services. With advances in commodity computer components in terms of speed, 
cost, and reliability, many parts of NGN can utilize commercial-off the- shelf (COTS) hardware, rather than 
high cost specialized chips, switches, and associated hardware. 
    NGN with cloud computing approaches which would allow a network operator to virtualized various NGN 
subsystems, thus providing dynamic scalability, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. The average load, could 
be  re-deployed  onto  a  more  efficient  shared  physical  infrastructure.  With  expertise  in  the  domain  of 
managing  virtualized  servers  for  NGN  operations  in  large  data  centers,  it  is  a  small  step  for  network 
operators  to  consider  partitioning  their  virtualized  server    platforms  and  making  these  available  as  cloud

Abstract  
 
A  Next  generation  network  (NGN)  is  a  packet-based  network  which  can  provide  services  including 
Telecommunication  Services  and  able  to  make  use  of  multiple  broadband,  Quality  of  Service-enabled 
transport  technologies  and  in  which  service-related  functions  are  independent  from  underlying  transport-
related technologies. The goal of NGN is to provide a more flexible network infrastructure that supports not 
just data and voice traffic routing, but also higher level services and interfaces for third party enhancements. 
Within this paper, opportunities to integrate grid and cloud computing strategies and standards into NGN are 
considered. The importance of standardized interfaces and interoperability testing demanded by carrier-grade 
networks  are  discussed.  Finally,  a  proposal  how  the  testing  methods  developed  at  the  European

1.  Introduction 
 

             A  NGN  is  a  broad  term  to  describe  key  architectural  evolutions  in  telecommunication  core  and 
access  networks.  The  general  idea  behind  the  NGN  is  that  one  network  transports  all  information  and 
services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into packets, like it is on 
the Internet. NGNs are commonly built   around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term "all-IP" is also 
sometimes used to describe the transformation toward NGN.  
                   Telecom operators are bound to become key players in a grid and cloud computing value chain as 
they  provide  connectivity  and  own  computing  resources.  Moreover  they  have  established  customer 
relationships and accounting/billing experience, essential for business/commercial grids and clouds. Defining

millions  of  phone  calls  each  day  and,  even  more  importantly,  the  massive  global  data  transfers, 
predominantly  resulting  from  the  Internet.  These  carrier-grade  networks  are  operated  by  hundreds  of 
companies often deployed on top of physical infrastructure (cabling and switches). These infrastructures are 
usually not owned by the network operator but have to follow different regulations in each country and likely

can  achieve  interoperability  of  their  products  only  if  they  agree  and  implement  a  common  set  of  open

2. Landscape for Grid, Cloud and NGN Domains 
 
The wide range of organizations involved with one or more of grid, cloud, and NGN technology each have 
their own priorities. Where operational systems have been designed or deployed, this range of priorities has 
resulted in competing architectures and interfaces. Although NGN does not yet exist as an integrated global 
telecommunications platform, there is a coordinated effort to develop the suite of standards to cover a high 
level NGN architecture [3]. In contrast, grid computing offers a few high level conceptual models, typically 
using the hour-glass middleware imagery. This envisages a wide range of high level applications connected 
to  a  wide  range  of  heterogeneous  low  level  resources  via  a  limited  number  of  intermediate  standard 
interfaces.  In  addition,  there  are  a  few  concrete  architectural  models  for  grid  infrastructures  [4,5].  These 
concrete  models  have  a  distinct  disconnection:  either  they  present  an    architecture  which  is  not  or  only

partially  implemented  in  any  operational  grid,  or  an  architecture  which  describes  a  particular  grid 
infrastructure with limited references to standards or interfaces. 
      In  the  cloud  domain,  there  is  currently  a  prevalence  of  independent  services  with  minimal  interest  in 
interoperability or consideration of standards. While this is in the process of changing, there is currently no 
sufficient activity in this area to report on. While the original motivation for grid computing originated with 
large  scientific  collaborations,  it  is  now  established  that  the  same  new  technology  and  perspective  on 
distributed  computing  is  applicable  in  many  domains.  The  Networked  European  Software  and  Services 
Initiative- Grid (NESSI-Grid) review considered the impact of grid technology on business IT infrastructure 
[6],  while  several  projects  have  considered  the  application  of  grid  computing  to  eHealth  .The  recent 
popularity  of  cloud  computing  also  demonstrates  the  industry  benefits  of  shared,  distributed  computing 
infrastructure. 
 
3. Differentiating Cloud Computing and Grid Computing 

   Grid computing is a term referring to the combination of computer resources from multiple administrative 
domains  to  reach  a  common  goal.  The  Grid  can  be  thought  of  as  a  distributed  system  with  non-interactive 
workloads  that  involve  a  large  number  of  files.  What  distinguishes  grid  computing  from  conventional  high 
performance  computing  systems  such  as  cluster  computing  is  that  grids  tend  to  be  more  loosely  coupled, 
heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a grid can be dedicated to a specialized application, it 
is  more  common  that  a  single  grid  will  be  used  for  a  variety  of  different  purposes.  Cloud  computing  is 
Internet-based  computing,  whereby  shared  resources,  software,  and  information  are  provided  to  computers 
and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a  adoption of virtualization, 
Service-oriented  architecture  and  utility  computing  which    originated  in  the  private  sector  where 
virtualization  technology  and  large  data  centers  have  been  turned  into  the  foundation  for  products  and 
services to be resold. This section will help clarify the difference between the two. Subsequent sections will 
focus primarily on grid computing, as  cloud computing still lacks any  substantive standards or possibilities 
for  interoperation,  making  any  discussion  around  cloud  computing  and  the  telecommunications  industry 
purely  speculative.  The  grid  concept  has  a  complementary  but  independent  relationship  to  the  concept  of 
cloud computing. The similarities are that both aim to provide access to a large computing (CPU) or storage 
(disk) resource. Current cloud environments only provide direct support for single user or single organization 
access, and current models typically have a high cost to integrate computing, data, or network transfers from 
outside of the cloud. 

         This  model  suits  environments  where  computing  and  data  resource  needs  can  be  isolated  to  a  single 
location and rapid scaling (up or  down) of computing, network, and data availability are important. Pricing 
models  are  variations  on  normalized  CPU-hours,  GB/day  storage,  and  MB  network  I/O,  or  are  based  on  a 
cloud product that can be licensed and used with local physical resources. In contrast, grid computing aims to 
provide  a  standard  set  of  services  and  software  that  enable  the  collaborative  sharing  of  federated  and 
geographically distributed computing and storage resources. It provides a security framework for identifying 
inter-organizational  parties  (both  human  and  electronic),  managing  data  access  and  movement,  and 
utilization of remote computing resources. Cloud computing offers a solution to the problem of organizations 
that need resources (computing, storage, or network bandwidth) either quickly or with a highly dynamic level 
of  demand.  Operating  in  steady  state  at  or  near  full  capacity,  cloud  computing  is  still  more  expensive  than

direct  ownership  of  computing  resources,  even  if  these  are  co-located  in  a  shared  data  center.  Cloud 
computing,  at  the  present  time,  also  only  offers  relatively  bare  bones  systems  on  top  of  which  a  user  or 
organization  needs to deploy  and  manage  their applications and data.  Grid computing can benefit  from the 
development  of  cloud  computing  by  harnessing  new  commercially  available  computing  and  storage 
resources,  and  by  deploying  cloud  technology  on  grid-enabled  resources  to  improve  the  management  and 
reliability of those resources via the virtualization layer. Cloud computing can benefit from grid concepts by 
integrating standard interfaces, federated access control, and distributed resource sharing.  
 
4. Standard Grid Models 
 
Grid models are either explicitly stated or implicitly defined in a particular implementation. As a minimum, 
all  grid  models  address  security,  networking,  computing  resources,  storage  resources,  and  information 
systems.  How  these  areas  are  brought  together,  and  what  services,  systems,  and  sub-systems  provide  a 
specific capability or interface, form the grid model and act as the basis for any standardization effort. The 
Globus project proposed the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) in 2002 [7], later refined in 2006 [4]. 
This  model  presents  a  grid  as  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture  (SOA).  To  discuss  grid  infrastructure  in  a 
telecoms context, ETSI TC GRID has a developed a working model [8]. This can be depicted as a layering of 
services which can be utilized independently or together. In Fig. 1, these are grouped by the type of services 
they deliver. The lowest level represents the foundation of the infrastructure: networking, storage, computing 
power, and preexisting software applications. These are wrapped and presented as software services.. These 
services  are  utilized  by  consumers,  customers  and  providers.  The  consumer  models  the  individual  or 
organization  using  a  grid  services.  The  customer  models  the  entity  responsible  for  contracting  the  grid 
services,  and  pays  for  usage  by  consumers  they  have  authorized. The  provider  models  the  entity  providing 
grid services.

        The NGN [9] is a global initiative from the telecoms industry using standards developed by ETSI and 
the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) [10]. 
This  involves  also  members  of  ETSI  TC  Telecoms  and  Internet  converged  Services  and  Protocols  for 
Advanced  Network  (TISPAN)  that  include  telecom  operators  such  as  British  Telecom,  like  with  other 
telecommunications technologies, such as ISDN or GSM, NGN standards intent to achieve interoperability. 
NGN is being designed to provide interoperable, inter-domain all IP-based network standards with enhanced 
multimedia capabilities. NGN offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. These include 
voice telephony, data services, multimedia services, virtual private networks, public network computing, and 
unified  messaging  [11].  The  NGN  design  has  aimed  to  support  a  dynamic  architecture  and  can,  therefore, 
accommodate  new  services  as  they  are  identified.  The  NGN  functional  architecture  that  is  defined  by 
TISPAN  [12]  identifies  two  NGN  layers.  IP-connectivity  is  provided  to  NGN  user  equipment  (UE)  by  the 
transport  layer,  under  the  control  of  the  Network  Attachment  Subsystem  (NASS)  and  the  Resource  and 
Admission Control Subsystem (RACS). 
 
         These subsystems hide the transport technology that is used in access and core networks below the IP 
layer. The service layer comprises the following subsystems: 
– PSTN/ISDN Emulation Subsystem (PES): PES supports the emulation of PSTN/ISDN 
services through residential gateways or access gateways for legacy terminals connected to the NGN. 
–  Core  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  Multimedia  Subsystem  (IMS):  IMS  supports  the  provisionof  Session  Initiated 
Protocol (SIP)-based services. 
– Other subsystems, e.g. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) dedicated subsystem) and 
applications. 

–  Common  components  for  accessing  applications,  charging  functions,  user  profile  management,  security 
management,  routing  databases  that  are  used  by  several  subsystems.  TISPAN  also  defines  an  Application 
Server  Function  (ASF)  [3]  that  can  provide  standalone  services  or  value  added  services  on  top  of  a  basic 
session. 
 
5.1 Convergence of NGN, Grid and Cloud Computing 
 
     For  telecom  operators,  the  future  lies  in  converging  fixed,  mobile  and  data  services  onto  NGN. 
Historically, each service  had its own platform  with  minimal interoperability. Integrating new services  was 
made  difficult  by  the  lack  of  interoperability,  resulting  in  high  development  and  deployment  costs,  and 
consequently  unattractive  rates  for  the  end  users.  Extending  the  NGN  subsystem  model  to  directly  provide 
grid services, or at least provide mechanisms by which third parties can develop and deploy onto NGN grid 
services,  would  be  the  basis  for  significant  new  revenue  potential  and  opportunities  for  a  new  era  of 
networked applications and services. With advances in commodity computer components in terms of speed, 
cost, and reliability, many parts of NGN can utilize commercial-off the- shelf (COTS) hardware, rather than 
high cost specialized chips, switches, and associated hardware. 
    NGN with cloud computing approaches which would allow a network operator to virtualized various NGN 
subsystems, thus providing dynamic scalability, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. The average load, could 
be  re-deployed  onto  a  more  efficient  shared  physical  infrastructure.  With  expertise  in  the  domain  of 
managing  virtualized  servers  for  NGN  operations  in  large  data  centers,  it  is  a  small  step  for  network 
operators  to  consider  partitioning  their  virtualized  server    platforms  and  making  these  available  as  cloud

computing services in a manner similar to the cloud services offered by  Amazon [13]Telecom operators are 
increasingly considering SOA in order to: 
– decouple applications via middleware from IT server/storage/network resources, 
– flexibly compose new services using standards-based technologies and protocols, 
– reuse architectural components to lower costs, and time-to-revenue. 
In summary, there are four possible scenarios: 
1. Grid-enabled NGN application 
2. NGN subsystems offering grid and cloud services 
3. Combining grid and networking resources in a new architecture 
4. Grid and cloud technology for implementing NGN functionality

In  the  first    scenario,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  3,  a  new  NGN  subsystem  is  added  to  the  NGN  Service  layer  to 
support  the  provisioning  of  grid  or  cloud  services.  This  Grid  Services  Subsystem  (GSS)  gives  access  to 
virtualized  grid-enabled  cloud  resources,  through  a  new  service  interface  to  the  virtual  resources  and  grid 
services.  
         In  the  second    scenario  “Combining  grid  and  networking  resources  in  a  new  architecture”  a  separate 
grid service manages shared resources such as computing power, network and storage. This would enable the 
assignment of resources to the grid or the NGN in a flexible, generic way. 
 The  third    scenario  “Grid  and  cloud  technology  for  implementing  NGN  functionality”  enhances  the  entire 
NGN  architecture  with  capabilities  for  harnessing  virtualized  cloud  resources  and  grid-enabled  services,  as 
depicted  in  Fig.  4.The  logical  NGN  functions  and  entire  NGN  subsystems  are  refined  in  light  of  grid  and 
cloud capabilities. This allows the optimization of the resources used by these functions and provides greater 
flexibility in the deployment and operation of various NGN subsystems.

2. Landscape for Grid, Cloud and NGN Domains 
 
The wide range of organizations involved with one or more of grid, cloud, and NGN technology each have 
their own priorities. Where operational systems have been designed or deployed, this range of priorities has 
resulted in competing architectures and interfaces. Although NGN does not yet exist as an integrated global 
telecommunications platform, there is a coordinated effort to develop the suite of standards to cover a high 
level NGN architecture [3]. In contrast, grid computing offers a few high level conceptual models, typically 
using the hour-glass middleware imagery. This envisages a wide range of high level applications connected 
to  a  wide  range  of  heterogeneous  low  level  resources  via  a  limited  number  of  intermediate  standard 
interfaces.  In  addition,  there  are  a  few  concrete  architectural  models  for  grid  infrastructures  [4,5].  These 
concrete  models  have  a  distinct  disconnection:  either  they  present  an    architecture  which  is  not  or  only

partially  implemented  in  any  operational  grid,  or  an  architecture  which  describes  a  particular  grid 
infrastructure with limited references to standards or interfaces. 
      In  the  cloud  domain,  there  is  currently  a  prevalence  of  independent  services  with  minimal  interest  in 
interoperability or consideration of standards. While this is in the process of changing, there is currently no 
sufficient activity in this area to report on. While the original motivation for grid computing originated with 
large  scientific  collaborations,  it  is  now  established  that  the  same  new  technology  and  perspective  on 
distributed  computing  is  applicable  in  many  domains.  The  Networked  European  Software  and  Services 
Initiative- Grid (NESSI-Grid) review considered the impact of grid technology on business IT infrastructure 
[6],  while  several  projects  have  considered  the  application  of  grid  computing  to  eHealth  .The  recent 
popularity  of  cloud  computing  also  demonstrates  the  industry  benefits  of  shared,  distributed  computing 
infrastructure. 
 
3. Differentiating Cloud Computing and Grid Computing 

   Grid computing is a term referring to the combination of computer resources from multiple administrative 
domains  to  reach  a  common  goal.  The  Grid  can  be  thought  of  as  a  distributed  system  with  non-interactive 
workloads  that  involve  a  large  number  of  files.  What  distinguishes  grid  computing  from  conventional  high 
performance  computing  systems  such  as  cluster  computing  is  that  grids  tend  to  be  more  loosely  coupled, 
heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a grid can be dedicated to a specialized application, it 
is  more  common  that  a  single  grid  will  be  used  for  a  variety  of  different  purposes.  Cloud  computing  is 
Internet-based  computing,  whereby  shared  resources,  software,  and  information  are  provided  to  computers 
and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a  adoption of virtualization, 
Service-oriented  architecture  and  utility  computing  which    originated  in  the  private  sector  where 
virtualization  technology  and  large  data  centers  have  been  turned  into  the  foundation  for  products  and 
services to be resold. This section will help clarify the difference between the two. Subsequent sections will 
focus primarily on grid computing, as  cloud computing still lacks any  substantive standards or possibilities 
for  interoperation,  making  any  discussion  around  cloud  computing  and  the  telecommunications  industry 
purely  speculative.  The  grid  concept  has  a  complementary  but  independent  relationship  to  the  concept  of 
cloud computing. The similarities are that both aim to provide access to a large computing (CPU) or storage 
(disk) resource. Current cloud environments only provide direct support for single user or single organization 
access, and current models typically have a high cost to integrate computing, data, or network transfers from 
outside of the cloud. 

         This  model  suits  environments  where  computing  and  data  resource  needs  can  be  isolated  to  a  single 
location and rapid scaling (up or  down) of computing, network, and data availability are important. Pricing 
models  are  variations  on  normalized  CPU-hours,  GB/day  storage,  and  MB  network  I/O,  or  are  based  on  a 
cloud product that can be licensed and used with local physical resources. In contrast, grid computing aims to 
provide  a  standard  set  of  services  and  software  that  enable  the  collaborative  sharing  of  federated  and 
geographically distributed computing and storage resources. It provides a security framework for identifying 
inter-organizational  parties  (both  human  and  electronic),  managing  data  access  and  movement,  and 
utilization of remote computing resources. Cloud computing offers a solution to the problem of organizations 
that need resources (computing, storage, or network bandwidth) either quickly or with a highly dynamic level 
of  demand.  Operating  in  steady  state  at  or  near  full  capacity,  cloud  computing  is  still  more  expensive  than

direct  ownership  of  computing  resources,  even  if  these  are  co-located  in  a  shared  data  center.  Cloud 
computing,  at  the  present  time,  also  only  offers  relatively  bare  bones  systems  on  top  of  which  a  user  or 
organization  needs to deploy  and  manage  their applications and data.  Grid computing can benefit  from the 
development  of  cloud  computing  by  harnessing  new  commercially  available  computing  and  storage 
resources,  and  by  deploying  cloud  technology  on  grid-enabled  resources  to  improve  the  management  and 
reliability of those resources via the virtualization layer. Cloud computing can benefit from grid concepts by 
integrating standard interfaces, federated access control, and distributed resource sharing.  
 
4. Standard Grid Models 
 
Grid models are either explicitly stated or implicitly defined in a particular implementation. As a minimum, 
all  grid  models  address  security,  networking,  computing  resources,  storage  resources,  and  information 
systems.  How  these  areas  are  brought  together,  and  what  services,  systems,  and  sub-systems  provide  a 
specific capability or interface, form the grid model and act as the basis for any standardization effort. The 
Globus project proposed the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) in 2002 [7], later refined in 2006 [4]. 
This  model  presents  a  grid  as  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture  (SOA).  To  discuss  grid  infrastructure  in  a 
telecoms context, ETSI TC GRID has a developed a working model [8]. This can be depicted as a layering of 
services which can be utilized independently or together. In Fig. 1, these are grouped by the type of services 
they deliver. The lowest level represents the foundation of the infrastructure: networking, storage, computing 
power, and preexisting software applications. These are wrapped and presented as software services.. These 
services  are  utilized  by  consumers,  customers  and  providers.  The  consumer  models  the  individual  or 
organization  using  a  grid  services.  The  customer  models  the  entity  responsible  for  contracting  the  grid 
services,  and  pays  for  usage  by  consumers  they  have  authorized. The  provider  models  the  entity  providing 
grid services.

        The NGN [9] is a global initiative from the telecoms industry using standards developed by ETSI and 
the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) [10]. 
This  involves  also  members  of  ETSI  TC  Telecoms  and  Internet  converged  Services  and  Protocols  for 
Advanced  Network  (TISPAN)  that  include  telecom  operators  such  as  British  Telecom,  like  with  other 
telecommunications technologies, such as ISDN or GSM, NGN standards intent to achieve interoperability. 
NGN is being designed to provide interoperable, inter-domain all IP-based network standards with enhanced 
multimedia capabilities. NGN offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. These include 
voice telephony, data services, multimedia services, virtual private networks, public network computing, and 
unified  messaging  [11].  The  NGN  design  has  aimed  to  support  a  dynamic  architecture  and  can,  therefore, 
accommodate  new  services  as  they  are  identified.  The  NGN  functional  architecture  that  is  defined  by 
TISPAN  [12]  identifies  two  NGN  layers.  IP-connectivity  is  provided  to  NGN  user  equipment  (UE)  by  the 
transport  layer,  under  the  control  of  the  Network  Attachment  Subsystem  (NASS)  and  the  Resource  and 
Admission Control Subsystem (RACS). 
 
         These subsystems hide the transport technology that is used in access and core networks below the IP 
layer. The service layer comprises the following subsystems: 
– PSTN/ISDN Emulation Subsystem (PES): PES supports the emulation of PSTN/ISDN 
services through residential gateways or access gateways for legacy terminals connected to the NGN. 
–  Core  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  Multimedia  Subsystem  (IMS):  IMS  supports  the  provisionof  Session  Initiated 
Protocol (SIP)-based services. 
– Other subsystems, e.g. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) dedicated subsystem) and 
applications. 

–  Common  components  for  accessing  applications,  charging  functions,  user  profile  management,  security 
management,  routing  databases  that  are  used  by  several  subsystems.  TISPAN  also  defines  an  Application 
Server  Function  (ASF)  [3]  that  can  provide  standalone  services  or  value  added  services  on  top  of  a  basic 
session. 
 
5.1 Convergence of NGN, Grid and Cloud Computing 
 
     For  telecom  operators,  the  future  lies  in  converging  fixed,  mobile  and  data  services  onto  NGN. 
Historically, each service  had its own platform  with  minimal interoperability. Integrating new services  was 
made  difficult  by  the  lack  of  interoperability,  resulting  in  high  development  and  deployment  costs,  and 
consequently  unattractive  rates  for  the  end  users.  Extending  the  NGN  subsystem  model  to  directly  provide 
grid services, or at least provide mechanisms by which third parties can develop and deploy onto NGN grid 
services,  would  be  the  basis  for  significant  new  revenue  potential  and  opportunities  for  a  new  era  of 
networked applications and services. With advances in commodity computer components in terms of speed, 
cost, and reliability, many parts of NGN can utilize commercial-off the- shelf (COTS) hardware, rather than 
high cost specialized chips, switches, and associated hardware. 
    NGN with cloud computing approaches which would allow a network operator to virtualized various NGN 
subsystems, thus providing dynamic scalability, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. The average load, could 
be  re-deployed  onto  a  more  efficient  shared  physical  infrastructure.  With  expertise  in  the  domain  of 
managing  virtualized  servers  for  NGN  operations  in  large  data  centers,  it  is  a  small  step  for  network 
operators  to  consider  partitioning  their  virtualized  server    platforms  and  making  these  available  as  cloud

computing services in a manner similar to the cloud services offered by  Amazon [13]Telecom operators are 
increasingly considering SOA in order to: 
– decouple applications via middleware from IT server/storage/network resources, 
– flexibly compose new services using standards-based technologies and protocols, 
– reuse architectural components to lower costs, and time-to-revenue. 
In summary, there are four possible scenarios: 
1. Grid-enabled NGN application 
2. NGN subsystems offering grid and cloud services 
3. Combining grid and networking resources in a new architecture 
4. Grid and cloud technology for implementing NGN functionality 
 
       

 

Fig. 3 NGN subsystems offering grid and cloud services         Fig. 4 Grid and cloud for implementing NGN functionality 
 
 
In  the  first    scenario,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  3,  a  new  NGN  subsystem  is  added  to  the  NGN  Service  layer  to 
support  the  provisioning  of  grid  or  cloud  services.  This  Grid  Services  Subsystem  (GSS)  gives  access  to 
virtualized  grid-enabled  cloud  resources,  through  a  new  service  interface  to  the  virtual  resources  and  grid 
services.  
         In  the  second    scenario  “Combining  grid  and  networking  resources  in  a  new  architecture”  a  separate 
grid service manages shared resources such as computing power, network and storage. This would enable the 
assignment of resources to the grid or the NGN in a flexible, generic way. 
 The  third    scenario  “Grid  and  cloud  technology  for  implementing  NGN  functionality”  enhances  the  entire 
NGN  architecture  with  capabilities  for  harnessing  virtualized  cloud  resources  and  grid-enabled  services,  as 
depicted  in  Fig.  4.The  logical  NGN  functions  and  entire  NGN  subsystems  are  refined  in  light  of  grid  and 
cloud capabilities. This allows the optimization of the resources used by these functions and provides greater 
flexibility in the deployment and operation of various NGN subsystems.

Conclusion 
          Telecom  operators  are  expecting  that  grid  enabled  services  can  improve  their  internal  network 
operation as well as enrich the services they offer to their customers. For this, interoperability between grid 
technology  and  telecom  networks  has  to  be  achieved.  ETSI  and  its  TC  GRID  have  a  key  role  to  play  in 
establishing  priorities,  standards,  and  testing  mechanisms.  ETSI  intends  to  continue  standardizing  software 
protocols and interfaces relevant to NGN and adopting grid and cloud computing technology into the global 
telecommunications  network.  The  telecom  industry  will  gain  valuable  experience  with  third  party  services 
and sub-systems offering advanced functionality with the roll-out of NGN. We expect that this roll-out will 
lead to increased efforts to develop interoperating grid, cloud, and telecom systems.
