1. Introduction 

and  promising  platform 

Cloud  computing  is  positioning  itself  as  a 
new 
for  delivering 
information 
infrastructure  and  resources  as  IT 
services. Customers can then access these services to 
execute  their  business  jobs  in  a  pay-as-you-go 
fashion while saving huge capital investment in their 
own  IT  infrastructure  [1].  The  cloud  offers  several 
benefits  like  fast  deployment,  pay-for-use,  lower 
costs, scalability, rapid provisioning, rapid elasticity, 
ubiquitous  network  access,  greater 
resiliency, 
hypervisor  protection  against  network  attacks,  low-
cost disaster recovery and data storage solutions, on-
demand  security  controls,  real  time  detection  of 
system 
tampering  and  rapid  re-constitution  of 
services.  While  the  cloud  offers  these  advantages, 
until some of the risks are better understood, many of 
the  major  players  will  be  tempted  to  holdback  [3]. 
According  to  a  recent  IDCI  survey,  74%  of  IT 
executives  and  CIO’s  cited  security  as  the  top 
challenge  preventing  their  adoption  of  the  cloud 
services  model  [2].  Customers  often  have  concerns 
about  whether  their  privacy  can  be  protected  when 
facilitating  services  in  the  cloud,  since  they  do  not 
have much control inside the cloud. Correspondingly, 
privacy  protection  has  become  a  critical  issue  and 
one  of  most  concerning.  Without  it,  customers  may 
eventually lose the confidence in and desire to deploy 
cloud computing in practice [1]. So some researchers 
notice  that  cloud  computing  should  provide  key 
elements  of  the  necessary  architectural  change  to 
segregate clients from mass data and applications [4]. 
Examples is, with the emergence of cloud computing, 
multi-billion dollar organizations like IBM, Amazon, 
Google  and  Ebay  have  already  invested  in  cloud 
technology.  If  extortionists  threaten  to  bring  down 
their  Cloud  System  with  a  Distributed  Denial  of 

to 

Service (DDoS) attack, which is for this paper means 
many  nodes  systems  attacking  one  node  all  at  the 
same  time  with  a  flood  of  messages,  it  is  usually 
better  for  a  corporation  to  pay  the  ransom  than  see 
their systems go offline (Fowler, 2009). However, it 
is  not  only  extortionists  that  can  exploit  cloud 
computing.  For 
example,  Amazon  or  Ebay 
competitors  could  also  use  known  vulnerabilities  to 
interrupt the normal operations of their cloud system 
so their customers move onto the next  business that 
can  provide  them  with  the  service  they  require. 
Renting out its sky-high computer infrastructure from 
Amazon,  this  actual  example  happened 
the 
BitBucket.com  cloud,  who  according  to  the  report, 
went down for 19h. X-DoS and its distributed version, 
Distributed XML-based DoS (DX-DoS) occurs when 
an  XML  message  is  sent  to  a  Web  Server  or  Web 
Service  with  malicious  content  to  use  up  all  their 
resources. One example of an X-DoS attack is called 
a  Coercive  Parsing  attack,  which  manipulates  the 
Web Service Request  when a Simple Object  Access 
Protocol  (SOAP)  is  parsed  to  it  so  that  it  can 
transform  the  content  to  make  it  accessible  to 
applications.  The  Coercive  Parsing  attack  uses  a 
continuous  sequence  of  open  tags  so  that  the  CPU 
usage on an Axis2 web server becomes exhausted [5]. 
In this paper, we propose advanced security 
framework model for cloud computing environment. 
Generally  cloud  computing  technology  has  3  main 
factors,  PaaS 
IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Services) and SaaS (Software as a 
Services).  So  this  framework has  3 layers  for  them, 
and each module for security is in 3 layers.

Actually, in side of software has very weak 
for  security  and  protect  from  the  other  access  or 
attack.  In  SaaS,  the  client  has  to  depend  on  the 
provider  for  proper  security  measures.  The  provider 
must do the work to keep multiple users’ from seeing 
each other’s data. So it becomes difficult to the user 
to ensure that right security measures are in place and 
also difficult to get assurance that the application will 
be  available  when  needed.  With  SaaS,  the  cloud 
customer  will  by  definition  be  substituting  new 
software  applications  for  old  ones.  Therefore,  the 
focus  is not  upon  portability  of  applications,  but  on 
preserving  or  enhancing  the  security  functionality 
provided  by  the  legacy  application  and  achieving  a 
successful  data  migration.  So,  S.  Subashini,  V. 
Kavitha [2] proposed Security workflow for the SaaS 
as shown in Figure 2.

In 

this  contents,  we  propose  advanced 
security framework for cloud computing environment.  
Especially  we  design  each  module  in  three  layers, 
SaaS,  PaaS,  and  IaaS.    Figure  3  shows  proposal 
structure for security cloud computing by three layers.

Abstract:  Cloud computing technology is a new trend of IT  (Information Technology) .  In this environment, all 
users can share their information and experience very easily. However it is hard to keep their own information such 
as a private data. Actually, cloud computing can be open their data and is difficult to protect the user data from the 
access  or  attack  to  the  system.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  security  framework  model  for  cloud  computing 
environments. In order to make this framework, we make a structure for each module in 3 layers, PaaS, IaaS and 
SaaS.

1. Introduction 

and  promising  platform 

Cloud  computing  is  positioning  itself  as  a 
new 
for  delivering 
information 
infrastructure  and  resources  as  IT 
services. Customers can then access these services to 
execute  their  business  jobs  in  a  pay-as-you-go 
fashion while saving huge capital investment in their 
own  IT  infrastructure  [1].  The  cloud  offers  several 
benefits  like  fast  deployment,  pay-for-use,  lower 
costs, scalability, rapid provisioning, rapid elasticity, 
ubiquitous  network  access,  greater 
resiliency, 
hypervisor  protection  against  network  attacks,  low-
cost disaster recovery and data storage solutions, on-
demand  security  controls,  real  time  detection  of 
system 
tampering  and  rapid  re-constitution  of 
services.  While  the  cloud  offers  these  advantages, 
until some of the risks are better understood, many of 
the  major  players  will  be  tempted  to  holdback  [3]. 
According  to  a  recent  IDCI  survey,  74%  of  IT 
executives  and  CIO’s  cited  security  as  the  top 
challenge  preventing  their  adoption  of  the  cloud 
services  model  [2].  Customers  often  have  concerns 
about  whether  their  privacy  can  be  protected  when 
facilitating  services  in  the  cloud,  since  they  do  not 
have much control inside the cloud. Correspondingly, 
privacy  protection  has  become  a  critical  issue  and 
one  of  most  concerning.  Without  it,  customers  may 
eventually lose the confidence in and desire to deploy 
cloud computing in practice [1]. So some researchers 
notice  that  cloud  computing  should  provide  key 
elements  of  the  necessary  architectural  change  to 
segregate clients from mass data and applications [4]. 
Examples is, with the emergence of cloud computing, 
multi-billion dollar organizations like IBM, Amazon, 
Google  and  Ebay  have  already  invested  in  cloud 
technology.  If  extortionists  threaten  to  bring  down 
their  Cloud  System  with  a  Distributed  Denial  of 

to 

Service (DDoS) attack, which is for this paper means 
many  nodes  systems  attacking  one  node  all  at  the 
same  time  with  a  flood  of  messages,  it  is  usually 
better  for  a  corporation  to  pay  the  ransom  than  see 
their systems go offline (Fowler, 2009). However, it 
is  not  only  extortionists  that  can  exploit  cloud 
computing.  For 
example,  Amazon  or  Ebay 
competitors  could  also  use  known  vulnerabilities  to 
interrupt the normal operations of their cloud system 
so their customers move onto the next  business that 
can  provide  them  with  the  service  they  require. 
Renting out its sky-high computer infrastructure from 
Amazon,  this  actual  example  happened 
the 
BitBucket.com  cloud,  who  according  to  the  report, 
went down for 19h. X-DoS and its distributed version, 
Distributed XML-based DoS (DX-DoS) occurs when 
an  XML  message  is  sent  to  a  Web  Server  or  Web 
Service  with  malicious  content  to  use  up  all  their 
resources. One example of an X-DoS attack is called 
a  Coercive  Parsing  attack,  which  manipulates  the 
Web Service Request  when a Simple Object  Access 
Protocol  (SOAP)  is  parsed  to  it  so  that  it  can 
transform  the  content  to  make  it  accessible  to 
applications.  The  Coercive  Parsing  attack  uses  a 
continuous  sequence  of  open  tags  so  that  the  CPU 
usage on an Axis2 web server becomes exhausted [5]. 
In this paper, we propose advanced security 
framework model for cloud computing environment. 
Generally  cloud  computing  technology  has  3  main 
factors,  PaaS 
IaaS 
(Infrastructure as a Services) and SaaS (Software as a 
Services).  So  this  framework has  3 layers  for  them, 
and each module for security is in 3 layers.

Cloud  computing  is  attracting  more  and 
more  users.  In  addition  to  the  common  customers

from industry, researchers out of the scientific fields 
are also joining the Cloud world. The reason for the 
success  of  Cloud  computing  lies  in  its  easy-to-use 
computing  model  and  the  benefits  it  brings  to  the 
users.  We  see  the  following  features  from  Cloud 
computing [9]: 

where  the  application  has  usually  to  be 
adapted to the target architecture. 
 
A  majority  of 

the  cloud  computing 
definitions, including on-demand, pay-by-use model, 
virtualized  and  dynamically-scalable,  have 
the 
characteristics  of  cloud  computing.  And  it  applies 
novel  diverse  computing 
types,  such  as  SaaS 
(Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), 
utility  computing,  web  services  in  the  cloud,  MSP 
(Managed  Service  Providers),  service  commerce 
platforms,  and  Internet  integration.  Furthermore, 
these  computing  types  are  based  on  new  payments, 
new  deployments  and  new  updated/maintained 
mechanisms  [6].  Also  cloud  computing  offers  the 
opportunity to store a huge amount of data relatively 
cheaply.  Using  the  cloud,  users  can  access  the 
services or applications regardless of their location or 
computing  device/platform 
they  use.  However, 
despite  all  these  benefits  the  cloud  has  to  offer, 
privacy and security issues are still major challenges 
of  cloud  computing. There  are many  security  issues 
to  consider,  including:  fine  grained  access  to  cloud 
resources, privacy protection of data in the cloud, and 
auditing  of  cloud  operations.  Some  threat  models 
assume that the cloud provider cannot be trusted, and 
therefore propose storing only encrypted data in the 
cloud. Others assume that the cloud provider can be

in 

 

 
Elasticity.  Cloud  computing  provides  users 
with 
the  amount  of 
requested resources,  e.g. size of the storage 
and  number  of  the  processors/machines. 
This  feature  is  rather  helpful  for  scenarios 
like  “Web  service  operators need  to  add  or 
remove servers depending on the number of 
users”. 
Economy.  In  Cloud  computing,  customers 
pay  only  what 
they  used.  For  small 
companies  or  research  groups,  the  cost  for 
using Cloud resources can be much cheaper 
than investing and maintaining an own local 
system. 
Reliability.  Cloud systems are fault tolerant 
them  are  highly 
and 
available. 
  On-demand.  Cloud  computing  provides 
users with customized environments that are 
tailed to individual requirement. This feature 
is  more  user  friendly  than  Grid  computing

trusted,  and  that  the  threats  come  primarily  from 
outside  attackers  and  other  cloud  users  [7].  In  ths 
contents,  Imad  and  Andrew  [8]  notified 
three 
examples as below. 

the 

  A  Cloud  user  (that  is,  the  trustor)  wants  to 
establish ‘trust’ in the ability of the trustee (i.e. 
Cloud  infrastructure  and  Cloud  provider)  to 
provide  some  service  S,  and  to  enforce  an 
agreed policy P, when both the trustor and the 
trustee have behaviour B. 

  Similarly, 

provider 

trustor  could  be  a  Cloud 
provider  or  a  collaborating  Clouds-of-Clouds 
who want to establish ‘trust’ in the ability of 
the  trustee  (the  Cloud  infrastructure,  or  the 
collaborating  Cloud 
its 
infrastructure) to provide some service S, and 
to enforce an agreed policy P,  when both the 
Trustor and the Trustee have behaviour B. 
  When the trustor is a customer of a Cloud user, 
and the customer wants to establish ‘trust’ in 
the  ability  of  the  trustee  (i.e.  Cloud  user 
resources  which  are  hosted  at  the  Cloud 
infrastructure) to provide some service S, and 
to enforce an agreed policy P,  when both the 
Trustor and the Trustee have behaviour B.

Actually, in side of software has very weak 
for  security  and  protect  from  the  other  access  or 
attack.  In  SaaS,  the  client  has  to  depend  on  the 
provider  for  proper  security  measures.  The  provider 
must do the work to keep multiple users’ from seeing 
each other’s data. So it becomes difficult to the user 
to ensure that right security measures are in place and 
also difficult to get assurance that the application will 
be  available  when  needed.  With  SaaS,  the  cloud 
customer  will  by  definition  be  substituting  new 
software  applications  for  old  ones.  Therefore,  the 
focus  is not  upon  portability  of  applications,  but  on 
preserving  or  enhancing  the  security  functionality 
provided  by  the  legacy  application  and  achieving  a 
successful  data  migration.  So,  S.  Subashini,  V. 
Kavitha [2] proposed Security workflow for the SaaS 
as shown in Figure 2.

security framework for cloud computing environment.  
Especially  we  design  each  module  in  three  layers, 
SaaS,  PaaS,  and  IaaS.    Figure  3  shows  proposal
