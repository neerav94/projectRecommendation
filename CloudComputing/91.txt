Abstract—Cloud  computing  provides  flexible  on  demand  services  to  the  end  users  with  lesser  infrastructural 
investment. Under the supervision of different managements, these services are provided over the Internet using 
known  networking  protocols,  standards  and  formats.  Existing  deficiencies  in  underlying  technologies  tend  to 
open doors for intrusion. This paper surveys different intrusions affecting basics of cloud security i.e. availability, 
confidentiality  and  integrity  of  Cloud  resources  and  services.  It  examines  proposals  incorporating  Intrusion 
Detection Systems (IDS) in Cloud and discusses various types and techniques of IDS.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Goal of Cloud  computing  is to provide convenient, on-demand  network access to a computing 
resources. Cloud provides services in various forms: Software as a Service-SaaS, Platform as a 
Service-  PaaS  and  Infrastructure  as  Service-IaaS[6].  In  this  world  of  Internet,  security  and 
privacy  of  Cloud  services  are  key  issues.  Data  security  is  the  greatest  challenge  of  Cloud 
computing and after that intrusion detection in cloud infrastructures. Cloud infrastructure makes 
use  of  virtualization  techniques,  integrated  technologies  and  runs  through  standard  Internet 
protocols[19].  These  may  attract  intruders  due  to  much  vulnerability  involved  in  it.  Cloud 
computing also suffers from various traditional attacks such as IP spoofing, Routing information 
Protocol  attack,  Flooding,  Denial  of  Service  (DoS),  Distributed  Denial  of  Service  (DDoS)  etc. 
Firewall  can  be  a  good  option  to  prevent  outside  attacks  but  does  not  work  for  insider 
attacks[12].  Efficient  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS)  should  be  incorporated  in  Cloud 
infrastructure. Rest of the paper is organized as follows.

II. INTRUSIONS TO CLOUD SYSTEMS 
This  section  illustrates  several  common  attacks  (intrusions),  which  causes  availability, 
confidentiality and integrity issues to Cloud resources and services.  
 
A. Insider attack 
The person who could access the whole information system with privileged authority are defined 
as  insider.  Insider  attacks  are  organized  and  performed  by  these  individuals  to  destroy  or 
manipulate the knowledge about system or providers and include every kind of attacks which can 
possibly  be  executed  from  inside[11].  Authorized  Cloud  users  may  attempt  to  misuse 
unauthorized  privileges.  Insiders  may  commit  frauds  and  destroy  information  or  they  may 
disclose information to others. This poses a serious trust issue[6].  
 
B. Flooding attack 
In  this  type  of  attack,  attackers  can  send  very  large  amounts  of  packets  from  exploited 
information resources, and they are called as zombie (innocent host) [11]. Here, attacker tries to 
flood  victim  by  sending  huge  number  of  packets  from  innocent  host  (zombies)  in  network.  
Packets  can  be  either  one  of  TCP,  ICMP,  UDP  or  a  mix  of  these  protocols.  These  kinds  of 
attacks are mostly realized over unauthorized network connections. Because of cloud computing 
paradigms’ nature, connections to the virtual machines are established everywhere over Internet. 
For this reason, exposition of cloud users with Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) attacks are inevitable[8]. Flooding attacks affect the availability of serviced for 
authorized  users.  An  attack  that  is  realized  to  a  server  which  serves  one  kind  of  service  can 
prevent a vast of scale accessibility to this served service. These kinds of attacks are called DoS 
attacks. If servers’ resources are slogged after flooding attacks and  it prevents the execution of 
other services, which run on the server, this kind of attacks are called indirect DoS attacks[6]. 
 
C. User to Root attacks 
In this type of attack, an intruder seizes the account and password information of an authorized 
user,  and  he  can  acquire  limitless  access  to  the  whole  system  [11].  This  makes  him  able  to 
exploit vulnerabilities for gaining root level access to system For example; Buffer overflows are 
used  to  generate  root  shells  from  a  process  running  as  root.  Buffer  overflows  are  used  for 
establish console connection for authorized processes. This type of intrusion can be realized with 
writing an excessive amount of data to a statically defined buffers’ capacity, and the information 
is  captured  by  intruders  from  this  overflowed  data.  An  attacker  who  owned  the  account  and 
password information of an authorized user can hold the access privilege to servers and also to 
virtual machines[12].  
 
D. Port Scanning 
An attack that identifies open, closed and filtered ports on a system [11]. Through port scanning, 
attackers  can  find  open  ports  and  attack  on  services  running  on  these  ports.  Network  related

Ashish Kumbhare et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 497-502 

details  such  as  IP  address,  MAC  address,  router,  gateway  filtering,  firewall  rules  etc.  can  be 
known through this attack. Various port scanning techniques are TCP scanning, UDP scanning, 
SYN  scanning,  FIN  scanning,  ACK  scanning,  Window  scanning  (same  as  ACK  scan  but  it 
checks  any  modifications  in  the  window  field  of  packet)  etc.    Port  scanning  is  not  used  by  its 
own, an intruder realize the actual attack after getting information about open ports and running 
services. 
 
E. Attacks on Virtual Machine (VM) or hypervisor 
After compromising  hypervisor, control of the  virtual  machines  in the  virtual  environment will 
be captured [11]. Zero day  attacks are one of the  methods that attack virtual  machines and use 
hypervisor or other virtual machines to attack other virtual machines.  A zeroday vulnerability is 
a threat that tries to exploit application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or the software 
developer.  Zero  day  attacks  use  known  vulnerabilities  before  system  or  software  developers 
apply  patches  or  updates.  Multiple  virtual  machines  use  the  same  resource  pool,  especially 
hardware and with this kind of access side channel data has a chance to be captured, which flow 
one  virtual  machine  to  other  [12].  A  zero-day  vulnerability  was  exploited  in  the  HyperVM 
virtualization  application  which  resulted  in  destruction  of  many  virtual  server  based  websites 
[17]. 
 
F. Backdoor channel attacks 
It is a passive attack which allows hackers to gain remote access to the infected node in order to 
compromise  user  confidentiality.  Using  backdoor  channels,  hackers  can  control  victim’s 
resources and can make it as zombie to attempt DDoS attack[9]. It can also be used to disclose 
the confidential data of victim. Due to this, compromised system faces difficulty in performing 
its  regular  tasks.  In  Cloud  environment,  attacker  can  get  access  and  control  Cloud  user’s 
resources through backdoor channel and make VM as  Zombie to initiate DoS/DDoS attack. For 
insider  attacks,  signature  based  intrusion  detection  solutions  can  normally  be  used[20].  To 
prevent  attacks  on  VM/Hypervisor,  anomaly  based  intrusion  detection  techniques  can  be  used. 
For  flooding  attack  and  backdoor  channel  attack,  either  signature  based  intrusion  detection  or 
anomaly based intrusion detection techniques can be used[18]. Firewall (in Cloud) could be the 
common solution to prevent some of the attacks listed above. 
  
III. INTRUSION DETECTION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
As detailed in previous section, there are different types of attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems 
(IDSs)  are  one  of  the  practical  solutions  to  resist  these  attacks.  IDSs  are  systems  that  realize 
intrusion  detection,  log  detected  information,  alert  or  perform  predefined  procedures  [17,  18]. 
They  can  be  either  hardware  or  software  that  includes  whole  observed  computing  entities. 
Mainly there are three types of IDS in cloud computing systems: Host based IDS, Network based 
IDS, and Distributed IDS.

its  regular  tasks.  In  Cloud  environment,  attacker  can  get  access  and  control  Cloud  user’s 
resources through backdoor channel and make VM as  Zombie to initiate DoS/DDoS attack. For 
insider  attacks,  signature  based  intrusion  detection  solutions  can  normally  be  used[20].  To 
prevent  attacks  on  VM/Hypervisor,  anomaly  based  intrusion  detection  techniques  can  be  used. 
For  flooding  attack  and  backdoor  channel  attack,  either  signature  based  intrusion  detection  or 
anomaly based intrusion detection techniques can be used[18]. Firewall (in Cloud) could be the 
common solution to prevent some of the attacks listed above. 
  
III. INTRUSION DETECTION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
As detailed in previous section, there are different types of attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems 
(IDSs)  are  one  of  the  practical  solutions  to  resist  these  attacks.  IDSs  are  systems  that  realize 
intrusion  detection,  log  detected  information,  alert  or  perform  predefined  procedures  [17,  18]. 
They  can  be  either  hardware  or  software  that  includes  whole  observed  computing  entities. 
Mainly there are three types of IDS in cloud computing systems: Host based IDS, Network based 
IDS, and Distributed IDS.

A. Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems 
Host-based  Intrusion  Detection  System  was  the  first  type  of  intrusion  detection  software  to  be 
designed,  with  the  original  target  system  being  the  mainframe  computer  where  outside 
interaction was infrequent [6]. Host-based IDSs operate on information collected from within an 
individual computer system. A Host-based IDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from 
the  computer  system  only  and  would  alert  the  user  or  administrator  if  suspicious  activity  is 
detected [5][1].  Host Based IDSs analyze the suspicious activities like system call, processes or 
thread, asset and configuration access by observing the situation of host. It is especially used to 
protect valuable and private information on server systems. HIDS is composed of sensors located 
on servers or workstations which  are  made to prevent the attacks to a host[1]. An HIDS  is  not 
just monitor network traffic, it can also trace more and settle with local settings of an OS and log 
records. 
 

B. Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems 
Network-based  Intrusion  Detection  Systems  focus  more  greatly  on  the  network than  a  specific 
host. Network-based IDS detects attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets. Listening 
on  a  network  segment  or  switch,  one  network-based  IDS  can  monitor  the  network  traffic 
affecting  multiple  hosts  that  are  connected  to  the  network  segment,  thereby  protecting  those 
hosts[13]. Network-based IDSs often consist of a set of single purpose sensors placed at various 
points  in  a  network.  Network-based  IDSs  (NIDS)  observe,  monitor  and  analyses  the  specified 
and pre-identified network traffic. It can detect different situations based on specified points and 
generally  located  between  the  end  point  devices  like  routers,  firewalls[1][13].  A  NIDS  is  an 
intrusion  detection  system  that  attempts  to  discover  unauthorized  access  to  a  network  by 
analyzing  traffic  on  the  network  for  signs  of  malicious  activities  and  events.  Network  traffic 
stacks on different layers and every layer delivers the data coming from a layer to another layer 
[1].  OSI  reference  model  and  TCP/IP  model  define  how  these  layers  works  and  manages  the 
traffic.  
 
C. Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems 
Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) is the way of intrusion detection in a distributed 
environment such as grid and cloud computing [19]. All the components in the distributed area 
communicate each other with an agent-based approach. There are three fundamental components 
and  assignments  are  similar  to  other  types  of  IDSs’  components.  Main  subject  in  DIDSs  deal 
whole system like a traditional network or host [20]. DIDS components do not have a worldwide 
accepted standard, but there are network and host based sensor components, detection engine and 
management component. 
 
D. Network Behavior Analysis Intrusion Detection 
Network Behavior Analysis Intrusion Detection (NBAD) is an intrusion detection methodology 
which is providing to decide if the network traffic is suspicious or not by the statistical data and

Abstract—Cloud  computing  provides  flexible  on  demand  services  to  the  end  users  with  lesser  infrastructural 
investment. Under the supervision of different managements, these services are provided over the Internet using 
known  networking  protocols,  standards  and  formats.  Existing  deficiencies  in  underlying  technologies  tend  to 
open doors for intrusion. This paper surveys different intrusions affecting basics of cloud security i.e. availability, 
confidentiality  and  integrity  of  Cloud  resources  and  services.  It  examines  proposals  incorporating  Intrusion 
Detection Systems (IDS) in Cloud and discusses various types and techniques of IDS.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Goal of Cloud  computing  is to provide convenient, on-demand  network access to a computing 
resources. Cloud provides services in various forms: Software as a Service-SaaS, Platform as a 
Service-  PaaS  and  Infrastructure  as  Service-IaaS[6].  In  this  world  of  Internet,  security  and 
privacy  of  Cloud  services  are  key  issues.  Data  security  is  the  greatest  challenge  of  Cloud 
computing and after that intrusion detection in cloud infrastructures. Cloud infrastructure makes 
use  of  virtualization  techniques,  integrated  technologies  and  runs  through  standard  Internet 
protocols[19].  These  may  attract  intruders  due  to  much  vulnerability  involved  in  it.  Cloud 
computing also suffers from various traditional attacks such as IP spoofing, Routing information 
Protocol  attack,  Flooding,  Denial  of  Service  (DoS),  Distributed  Denial  of  Service  (DDoS)  etc. 
Firewall  can  be  a  good  option  to  prevent  outside  attacks  but  does  not  work  for  insider 
attacks[12].  Efficient  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS)  should  be  incorporated  in  Cloud 
infrastructure. Rest of the paper is organized as follows.

II. INTRUSIONS TO CLOUD SYSTEMS 
This  section  illustrates  several  common  attacks  (intrusions),  which  causes  availability, 
confidentiality and integrity issues to Cloud resources and services.  
 
A. Insider attack 
The person who could access the whole information system with privileged authority are defined 
as  insider.  Insider  attacks  are  organized  and  performed  by  these  individuals  to  destroy  or 
manipulate the knowledge about system or providers and include every kind of attacks which can 
possibly  be  executed  from  inside[11].  Authorized  Cloud  users  may  attempt  to  misuse 
unauthorized  privileges.  Insiders  may  commit  frauds  and  destroy  information  or  they  may 
disclose information to others. This poses a serious trust issue[6].  
 
B. Flooding attack 
In  this  type  of  attack,  attackers  can  send  very  large  amounts  of  packets  from  exploited 
information resources, and they are called as zombie (innocent host) [11]. Here, attacker tries to 
flood  victim  by  sending  huge  number  of  packets  from  innocent  host  (zombies)  in  network.  
Packets  can  be  either  one  of  TCP,  ICMP,  UDP  or  a  mix  of  these  protocols.  These  kinds  of 
attacks are mostly realized over unauthorized network connections. Because of cloud computing 
paradigms’ nature, connections to the virtual machines are established everywhere over Internet. 
For this reason, exposition of cloud users with Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) attacks are inevitable[8]. Flooding attacks affect the availability of serviced for 
authorized  users.  An  attack  that  is  realized  to  a  server  which  serves  one  kind  of  service  can 
prevent a vast of scale accessibility to this served service. These kinds of attacks are called DoS 
attacks. If servers’ resources are slogged after flooding attacks and  it prevents the execution of 
other services, which run on the server, this kind of attacks are called indirect DoS attacks[6]. 
 
C. User to Root attacks 
In this type of attack, an intruder seizes the account and password information of an authorized 
user,  and  he  can  acquire  limitless  access  to  the  whole  system  [11].  This  makes  him  able  to 
exploit vulnerabilities for gaining root level access to system For example; Buffer overflows are 
used  to  generate  root  shells  from  a  process  running  as  root.  Buffer  overflows  are  used  for 
establish console connection for authorized processes. This type of intrusion can be realized with 
writing an excessive amount of data to a statically defined buffers’ capacity, and the information 
is  captured  by  intruders  from  this  overflowed  data.  An  attacker  who  owned  the  account  and 
password information of an authorized user can hold the access privilege to servers and also to 
virtual machines[12].  
 
D. Port Scanning 
An attack that identifies open, closed and filtered ports on a system [11]. Through port scanning, 
attackers  can  find  open  ports  and  attack  on  services  running  on  these  ports.  Network  related

Ashish Kumbhare et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.4, April- 2014, pg. 497-502 

details  such  as  IP  address,  MAC  address,  router,  gateway  filtering,  firewall  rules  etc.  can  be 
known through this attack. Various port scanning techniques are TCP scanning, UDP scanning, 
SYN  scanning,  FIN  scanning,  ACK  scanning,  Window  scanning  (same  as  ACK  scan  but  it 
checks  any  modifications  in  the  window  field  of  packet)  etc.    Port  scanning  is  not  used  by  its 
own, an intruder realize the actual attack after getting information about open ports and running 
services. 
 
E. Attacks on Virtual Machine (VM) or hypervisor 
After compromising  hypervisor, control of the  virtual  machines  in the  virtual  environment will 
be captured [11]. Zero day  attacks are one of the  methods that attack virtual  machines and use 
hypervisor or other virtual machines to attack other virtual machines.  A zeroday vulnerability is 
a threat that tries to exploit application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or the software 
developer.  Zero  day  attacks  use  known  vulnerabilities  before  system  or  software  developers 
apply  patches  or  updates.  Multiple  virtual  machines  use  the  same  resource  pool,  especially 
hardware and with this kind of access side channel data has a chance to be captured, which flow 
one  virtual  machine  to  other  [12].  A  zero-day  vulnerability  was  exploited  in  the  HyperVM 
virtualization  application  which  resulted  in  destruction  of  many  virtual  server  based  websites 
[17]. 
 
F. Backdoor channel attacks 
It is a passive attack which allows hackers to gain remote access to the infected node in order to 
compromise  user  confidentiality.  Using  backdoor  channels,  hackers  can  control  victim’s 
resources and can make it as zombie to attempt DDoS attack[9]. It can also be used to disclose 
the confidential data of victim. Due to this, compromised system faces difficulty in performing 
its  regular  tasks.  In  Cloud  environment,  attacker  can  get  access  and  control  Cloud  user’s 
resources through backdoor channel and make VM as  Zombie to initiate DoS/DDoS attack. For 
insider  attacks,  signature  based  intrusion  detection  solutions  can  normally  be  used[20].  To 
prevent  attacks  on  VM/Hypervisor,  anomaly  based  intrusion  detection  techniques  can  be  used. 
For  flooding  attack  and  backdoor  channel  attack,  either  signature  based  intrusion  detection  or 
anomaly based intrusion detection techniques can be used[18]. Firewall (in Cloud) could be the 
common solution to prevent some of the attacks listed above.

(IDSs)  are  one  of  the  practical  solutions  to  resist  these  attacks.  IDSs  are  systems  that  realize

formal situation of network traffic[5]. Sensors detect DoS attacks with the help of to be aware of 
the  network  traffic  and  unexpected  application  services  and  rule  violations  by  scanning  the 
network[8].  Traditional  NIDSs  and  NBAD  systems  share  some  common  components  like 
sensors and  management consoles,  but NBAD systems generally do not have database  servers, 
unlike  the  traditional  NIDSs.  NBAD  systems  work  to  decide  in  the  case  of  unexpected  data 
traffic. It is generally efficient to detect DoS attacks and worms [1]. 
 

IV. CONCLUSION 

The use of Cloud computing will reduce the infrastructure maintenance cost, scalability for data 
and  applications,  availability  of  data  services  and  pay  as  you  use  features.  Consequently,  the 
probability  of  having  various  types  of  vulnerabilities  causing  attacks  is  high.  This  survey, 
discussed several intrusions which can threat integrity, confidentiality and availability of Cloud 
services  in the  future. One of the existing  solutions  viz.  firewall  may  not be sufficient to solve 
Cloud  security  issues.  The  paper  emphasized  the  usage  of  alternative  options  to  incorporate 
intrusion detection techniques into Cloud.

attacks. If servers’ resources are slogged after flooding attacks and  it prevents the execution of 
other services, which run on the server, this kind of attacks are called indirect DoS attacks[6]. 
 
C. User to Root attacks 
In this type of attack, an intruder seizes the account and password information of an authorized 
user,  and  he  can  acquire  limitless  access  to  the  whole  system  [11].  This  makes  him  able  to 
exploit vulnerabilities for gaining root level access to system For example; Buffer overflows are 
used  to  generate  root  shells  from  a  process  running  as  root.  Buffer  overflows  are  used  for 
establish console connection for authorized processes. This type of intrusion can be realized with 
writing an excessive amount of data to a statically defined buffers’ capacity, and the information 
is  captured  by  intruders  from  this  overflowed  data.  An  attacker  who  owned  the  account  and 
password information of an authorized user can hold the access privilege to servers and also to 
virtual machines[12].  
 
D. Port Scanning 
An attack that identifies open, closed and filtered ports on a system [11]. Through port scanning, 
attackers  can  find  open  ports  and  attack  on  services  running  on  these  ports.  Network  related

details  such  as  IP  address,  MAC  address,  router,  gateway  filtering,  firewall  rules  etc.  can  be 
known through this attack. Various port scanning techniques are TCP scanning, UDP scanning, 
SYN  scanning,  FIN  scanning,  ACK  scanning,  Window  scanning  (same  as  ACK  scan  but  it 
checks  any  modifications  in  the  window  field  of  packet)  etc.    Port  scanning  is  not  used  by  its 
own, an intruder realize the actual attack after getting information about open ports and running 
services. 
 
E. Attacks on Virtual Machine (VM) or hypervisor 
After compromising  hypervisor, control of the  virtual  machines  in the  virtual  environment will 
be captured [11]. Zero day  attacks are one of the  methods that attack virtual  machines and use 
hypervisor or other virtual machines to attack other virtual machines.  A zeroday vulnerability is 
a threat that tries to exploit application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or the software 
developer.  Zero  day  attacks  use  known  vulnerabilities  before  system  or  software  developers 
apply  patches  or  updates.  Multiple  virtual  machines  use  the  same  resource  pool,  especially 
hardware and with this kind of access side channel data has a chance to be captured, which flow 
one  virtual  machine  to  other  [12].  A  zero-day  vulnerability  was  exploited  in  the  HyperVM 
virtualization  application  which  resulted  in  destruction  of  many  virtual  server  based  websites 
[17]. 
 
F. Backdoor channel attacks 
It is a passive attack which allows hackers to gain remote access to the infected node in order to 
compromise  user  confidentiality.  Using  backdoor  channels,  hackers  can  control  victim’s 
resources and can make it as zombie to attempt DDoS attack[9]. It can also be used to disclose 
the confidential data of victim. Due to this, compromised system faces difficulty in performing 
its  regular  tasks.  In  Cloud  environment,  attacker  can  get  access  and  control  Cloud  user’s 
resources through backdoor channel and make VM as  Zombie to initiate DoS/DDoS attack. For 
insider  attacks,  signature  based  intrusion  detection  solutions  can  normally  be  used[20].  To 
prevent  attacks  on  VM/Hypervisor,  anomaly  based  intrusion  detection  techniques  can  be  used. 
For  flooding  attack  and  backdoor  channel  attack,  either  signature  based  intrusion  detection  or 
anomaly based intrusion detection techniques can be used[18]. Firewall (in Cloud) could be the 
common solution to prevent some of the attacks listed above. 
  
III. INTRUSION DETECTION IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
As detailed in previous section, there are different types of attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems 
(IDSs)  are  one  of  the  practical  solutions  to  resist  these  attacks.  IDSs  are  systems  that  realize 
intrusion  detection,  log  detected  information,  alert  or  perform  predefined  procedures  [17,  18]. 
They  can  be  either  hardware  or  software  that  includes  whole  observed  computing  entities. 
Mainly there are three types of IDS in cloud computing systems: Host based IDS, Network based 
IDS, and Distributed IDS.

A. Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems 
Host-based  Intrusion  Detection  System  was  the  first  type  of  intrusion  detection  software  to  be 
designed,  with  the  original  target  system  being  the  mainframe  computer  where  outside 
interaction was infrequent [6]. Host-based IDSs operate on information collected from within an 
individual computer system. A Host-based IDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from 
the  computer  system  only  and  would  alert  the  user  or  administrator  if  suspicious  activity  is 
detected [5][1].  Host Based IDSs analyze the suspicious activities like system call, processes or 
thread, asset and configuration access by observing the situation of host. It is especially used to 
protect valuable and private information on server systems. HIDS is composed of sensors located 
on servers or workstations which  are  made to prevent the attacks to a host[1]. An HIDS  is  not 
just monitor network traffic, it can also trace more and settle with local settings of an OS and log 
records. 
 

B. Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems 
Network-based  Intrusion  Detection  Systems  focus  more  greatly  on  the  network than  a  specific 
host. Network-based IDS detects attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets. Listening 
on  a  network  segment  or  switch,  one  network-based  IDS  can  monitor  the  network  traffic 
affecting  multiple  hosts  that  are  connected  to  the  network  segment,  thereby  protecting  those 
hosts[13]. Network-based IDSs often consist of a set of single purpose sensors placed at various 
points  in  a  network.  Network-based  IDSs  (NIDS)  observe,  monitor  and  analyses  the  specified 
and pre-identified network traffic. It can detect different situations based on specified points and 
generally  located  between  the  end  point  devices  like  routers,  firewalls[1][13].  A  NIDS  is  an 
intrusion  detection  system  that  attempts  to  discover  unauthorized  access  to  a  network  by 
analyzing  traffic  on  the  network  for  signs  of  malicious  activities  and  events.  Network  traffic 
stacks on different layers and every layer delivers the data coming from a layer to another layer 
[1].  OSI  reference  model  and  TCP/IP  model  define  how  these  layers  works  and  manages  the 
traffic.  
 
C. Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems 
Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) is the way of intrusion detection in a distributed 
environment such as grid and cloud computing [19]. All the components in the distributed area 
communicate each other with an agent-based approach. There are three fundamental components 
and  assignments  are  similar  to  other  types  of  IDSs’  components.  Main  subject  in  DIDSs  deal 
whole system like a traditional network or host [20]. DIDS components do not have a worldwide 
accepted standard, but there are network and host based sensor components, detection engine and 
management component. 
 
D. Network Behavior Analysis Intrusion Detection 
Network Behavior Analysis Intrusion Detection (NBAD) is an intrusion detection methodology 
which is providing to decide if the network traffic is suspicious or not by the statistical data and

formal situation of network traffic[5]. Sensors detect DoS attacks with the help of to be aware of 
the  network  traffic  and  unexpected  application  services  and  rule  violations  by  scanning  the 
network[8].  Traditional  NIDSs  and  NBAD  systems  share  some  common  components  like 
sensors and  management consoles,  but NBAD systems generally do not have database  servers, 
unlike  the  traditional  NIDSs.  NBAD  systems  work  to  decide  in  the  case  of  unexpected  data 
traffic. It is generally efficient to detect DoS attacks and worms [1]. 
 

IV. CONCLUSION 

The use of Cloud computing will reduce the infrastructure maintenance cost, scalability for data 
and  applications,  availability  of  data  services  and  pay  as  you  use  features.  Consequently,  the 
probability  of  having  various  types  of  vulnerabilities  causing  attacks  is  high.  This  survey, 
discussed several intrusions which can threat integrity, confidentiality and availability of Cloud 
services  in the  future. One of the existing  solutions  viz.  firewall  may  not be sufficient to solve 
Cloud  security  issues.  The  paper  emphasized  the  usage  of  alternative  options  to  incorporate 
intrusion detection techniques into Cloud.
