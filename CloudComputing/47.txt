I. INTRODUCTION  

Recently,  cloud  computing  has  gained  a  considerable  acceptance  as  a  promising  model  from  both  business  and  academic 
communities.  It  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with 
minimal management effort or service provider interaction [1]. It provides resources as a part of service using internet technology. 
Cloud  computing  allows  tenants  to  store  programs  or  documents  stored  individually  in  large-scale  computer  to  which  can  be 
accessed anytime and anywhere, and to perform necessary works through various terminal units including PCs or mobile phones. In 
cloud  computing  environment  tenants  borrows  and  uses  cloud  resources as  required  and  pays  the  expenses as  used.  Most  large-
sized  organizations  have  enough  investment  strength  and  high  technical  skills  to  build  private  cloud  for  the  reason  of  security. 
However,  small  and  medium-sized  organizations  lack  capital  compared  with  large-sized  organizations  and  so  they  tend  to  use 
public  cloud  with  lower  initial  capital  and  operation  costs  compared  with  private  cloud.  Additionally,  the  cloud  computing 
technology comes with several problems and various security issues [2,3]. 

So  far,  schemes  have  been  proposed,  to  provide  adequate  security  to  cloud  computing  [4].  However,  these  existing  security 
schemes lack security measures. The major issue consists of multi-tenancy, packet transmission, storing and encrypting user’s data, 
application security, cloud integrity and  security related to third-party [3,6]. Moreover, the openness nature of internet has many 
security flaws. Therefore, attackers can misuse these flaws [5] to disturb various services using various kinds of attacks and threats. 
In cloud computing, few good quality papers have been presented on tenant authentication but scope of the survey paper still 
differs  from  existing  works  in  different  aspects.  We  have  gone  through  various  surveys  but  no  review  paper  is  available  where 
recent authentication schemes of cloud are discussed. The goal of this study is to provide detailed view of authentication schemes 
for  cloud  computing  and  to  identify  research  direction  for  future  work.  The  rest  of  the paper  is organized as  follows.  Section II 
presents  the  parameters  used  to  evaluate  different  authentication  schemes.  Section  III  deals  with  actual  survey  of  different 
authentication schemes for cloud that have been presented and published. Section IV concludes our survey. 

 

II. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

In  general  authentication  is  the  act  of  validating  someone  as  authentic  and  claims  they  made  are  true.  In  cloud  computing, 
validation  is  generally  done  using  the  login  username  and  password.  Knowledge  of  the  password  is  adopted  to  ensure  that  the 
tenant is authentic. Each tenant registers first or gets registered by someone else on cloud server and using an assigned or self-stated 
password. During each successive use, the tenant must know and use the already declared password. The weakness of this system is 
that  passwords  can  often  be  stolen,  unintentionally  revealed  or  forgotten.  There  are  a  couple  of  possible  authentication  attacks

III. SURVEY OF EXISTING SCHEMES IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

In this section, we will review some existing authentication schemes which are based on client-server architecture. One of the 
most popular and elderly remote user scheme was suggested by Lamport [7] in 1981, in which, the server stores the hashed value of 
a user’s password. In Lamport's scheme, password table utilized to confirm the authenticity of users, but if this password table is 
compromised, stolen, or altered by an adversary, then the system could be in part or totally compromised.  

In  [8],  authors  proposed  a  method  which  uses  Two  Factor  Authentication  (2FA)  where  first  the  tenant  gets  verified  by  a 
password and smart card and then is authenticated by Out Of Band (OOB) authentication. Drawback of this work is smart card as 
login is prone to get stolen. For the messages sent from A to S are only related with secret data stored in the smartcard, the attacker 
can  impersonate  as  a  legal  tenant.  The  attacker  can  compute  intermediate  values.  Therefore,  the  messages  in  login  phase 
authentication phase can be generated by the attacker so that the attacker can successfully create a valid login request as a legal 
tenant.  Moreover,  this  method  uses  One  Time  Passwords  (OTP)/OOB  that  is  prone  to  phishing  attacks  [9]  and  clock  has  to  be 
synchronized from time to time with the server. 

The stolen-verifier attack works by stealing the password file. People fight this attack by saving hashed or encrypted password 
in the server. However, this solution is vulnerable to other attacks, as the tenant is still required to enter a password. The plain-text 
password  traveling  through  the  network  can  be  intercepted  by  a  third  party  [10],  which  called  the  man-in-the-middle  attack.  A 
countermeasure against the man-in-the-middle attack is to hash or encrypt the password before it is sent to network. However, this 
does not prevent the replay attack, which captures the encrypted password and uses it to intrude into the system. 

Tenants are also authenticated using graphical passwords. The algorithm works as the tenant is made to select one image from 
multiple  images  and  then  tenant  draws  a  correct  pattern  to  get  authenticated  [11].  This  algorithm  is  prone  to  shoulder  surfing 
attacks. Another problem is the images are stored locally so if the device crashes, authentication would not be possible.  

Some algorithms use biometric values as input to authenticate a  tenant but despite all the benefits as a password technology, 
there  are  still  some  challenges.  This  technology  cannot  guarantee  100%  correct  identification  [12].  Additionally,  the 
implementation  cost  also  increases  as  it  needs  hardware  for  taking  biometric  input.  Another  method  proposed  in  [15]  verifies  a 
tenant  is  using  Elliptic  Curve  Cryptography  (ECC)  where  an  elliptical  curve  equation  with  order  n  and  selects  a  base  point  and 
generates  pair  of  private  public  keys.  The  size  of  the  curve  ascertains  the  complexity  of  the  problem.  One  of  the  fundamental

demerits of ECC is that it expands the size of the encrypted message significantly more than RSA encryption. Moreover, the ECC 
algorithm  is  more  complex  and  more difficult  to  implement  than  RSA,  which  expands  the  probability  of  implementation  errors, 
thereby decreasing the security of the algorithm. 

One  time  passwords  are  generated  from  algorithms.  They  are  different  from  typical  algorithms  as  they  generate  random 
passwords and do not repeat themselves. Every new password generated is unique from the previously generated ones. The main 
element of this algorithm is the seed value that is shared between the user and the server. During the authentication process, both 
user and server both individually generate OTPs and the  user OTP is sent to server for verification. Server then verifies its own 
OTP with the user OTP. If both OTPs match, the tenant is authenticated. A software developer can use algorithms to generate one-
time passwords. The password generating software can be embedded in hardware or Java Smart cards, USB dongles, and mobile 
phones can run the password generating software to generate one-time passwords. 

One time password can be generated in any of the two ways, HMAC based One Time Passwords (HOTP) [13] and Time based 
One  Time  Passwords  (TOTP)  [8,  14].  In  HOTP,  both  the  user  and  server  will  typically  have  an  identical  initial  seed  (counter 
value).  User  generates  a  one-time  password  from  the  initial  seed  and  any  other  input  (PIN)  and  updates  the  seed  (increment/ 
decrement the counter). Tenant submits the generated one-time password to server. Server likewise generates the password for that 
instance utilizing the seed and different inputs. If both passwords match, the server authenticates the  tenant and updates the seed 
(increment/ decrement the counter). In TOTP, both the user and server will have synchronous time clocks and use an algorithm that 
generates  one-time  password  from  the  synchronous  time  and  any  other  inputs  (PIN).  User  generates  a  one-time  password  and 
submits  it  to  server.  Server  also  generates  a  one-time  password  for  that  tenant  for  that  instance  of  time  and  verifies  it  with  the 
password received from user. As the clocks on user and server tend to drift over a period of time, maintaining time synchronization 
is a major challenge in this method. The main problem with the OTPs is the phishing attack. Common phishing attacks always lead 
the tenant to a fake web site whose look-and-feel is identical to legitimate one. The tenant generates the OTP and sends it to the 
fake website controlled by the attacker, which can now use this password to login to the real web site. Another problem with OTPs 
is if the seed value is compromised, the passwords can be generated by attacker and can impersonate the  tenant to gain access to 
cloud resources. 

Another 2FA method proposed in [16] authenticates the tenant using zero knowledge proof. First the tenant is verified using the 
username and password and the second factor is the credential file which is stored on  tenant’s USB or phone. The benefit of this 
scheme  is  the  password  need  not  be  stored  on  the  cloud  server.  This  assures  tenant  from  third  party  cloud  service  providers. 
However, this scheme would not allow the tenants to access the cloud resources if the credential file is lost or stolen. 

In  [17],  author  has  proposed  a  scheme  where  tenant  inserts  smart  card  into  the  card  reader  and  enters  password  as  well  as 
identifier.  Tenant  side  generates  a  random  value  is  generated  using  which  is  nonce  and  few  variables  are  computed  and  sent  to 
server. Upon receiving response from tenant, server checks upon the values to authenticate tenant. But this scheme is vulnerable to 
phishing attack and if the smart card is stolen, it would be impossible for tenant to get the access of cloud’s resources. 

Table  II  shows  the  comparative  analysis  of  some  of  the  authentication  schemes  implemented  in  cloud.  These  schemes  are 
compared  on  the  basis  of  resistance  to  various  attacks  mentioned  in  Section  II.  Other  comparison  parameters  are  identity 
management, password changing phase, anonymity, computational cost, etc.

We  have  so  far  discussed  various  authentication  schemes  for  cloud  computing.  With  wide  variety  of  applications  of  cloud 
computing,  security is one of the  major  issues. Authenticating cloud users is gaining more attention.  Diverse schemes have been 
proposed in literature, some of which we have stated in our survey. From our observations, we conclude that the reviewed cloud 
authentication  schemes  lack  resistance  to  some  or  the  other  attacks.  However  none  of  the  scheme  fulfills  all  the  criteria  of  the 
evaluation.  So  using  this  work  one  can  get  encouragement  to  develop  new  scheme  that  may  satisfy  the  all  the  criteria  of  the

Abstract—Cloud  computing  has  changed  the  corporate  as  well  as  educational  industry  ever  since  it  evolved.  Cloud 
computing is basically convenient, cost effective and on demand service offered to the clients. This can, for instance, lead 
to cost reserve funds, better resource usage and removing the need of specialized technical skill for the tenants. There are 
huge security concerns when utilizing cloud services. Security is extremely vital in cloud computing since individuals and 
organizations  store  private  information  in  the  cloud.  It  should  likewise  be  not  difficult  to  utilize  the  services  provided, 
since cloud service providers have such a large number of tenants with diverse specialized background. Since the control 
of  services  and  information  required  for  the  regular  run  of  a  organization  is  handled  by  third  party  providers,  tenants 
needs to believe the  third party cloud service provider, and  trust that they handle their information in a right way, and 
resources are available as and when needed. Many approaches for authentication in cloud services  have been proposed. 
They are either insecure, intricate or highly expensive. In this work we have carried of the comparative study of different 
authentication schemes in cloud computing finally summarize on the basis of different evaluation criteria.

I. INTRODUCTION  

Recently,  cloud  computing  has  gained  a  considerable  acceptance  as  a  promising  model  from  both  business  and  academic 
communities.  It  is  a  model  for  enabling  ubiquitous,  convenient,  on-demand  network  access  to  a  shared  pool  of  configurable 
computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with 
minimal management effort or service provider interaction [1]. It provides resources as a part of service using internet technology. 
Cloud  computing  allows  tenants  to  store  programs  or  documents  stored  individually  in  large-scale  computer  to  which  can  be 
accessed anytime and anywhere, and to perform necessary works through various terminal units including PCs or mobile phones. In 
cloud  computing  environment  tenants  borrows  and  uses  cloud  resources as  required  and  pays  the  expenses as  used.  Most  large-
sized  organizations  have  enough  investment  strength  and  high  technical  skills  to  build  private  cloud  for  the  reason  of  security. 
However,  small  and  medium-sized  organizations  lack  capital  compared  with  large-sized  organizations  and  so  they  tend  to  use 
public  cloud  with  lower  initial  capital  and  operation  costs  compared  with  private  cloud.  Additionally,  the  cloud  computing 
technology comes with several problems and various security issues [2,3]. 

So  far,  schemes  have  been  proposed,  to  provide  adequate  security  to  cloud  computing  [4].  However,  these  existing  security 
schemes lack security measures. The major issue consists of multi-tenancy, packet transmission, storing and encrypting user’s data, 
application security, cloud integrity and  security related to third-party [3,6]. Moreover, the openness nature of internet has many 
security flaws. Therefore, attackers can misuse these flaws [5] to disturb various services using various kinds of attacks and threats. 
In cloud computing, few good quality papers have been presented on tenant authentication but scope of the survey paper still 
differs  from  existing  works  in  different  aspects.  We  have  gone  through  various  surveys  but  no  review  paper  is  available  where 
recent authentication schemes of cloud are discussed. The goal of this study is to provide detailed view of authentication schemes 
for  cloud  computing  and  to  identify  research  direction  for  future  work.  The  rest  of  the paper  is organized as  follows.  Section II 
presents  the  parameters  used  to  evaluate  different  authentication  schemes.  Section  III  deals  with  actual  survey  of  different 
authentication schemes for cloud that have been presented and published. Section IV concludes our survey. 

 

II. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

In  general  authentication  is  the  act  of  validating  someone  as  authentic  and  claims  they  made  are  true.  In  cloud  computing, 
validation  is  generally  done  using  the  login  username  and  password.  Knowledge  of  the  password  is  adopted  to  ensure  that  the 
tenant is authentic. Each tenant registers first or gets registered by someone else on cloud server and using an assigned or self-stated 
password. During each successive use, the tenant must know and use the already declared password. The weakness of this system is 
that  passwords  can  often  be  stolen,  unintentionally  revealed  or  forgotten.  There  are  a  couple  of  possible  authentication  attacks 
describing in Table I.

Insider assisted attack 
 
Phishing attack 
 
Shoulder-surfing attack 
 

This  includes  multiple  attacks,  including  brute  force,  common  passwords  and  dictionary  attacks, 
which aim to obtain password of the user. The attacker can try to guess a specific user’s password, 
try common passwords to all users or use an already made list of passwords to match against the 
password file, in their attempt to find a valid password.  

The  attacker  tracks  the  authentication  packet  and  replays  this  information  to  get  an  unauthorized 
access to the server.  

The  attacker  passively  puts  himself  in  between  the  user  and  the  verifier  in  an  authentication 
process.  The  attacker  then  attempts  to  authenticate  by  pretending  to be  as the  user  to  the  verifier 
and the verifier to the user 

The attacker pretends to be the verifier to the user to obtain authentication keys or data that may be 
used to authenticate fallaciously to the verifier. 

The systems managers intentionally compromise the authentication system or thieve authentication 
keys or relevant data of users.  

Social engineering attacks that use fake emails, web pages and other electronic communications to 
encourage the user to disclose their password and other susceptible information to the attacker.  

Social  engineering  attacks  definite  to  password  systems  where  the  attacker  secretly  directs 
observing the password when the user enters it.  

 
A  number  of  the  security  frameworks  presented  in  the  survey  deal  with  security  flaws  or  high  computational  cost.  The

III. SURVEY OF EXISTING SCHEMES IN CLOUD COMPUTING 

In this section, we will review some existing authentication schemes which are based on client-server architecture. One of the 
most popular and elderly remote user scheme was suggested by Lamport [7] in 1981, in which, the server stores the hashed value of 
a user’s password. In Lamport's scheme, password table utilized to confirm the authenticity of users, but if this password table is 
compromised, stolen, or altered by an adversary, then the system could be in part or totally compromised.  

In  [8],  authors  proposed  a  method  which  uses  Two  Factor  Authentication  (2FA)  where  first  the  tenant  gets  verified  by  a 
password and smart card and then is authenticated by Out Of Band (OOB) authentication. Drawback of this work is smart card as 
login is prone to get stolen. For the messages sent from A to S are only related with secret data stored in the smartcard, the attacker 
can  impersonate  as  a  legal  tenant.  The  attacker  can  compute  intermediate  values.  Therefore,  the  messages  in  login  phase 
authentication phase can be generated by the attacker so that the attacker can successfully create a valid login request as a legal 
tenant.  Moreover,  this  method  uses  One  Time  Passwords  (OTP)/OOB  that  is  prone  to  phishing  attacks  [9]  and  clock  has  to  be 
synchronized from time to time with the server. 

The stolen-verifier attack works by stealing the password file. People fight this attack by saving hashed or encrypted password 
in the server. However, this solution is vulnerable to other attacks, as the tenant is still required to enter a password. The plain-text 
password  traveling  through  the  network  can  be  intercepted  by  a  third  party  [10],  which  called  the  man-in-the-middle  attack.  A 
countermeasure against the man-in-the-middle attack is to hash or encrypt the password before it is sent to network. However, this 
does not prevent the replay attack, which captures the encrypted password and uses it to intrude into the system. 

Tenants are also authenticated using graphical passwords. The algorithm works as the tenant is made to select one image from 
multiple  images  and  then  tenant  draws  a  correct  pattern  to  get  authenticated  [11].  This  algorithm  is  prone  to  shoulder  surfing 
attacks. Another problem is the images are stored locally so if the device crashes, authentication would not be possible.  

Some algorithms use biometric values as input to authenticate a  tenant but despite all the benefits as a password technology, 
there  are  still  some  challenges.  This  technology  cannot  guarantee  100%  correct  identification  [12].  Additionally,  the 
implementation  cost  also  increases  as  it  needs  hardware  for  taking  biometric  input.  Another  method  proposed  in  [15]  verifies  a 
tenant  is  using  Elliptic  Curve  Cryptography  (ECC)  where  an  elliptical  curve  equation  with  order  n  and  selects  a  base  point  and 
generates  pair  of  private  public  keys.  The  size  of  the  curve  ascertains  the  complexity  of  the  problem.  One  of  the  fundamental

demerits of ECC is that it expands the size of the encrypted message significantly more than RSA encryption. Moreover, the ECC 
algorithm  is  more  complex  and  more difficult  to  implement  than  RSA,  which  expands  the  probability  of  implementation  errors, 
thereby decreasing the security of the algorithm. 

One  time  passwords  are  generated  from  algorithms.  They  are  different  from  typical  algorithms  as  they  generate  random 
passwords and do not repeat themselves. Every new password generated is unique from the previously generated ones. The main 
element of this algorithm is the seed value that is shared between the user and the server. During the authentication process, both 
user and server both individually generate OTPs and the  user OTP is sent to server for verification. Server then verifies its own 
OTP with the user OTP. If both OTPs match, the tenant is authenticated. A software developer can use algorithms to generate one-
time passwords. The password generating software can be embedded in hardware or Java Smart cards, USB dongles, and mobile 
phones can run the password generating software to generate one-time passwords. 

One time password can be generated in any of the two ways, HMAC based One Time Passwords (HOTP) [13] and Time based 
One  Time  Passwords  (TOTP)  [8,  14].  In  HOTP,  both  the  user  and  server  will  typically  have  an  identical  initial  seed  (counter 
value).  User  generates  a  one-time  password  from  the  initial  seed  and  any  other  input  (PIN)  and  updates  the  seed  (increment/ 
decrement the counter). Tenant submits the generated one-time password to server. Server likewise generates the password for that 
instance utilizing the seed and different inputs. If both passwords match, the server authenticates the  tenant and updates the seed 
(increment/ decrement the counter). In TOTP, both the user and server will have synchronous time clocks and use an algorithm that 
generates  one-time  password  from  the  synchronous  time  and  any  other  inputs  (PIN).  User  generates  a  one-time  password  and 
submits  it  to  server.  Server  also  generates  a  one-time  password  for  that  tenant  for  that  instance  of  time  and  verifies  it  with  the 
password received from user. As the clocks on user and server tend to drift over a period of time, maintaining time synchronization 
is a major challenge in this method. The main problem with the OTPs is the phishing attack. Common phishing attacks always lead 
the tenant to a fake web site whose look-and-feel is identical to legitimate one. The tenant generates the OTP and sends it to the 
fake website controlled by the attacker, which can now use this password to login to the real web site. Another problem with OTPs 
is if the seed value is compromised, the passwords can be generated by attacker and can impersonate the  tenant to gain access to 
cloud resources. 

Another 2FA method proposed in [16] authenticates the tenant using zero knowledge proof. First the tenant is verified using the 
username and password and the second factor is the credential file which is stored on  tenant’s USB or phone. The benefit of this 
scheme  is  the  password  need  not  be  stored  on  the  cloud  server.  This  assures  tenant  from  third  party  cloud  service  providers. 
However, this scheme would not allow the tenants to access the cloud resources if the credential file is lost or stolen. 

In  [17],  author  has  proposed  a  scheme  where  tenant  inserts  smart  card  into  the  card  reader  and  enters  password  as  well  as 
identifier.  Tenant  side  generates  a  random  value  is  generated  using  which  is  nonce  and  few  variables  are  computed  and  sent  to 
server. Upon receiving response from tenant, server checks upon the values to authenticate tenant. But this scheme is vulnerable to 
phishing attack and if the smart card is stolen, it would be impossible for tenant to get the access of cloud’s resources. 

Table  II  shows  the  comparative  analysis  of  some  of  the  authentication  schemes  implemented  in  cloud.  These  schemes  are 
compared  on  the  basis  of  resistance  to  various  attacks  mentioned  in  Section  II.  Other  comparison  parameters  are  identity 
management, password changing phase, anonymity, computational cost, etc.
