Abstract 
 
Mobility among the masses is now in vogue. In the years to come, work in cloud clouding computing is expected to reach 
greater  heights.  Although,  a new  wave  of  evolution  has broken  shores,  a  vast  expanse  lies  yet  unexplored.  The  mobile 
cloud is Internet-based data, applications and related services accessed through smart phones, laptop computers, tablets 
and  other  portable  devices  .Mobile  cloud  computing  is  differentiated  from  mobile  computing  in  general  because  the 
devices run cloud-based Web apps rather than native apps. Users subscribe to cloud services and access remotely stored 
applications  and  their  associated  data  over  the  Internet.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a  technique,  or  a  model,  which 
allows mobile applications to be built, powered and hosted using cloud computing technology. In this model, the cloud 
performs  the  resource-hungry  activities  such  as  processor-intensive  tasks  and  storing  massive  chunks  of  data. The 
proposed model aims to free mobile devices from performing these tasks; thereby, allowing the devices to run cooler and 
with less power than would have been otherwise required. Using a tailored algorithm to seek out the shortest route to a 
given  cloud  resource  on  the  internet,  this  model  maintains  its  own  database.  When  a  mobile  device  connects  to  the 
internet to seek a cloud based resource, the model identifies  the request and routes it to the shortest path which it has 
kept  track  of  with  the  aid  of  its  constantly  updated  data  table.  This  paper  discusses  the  proposed  model  and  aims  to 
illustrate the manner in which mobile device users would be able to use the cloud application and also take advantage of 
energy savings not only in terms of power consumed, but also most importantly – time.

It 
incorporates  the  elements  of  mobile  networks  and  cloud 
computing, thereby providing optimal services  for  mobile 
users.  In  mobile  cloud  computing,  mobile  devices  do  not 
need  a  powerful  configuration  (e.g.,  CPU  speed  and 
memory  capacity)  since  all  the  data  and  complicated 
computing  modules  can  be  processed  in  the  clouds 
(http://www.smartdevelopments.org;http://www.readwrite

computing  in  combination  with  smart  mobile  devices. 
Cloud  computing  exists  when  tasks  and  data  are  kept  on 
the  internet  rather  than  on  individual  devices,  providing 
on-demand  access  of  data.  Applications  are  run  on  a 
remote  server  and  then  sent  to  user.  Because  of  the 
advanced  improvement  in  mobile  browsers  thanks  to 
Apple  and  Google  over  the  past  couple  of  years,  nearly 
every mobile should have a suitable browser according to 
the need. This means that the developers will have a much 
wider  market  and  they  can  bypass  restrictions  created  by 
mobile  operating  system.  Mobile  cloud  computing  gives 
new company chances for mobile network providers also. 

Several  operators  as  Vodafone,  (Swarnpreet  Singh   et  al, 
2012)  Orange  and  Verizon  have  started  to  offer  cloud 
computing services for different companies. Mobile Cloud 
Computing has three components, mobile device, wireless 
communication  channel  and  cloud.  Mobile  devices  have 
resource  constraint  in  terms  of  battery  power,  memory, 
processing  power  and  have  different  types  of  hardware, 
operating  system,  and  input  -output  interface.  Wireless 
communication  channel  has  different 
radio  access 
technologies such as GPRS, 3G, WLAN and WiMax with 
variable  network  conditions  in  terms  of  limited  and 
unstable  bandwidth.  Cloud  Computing  is  facing  various 
security  and  privacy  challenges.  Security  and  privacy 
issues in mobile cloud computing are inherited from cloud 
computing  and  mobile  computing.  Because  of  resource 
constraints,  heavy  security  algorithm  can’t  be  run  on 
mobile  device.  We  need  to  do  efficient  task  portioning 
between  cloud  and  mobile  to  resolve  the  security  and 
privacy  issues  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (Sapna  Malik 
et  al,  2012).  As  an  inheritance  and  development  of  cloud 
computing, resources in mobile cloud computing networks 
are  virtualized  and  assigned  in  a  group  of  numerous 
distributed  computers  rather  than  in  traditional  local 
computers  or  servers,  and  are  provided  to  mobile  devices

2.1 Client Mode 
 
In this model, mobile device act as client and mobile user 
access service is offered by cloud by thin layer of interface 
web  browser.  Cloud  charges  for  services  till  the  duration 
client  is  connected.  Client  model  depicts  Software  as  a 
Service model of Cloud computing. 
 
2.2  Client / Cloud model 
 
In  client  /cloud  model,  the  concept  of  task  partitioning 
comes  in  which  mobile  users  give  a  part  of  task  to  cloud 
for processing. 
 
2.3  Cloud Model 
  
In  cloud  model,  mobile  device  itself  is  the  part  of  cloud. 
One or more mobile devices create the structure of cloud. 
 
3. Applications of Mobile Cloud Computing 
 
Some  of  the  applications  of  mobile  cloud  computing  are 
Google's  Gmail  drive,  Maps  and  Navigation  systems  for 
Mobile, 
from 
Motorola(with  a  special  feature  called  remote  wipe) 
Amazon  ‘s  new  "cloud-accelerated"  Web  browser  Silk. 
Silk  is  a  "split  browser  whose  software  resides  both  on 
Kindle  Fire  and  EC2.  The  applications  reinforced  by 
mobile  cloud  computing 
include  mobile  commerce, 
mobile  learning,  and  mobile  healthcare  and  other  areas. 
Mobile  applications  extended  extensive  share  in  a  global 
mobile market. Various mobile applications have engaged 
the  recompenses  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  The 
following are the few inferences: 
 
3.1. m-Commerce 
 
Mobile  commerce  (m-commerce)  is  a  buying  and  selling 
of  products  using  mobile  devices.  The  m-commerce 
applications  normally  used  to  achieve  some  tasks  that 
necessitate  mobility 
transactions  and 
payments,  mobile  messaging,  and  mobile  ticketing).  The 
m-commerce 
various 
low  network  bandwidth,  high 
complications 
complexity of mobile device configurations, and security). 
Subsequently,  m-commerce  applications  are  integrated 
into  cloud  computing  environment  to  solve  these  issues 
(X. Yang et al,2010). 
 
3.2. m-Learning 
 
Mobile  learning  (m-learning)  is  an  electronic  learning  (e-
learning)  and  mobility.  However,  traditional  m-learning 
applications  have  limitations  in  terms  of  high  cost  of 
devices  and  network,  low  network  transmission  rate,  and 
limited educational resources (X. Chen et al, 2010; H. Gao 
et  al,  2010;  Jian  Li,  2010).  Cloud  based  m-learning 
applications  are  presented  to  solve  these  limitations,  for 
example  utilizing  a  cloud  with  the  large  storage  capacity 
and  powerful  processing  ability,  the  applications  offer 

learners  with  much  comfortable  services  in  terms  of 
information size, processing speed. 
 
3.3. m-HealthCare 
 
MCC  in  medical  applications  is  used  to  minimize  the 
limitations  of  traditional  medical  treatment  [e.g.,  small 
physical  storage, security and privacy, and  medical errors 
(D. Kopec et al, 2013)]. Mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) 
offers  mobile  users  with  appropriate  help  to  access 
resources  easily.  m-Healthcare  provides  healthcare 
organizations a diversity of on-demand services on clouds 
rather than standalone applications on local servers. 
 
3.4. m-Banking 
 
M-Banking  is  an  uprising  in  traditional  banking  services, 
where  user  can  avail  the  bank  services  provided  to  them 
through their mobile despite of location and time (Z. Li et 
al, 2001). Transaction can be done even if user is busy in 
his  routine  work  via  SMS  or  the  mobile  Internet  but  can 
also  use  special  programs,  called  mobile  applications, 
downloaded to the mobile device. 
 
3.5. m-Game 
 
Mobile game (m-game) is a prospective market producing 
incomes  for  service  providers.  M-game  can  completely 
offload  game  engine  requiring  large  computing  resource 
(e.g.,  graphic  rendering)  to  the  server  in  the  cloud,  and 
gamers  only  interact  with  the  screen  interface  on  their  
devices  (Jasleen  et  al,  2013) demonstrates  that  offloading 
(multimedia  code)  can  save  energy  for  mobile  devices, 
thereby increasing game playing time on mobile devices. 
 
4. Data Security Issues in the Mobile cloud 
 
4.1. Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Once the client host data to the cloud there should be some 
guarantee  that  access  to  that  data  will  only  be  limited  to 
the  authorized  access.  Inappropriate  access  to  customer 
sensitive  data  by  cloud  personnel  is  another  risk  that  can 
pose  potential  threat  to  cloud  data.  Assurances  should  be 
provided  to  the  clients  and  proper  practices  and  privacy 
policies  and  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  assure  the 
cloud users of the data safety. The cloud seeker should be 
assured that data hosted on the cloud will be confidential. 
 
4.2. Data Integrity 
 
With  providing  the  security  of  data,  cloud  service 
providers  should  implement  mechanisms  to  ensure  data 
integrity and be able to tell what happened to a certain data 
set and at what point. The cloud provider should make the 
client aware of what particular data is hosted on the cloud, 
the origin and the integrity mechanisms put in place. 
 
4.3. Data Location and Relocation 
 
Cloud Computing offers a high degree of data mobility.

Abstract 
 
Mobility among the masses is now in vogue. In the years to come, work in cloud clouding computing is expected to reach 
greater  heights.  Although,  a new  wave  of  evolution  has broken  shores,  a  vast  expanse  lies  yet  unexplored.  The  mobile 
cloud is Internet-based data, applications and related services accessed through smart phones, laptop computers, tablets 
and  other  portable  devices  .Mobile  cloud  computing  is  differentiated  from  mobile  computing  in  general  because  the 
devices run cloud-based Web apps rather than native apps. Users subscribe to cloud services and access remotely stored 
applications  and  their  associated  data  over  the  Internet.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a  technique,  or  a  model,  which 
allows mobile applications to be built, powered and hosted using cloud computing technology. In this model, the cloud 
performs  the  resource-hungry  activities  such  as  processor-intensive  tasks  and  storing  massive  chunks  of  data. The 
proposed model aims to free mobile devices from performing these tasks; thereby, allowing the devices to run cooler and 
with less power than would have been otherwise required. Using a tailored algorithm to seek out the shortest route to a 
given  cloud  resource  on  the  internet,  this  model  maintains  its  own  database.  When  a  mobile  device  connects  to  the 
internet to seek a cloud based resource, the model identifies  the request and routes it to the shortest path which it has 
kept  track  of  with  the  aid  of  its  constantly  updated  data  table.  This  paper  discusses  the  proposed  model  and  aims  to 
illustrate the manner in which mobile device users would be able to use the cloud application and also take advantage of 
energy savings not only in terms of power consumed, but also most importantly – time.

1. Introduction 
 
1 Mobile cloud computing refers to the availability of cloud 
computing 
It 
incorporates  the  elements  of  mobile  networks  and  cloud 
computing, thereby providing optimal services  for  mobile 
users.  In  mobile  cloud  computing,  mobile  devices  do  not 
need  a  powerful  configuration  (e.g.,  CPU  speed  and 
memory  capacity)  since  all  the  data  and  complicated 
computing  modules  can  be  processed  in  the  clouds 
(http://www.smartdevelopments.org;http://www.readwrite
web.com)  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  the  usage  of  cloud 
computing  in  combination  with  smart  mobile  devices. 
Cloud  computing  exists  when  tasks  and  data  are  kept  on 
the  internet  rather  than  on  individual  devices,  providing 
on-demand  access  of  data.  Applications  are  run  on  a 
remote  server  and  then  sent  to  user.  Because  of  the 
advanced  improvement  in  mobile  browsers  thanks  to 
Apple  and  Google  over  the  past  couple  of  years,  nearly 
every mobile should have a suitable browser according to 
the need. This means that the developers will have a much 
wider  market  and  they  can  bypass  restrictions  created  by 
mobile  operating  system.  Mobile  cloud  computing  gives 
new company chances for mobile network providers also. 

Several  operators  as  Vodafone,  (Swarnpreet  Singh   et  al, 
2012)  Orange  and  Verizon  have  started  to  offer  cloud 
computing services for different companies. Mobile Cloud 
Computing has three components, mobile device, wireless 
communication  channel  and  cloud.  Mobile  devices  have 
resource  constraint  in  terms  of  battery  power,  memory, 
processing  power  and  have  different  types  of  hardware, 
operating  system,  and  input  -output  interface.  Wireless 
communication  channel  has  different 
radio  access 
technologies such as GPRS, 3G, WLAN and WiMax with 
variable  network  conditions  in  terms  of  limited  and 
unstable  bandwidth.  Cloud  Computing  is  facing  various 
security  and  privacy  challenges.  Security  and  privacy 
issues in mobile cloud computing are inherited from cloud 
computing  and  mobile  computing.  Because  of  resource 
constraints,  heavy  security  algorithm  can’t  be  run  on 
mobile  device.  We  need  to  do  efficient  task  portioning 
between  cloud  and  mobile  to  resolve  the  security  and 
privacy  issues  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (Sapna  Malik 
et  al,  2012).  As  an  inheritance  and  development  of  cloud 
computing, resources in mobile cloud computing networks 
are  virtualized  and  assigned  in  a  group  of  numerous 
distributed  computers  rather  than  in  traditional  local 
computers  or  servers,  and  are  provided  to  mobile  devices 
such  as  smartphones,  portable  terminal,  and  so  on.(see 
Figure. 1). Meanwhile, various applications based on

cloudlet  contains  cached  copy  of  data.  It  is  installed 
between client and cloud. The cost of installation is less as 
compared  to  cloud  as  it  is  only  a  data  center  at  business 
premises. A cloudlet services only a few users and has less 
communication  latency  as  compared  to  cloud.  Cloudlet  is 
owned by local business (Satyanarayanan et al,2009).

means  using  portable  devices 
applications  and/or  accessing  remote  applications  via 
wireless  networks.  In  mobile  cloud  computing  mobile 
network  and  cloud  computing  are  combined,  thereby 
providing  an  optimal  services  for  mobile  users.  Cloud 
computing  exists  when  tasks  and  data  are  kept  on  the

In  Non  Cloudlet  Architecture  there  are  three  components 
Mobile  client,  Transmission  channel  and  Cloud.  Mobile 
client  requests  desired  service  from  cloud  and  cloud 
provides the service. Cloud is owned by an organization or 
cloud provider and services thousands of users at time. In 
this  architecture,  main  disadvantage  is  communication 
latency for getting service from distant cloud. The solution 
to  this  problem  is  cloudlet  architecture  in  which  a  local

2.1 Client Mode 
 
In this model, mobile device act as client and mobile user 
access service is offered by cloud by thin layer of interface 
web  browser.  Cloud  charges  for  services  till  the  duration 
client  is  connected.  Client  model  depicts  Software  as  a 
Service model of Cloud computing. 
 
2.2  Client / Cloud model 
 
In  client  /cloud  model,  the  concept  of  task  partitioning 
comes  in  which  mobile  users  give  a  part  of  task  to  cloud 
for processing. 
 
2.3  Cloud Model 
  
In  cloud  model,  mobile  device  itself  is  the  part  of  cloud. 
One or more mobile devices create the structure of cloud. 
 
3. Applications of Mobile Cloud Computing 
 
Some  of  the  applications  of  mobile  cloud  computing  are 
Google's  Gmail  drive,  Maps  and  Navigation  systems  for 
Mobile, 
from 
Motorola(with  a  special  feature  called  remote  wipe) 
Amazon  ‘s  new  "cloud-accelerated"  Web  browser  Silk. 
Silk  is  a  "split  browser  whose  software  resides  both  on 
Kindle  Fire  and  EC2.  The  applications  reinforced  by 
mobile  cloud  computing 
include  mobile  commerce, 
mobile  learning,  and  mobile  healthcare  and  other  areas. 
Mobile  applications  extended  extensive  share  in  a  global 
mobile market. Various mobile applications have engaged 
the  recompenses  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  The 
following are the few inferences: 
 
3.1. m-Commerce 
 
Mobile  commerce  (m-commerce)  is  a  buying  and  selling 
of  products  using  mobile  devices.  The  m-commerce 
applications  normally  used  to  achieve  some  tasks  that 
necessitate  mobility 
transactions  and 
payments,  mobile  messaging,  and  mobile  ticketing).  The 
m-commerce 
various 
low  network  bandwidth,  high 
complications 
complexity of mobile device configurations, and security). 
Subsequently,  m-commerce  applications  are  integrated 
into  cloud  computing  environment  to  solve  these  issues 
(X. Yang et al,2010). 
 
3.2. m-Learning 
 
Mobile  learning  (m-learning)  is  an  electronic  learning  (e-
learning)  and  mobility.  However,  traditional  m-learning 
applications  have  limitations  in  terms  of  high  cost  of 
devices  and  network,  low  network  transmission  rate,  and 
limited educational resources (X. Chen et al, 2010; H. Gao 
et  al,  2010;  Jian  Li,  2010).  Cloud  based  m-learning 
applications  are  presented  to  solve  these  limitations,  for 
example  utilizing  a  cloud  with  the  large  storage  capacity 
and  powerful  processing  ability,  the  applications  offer 

learners  with  much  comfortable  services  in  terms  of 
information size, processing speed. 
 
3.3. m-HealthCare 
 
MCC  in  medical  applications  is  used  to  minimize  the 
limitations  of  traditional  medical  treatment  [e.g.,  small 
physical  storage, security and privacy, and  medical errors 
(D. Kopec et al, 2013)]. Mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) 
offers  mobile  users  with  appropriate  help  to  access 
resources  easily.  m-Healthcare  provides  healthcare 
organizations a diversity of on-demand services on clouds 
rather than standalone applications on local servers. 
 
3.4. m-Banking 
 
M-Banking  is  an  uprising  in  traditional  banking  services, 
where  user  can  avail  the  bank  services  provided  to  them 
through their mobile despite of location and time (Z. Li et 
al, 2001). Transaction can be done even if user is busy in 
his  routine  work  via  SMS  or  the  mobile  Internet  but  can 
also  use  special  programs,  called  mobile  applications, 
downloaded to the mobile device. 
 
3.5. m-Game 
 
Mobile game (m-game) is a prospective market producing 
incomes  for  service  providers.  M-game  can  completely 
offload  game  engine  requiring  large  computing  resource 
(e.g.,  graphic  rendering)  to  the  server  in  the  cloud,  and 
gamers  only  interact  with  the  screen  interface  on  their  
devices  (Jasleen  et  al,  2013) demonstrates  that  offloading 
(multimedia  code)  can  save  energy  for  mobile  devices, 
thereby increasing game playing time on mobile devices. 
 
4. Data Security Issues in the Mobile cloud 
 
4.1. Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Once the client host data to the cloud there should be some 
guarantee  that  access  to  that  data  will  only  be  limited  to 
the  authorized  access.  Inappropriate  access  to  customer 
sensitive  data  by  cloud  personnel  is  another  risk  that  can 
pose  potential  threat  to  cloud  data.  Assurances  should  be 
provided  to  the  clients  and  proper  practices  and  privacy 
policies  and  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  assure  the 
cloud users of the data safety. The cloud seeker should be 
assured that data hosted on the cloud will be confidential. 
 
4.2. Data Integrity 
 
With  providing  the  security  of  data,  cloud  service 
providers  should  implement  mechanisms  to  ensure  data 
integrity and be able to tell what happened to a certain data 
set and at what point. The cloud provider should make the

Consumers do not always know the location of their data. 
However, when an enterprise has some sensitive data that 
is kept on a storage device in the Cloud, they may want to 
know  the  location  of  it.  They  may  also  wish  to  specify  a 
preferred  location  (e.g.  data  to  be  kept  in  India).  This, 
then, requires a contractual agreement, between the Cloud 
provider  and  the  consumer  that  data  should  stay  in  a 
particular  location  or  reside  on  a  given  known  server. 
Also, cloud providers should take responsibility  to ensure 
the security of systems (including data) and provide robust 
authentication 
information. 
Another  issue  is  the  movement  of  data  from  one  location 
to  another.  Data  is  initially  stored  at  an  appropriate 
location decide by the Cloud provider. However, it is often 
moved  from  one  place  to  another.  Cloud  providers  have 
contracts  with  each  other  and  they  use  each  other’s 
resources. 
 
4.4. Data Availability 
 
Customer  data  is  normally  stored  in  chunk  on  different 
servers often residing in different locations or in different 
Clouds.  In  this  case,  data  availability  becomes  a  major 
legitimate  issue  as  the  availability  of  uninterruptible  and 
seamless  provision  becomes  relatively  difficult  (Ali 
Newaz Bahar et al, 2013).  
 
5. Related Work  
 
So  far,  industrial  and  scientific  communities  have  been 
doing  various  researches  for  responding  to  the  above 
challenges.  Some  typical  research  projects  and  cases  are 
presented in the following. A complete outline on various 

researches  and  trends  in  cloud  computing  has  been 
presented  in  (http://www.smartdevelopments.org).  The 
authors  gives  a  survey  of  MCC,  which  helps  general 
readers  have  an  overview  of  the  MCC  including  the 
definition,  architecture,  and  applications.  The  issues, 
existing  solutions  and  approaches  are  presented.  The 
authors  in  paper  (http://www.readwriteweb.com)  discuss 
here  multiple  techniques  and  methods  for  mobile  cloud 
computing. It explores both general-purpose cellular cloud 
computing  solutions  and  application-specific  solutions.  It 
also discusses instances of cellular cloud computing where 
mobile  devices  serve  as  the  cloud  rather  than  the  client. 
Finally  authors  discuss  some 
this 
technology  such  as  privacy  and  data  ownership.  In  paper 
(http://www.vodafone.com) 
the 
architecture  of  MCC  (Mobile  cloud  computing)  with  the 
different  services  needed  by  the  client  and  the  server  in 
MCC. 
 
6. Proposed Work 
 
We are proposed here a  mcc  based architecture using our 
proposed  model  RM  (Resource  Manager),  that  help  us  in 
this  following  manner  .when  the  mobile  users  want  to 
access  the  cloud  based  application  they  first  connect  our 
proposed model and this model then connect the user to  
 
 
proper cloud resource within little time using our proposed 
algorithm and mobile user easily connect their cloud based 
application.  The  architecture  of  MCC  can  be  shown  in 
Figure 5. In Figure 5, mobile devices are connected to the 
mobile networks via base stations (e.g., base transceiver

2.1 Client Mode 
 
In this model, mobile device act as client and mobile user 
access service is offered by cloud by thin layer of interface 
web  browser.  Cloud  charges  for  services  till  the  duration 
client  is  connected.  Client  model  depicts  Software  as  a 
Service model of Cloud computing. 
 
2.2  Client / Cloud model 
 
In  client  /cloud  model,  the  concept  of  task  partitioning 
comes  in  which  mobile  users  give  a  part  of  task  to  cloud 
for processing. 
 
2.3  Cloud Model 
  
In  cloud  model,  mobile  device  itself  is  the  part  of  cloud. 
One or more mobile devices create the structure of cloud. 
 
3. Applications of Mobile Cloud Computing 
 
Some  of  the  applications  of  mobile  cloud  computing  are 
Google's  Gmail  drive,  Maps  and  Navigation  systems  for 
Mobile, 
from 
Motorola(with  a  special  feature  called  remote  wipe) 
Amazon  ‘s  new  "cloud-accelerated"  Web  browser  Silk. 
Silk  is  a  "split  browser  whose  software  resides  both  on 
Kindle  Fire  and  EC2.  The  applications  reinforced  by 
mobile  cloud  computing 
include  mobile  commerce, 
mobile  learning,  and  mobile  healthcare  and  other  areas. 
Mobile  applications  extended  extensive  share  in  a  global 
mobile market. Various mobile applications have engaged 
the  recompenses  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  The 
following are the few inferences: 
 
3.1. m-Commerce 
 
Mobile  commerce  (m-commerce)  is  a  buying  and  selling 
of  products  using  mobile  devices.  The  m-commerce 
applications  normally  used  to  achieve  some  tasks  that 
necessitate  mobility 
transactions  and 
payments,  mobile  messaging,  and  mobile  ticketing).  The 
m-commerce 
various 
low  network  bandwidth,  high 
complications 
complexity of mobile device configurations, and security). 
Subsequently,  m-commerce  applications  are  integrated 
into  cloud  computing  environment  to  solve  these  issues 
(X. Yang et al,2010). 
 
3.2. m-Learning 
 
Mobile  learning  (m-learning)  is  an  electronic  learning  (e-
learning)  and  mobility.  However,  traditional  m-learning 
applications  have  limitations  in  terms  of  high  cost  of 
devices  and  network,  low  network  transmission  rate,  and 
limited educational resources (X. Chen et al, 2010; H. Gao 
et  al,  2010;  Jian  Li,  2010).  Cloud  based  m-learning 
applications  are  presented  to  solve  these  limitations,  for 
example  utilizing  a  cloud  with  the  large  storage  capacity 
and  powerful  processing  ability,  the  applications  offer 

learners  with  much  comfortable  services  in  terms  of 
information size, processing speed. 
 
3.3. m-HealthCare 
 
MCC  in  medical  applications  is  used  to  minimize  the 
limitations  of  traditional  medical  treatment  [e.g.,  small 
physical  storage, security and privacy, and  medical errors 
(D. Kopec et al, 2013)]. Mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) 
offers  mobile  users  with  appropriate  help  to  access 
resources  easily.  m-Healthcare  provides  healthcare 
organizations a diversity of on-demand services on clouds 
rather than standalone applications on local servers. 
 
3.4. m-Banking 
 
M-Banking  is  an  uprising  in  traditional  banking  services, 
where  user  can  avail  the  bank  services  provided  to  them 
through their mobile despite of location and time (Z. Li et 
al, 2001). Transaction can be done even if user is busy in 
his  routine  work  via  SMS  or  the  mobile  Internet  but  can 
also  use  special  programs,  called  mobile  applications, 
downloaded to the mobile device. 
 
3.5. m-Game 
 
Mobile game (m-game) is a prospective market producing 
incomes  for  service  providers.  M-game  can  completely 
offload  game  engine  requiring  large  computing  resource 
(e.g.,  graphic  rendering)  to  the  server  in  the  cloud,  and 
gamers  only  interact  with  the  screen  interface  on  their  
devices  (Jasleen  et  al,  2013) demonstrates  that  offloading 
(multimedia  code)  can  save  energy  for  mobile  devices, 
thereby increasing game playing time on mobile devices. 
 
4. Data Security Issues in the Mobile cloud 
 
4.1. Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Once the client host data to the cloud there should be some 
guarantee  that  access  to  that  data  will  only  be  limited  to 
the  authorized  access.  Inappropriate  access  to  customer 
sensitive  data  by  cloud  personnel  is  another  risk  that  can 
pose  potential  threat  to  cloud  data.  Assurances  should  be 
provided  to  the  clients  and  proper  practices  and  privacy 
policies  and  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  assure  the 
cloud users of the data safety. The cloud seeker should be 
assured that data hosted on the cloud will be confidential. 
 
4.2. Data Integrity 
 
With  providing  the  security  of  data,  cloud  service 
providers  should  implement  mechanisms  to  ensure  data 
integrity and be able to tell what happened to a certain data 
set and at what point. The cloud provider should make the 
client aware of what particular data is hosted on the cloud, 
the origin and the integrity mechanisms put in place. 
 
4.3. Data Location and Relocation 
 
Cloud Computing offers a high degree of data mobility.

to  safeguard  customers’

Consumers do not always know the location of their data. 
However, when an enterprise has some sensitive data that 
is kept on a storage device in the Cloud, they may want to 
know  the  location  of  it.  They  may  also  wish  to  specify  a 
preferred  location  (e.g.  data  to  be  kept  in  India).  This, 
then, requires a contractual agreement, between the Cloud 
provider  and  the  consumer  that  data  should  stay  in  a 
particular  location  or  reside  on  a  given  known  server. 
Also, cloud providers should take responsibility  to ensure 
the security of systems (including data) and provide robust 
authentication 
information. 
Another  issue  is  the  movement  of  data  from  one  location 
to  another.  Data  is  initially  stored  at  an  appropriate 
location decide by the Cloud provider. However, it is often 
moved  from  one  place  to  another.  Cloud  providers  have 
contracts  with  each  other  and  they  use  each  other’s 
resources. 
 
4.4. Data Availability 
 
Customer  data  is  normally  stored  in  chunk  on  different 
servers often residing in different locations or in different 
Clouds.  In  this  case,  data  availability  becomes  a  major 
legitimate  issue  as  the  availability  of  uninterruptible  and 
seamless  provision  becomes  relatively  difficult  (Ali 
Newaz Bahar et al, 2013).  
 
5. Related Work  
 
So  far,  industrial  and  scientific  communities  have  been 
doing  various  researches  for  responding  to  the  above 
challenges.  Some  typical  research  projects  and  cases  are 
presented in the following. A complete outline on various 

researches  and  trends  in  cloud  computing  has  been 
presented  in  (http://www.smartdevelopments.org).  The 
authors  gives  a  survey  of  MCC,  which  helps  general 
readers  have  an  overview  of  the  MCC  including  the 
definition,  architecture,  and  applications.  The  issues, 
existing  solutions  and  approaches  are  presented.  The 
authors  in  paper  (http://www.readwriteweb.com)  discuss 
here  multiple  techniques  and  methods  for  mobile  cloud 
computing. It explores both general-purpose cellular cloud 
computing  solutions  and  application-specific  solutions.  It 
also discusses instances of cellular cloud computing where 
mobile  devices  serve  as  the  cloud  rather  than  the  client. 
Finally  authors  discuss  some 
this 
technology  such  as  privacy  and  data  ownership.  In  paper

architecture  of  MCC  (Mobile  cloud  computing)  with  the 
different  services  needed  by  the  client  and  the  server  in 
MCC. 
 
6. Proposed Work 
 
We are proposed here a  mcc  based architecture using our 
proposed  model  RM  (Resource  Manager),  that  help  us  in 
this  following  manner  .when  the  mobile  users  want  to 
access  the  cloud  based  application  they  first  connect  our 
proposed model and this model then connect the user to  
 
 
proper cloud resource within little time using our proposed 
algorithm and mobile user easily connect their cloud based 
application.  The  architecture  of  MCC  can  be  shown  in 
Figure 5. In Figure 5, mobile devices are connected to the 
mobile networks via base stations (e.g., base transceiver

Abstract 
 
Mobility among the masses is now in vogue. In the years to come, work in cloud clouding computing is expected to reach 
greater  heights.  Although,  a new  wave  of  evolution  has broken  shores,  a  vast  expanse  lies  yet  unexplored.  The  mobile 
cloud is Internet-based data, applications and related services accessed through smart phones, laptop computers, tablets 
and  other  portable  devices  .Mobile  cloud  computing  is  differentiated  from  mobile  computing  in  general  because  the 
devices run cloud-based Web apps rather than native apps. Users subscribe to cloud services and access remotely stored 
applications  and  their  associated  data  over  the  Internet.  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  a  technique,  or  a  model,  which 
allows mobile applications to be built, powered and hosted using cloud computing technology. In this model, the cloud 
performs  the  resource-hungry  activities  such  as  processor-intensive  tasks  and  storing  massive  chunks  of  data. The 
proposed model aims to free mobile devices from performing these tasks; thereby, allowing the devices to run cooler and 
with less power than would have been otherwise required. Using a tailored algorithm to seek out the shortest route to a 
given  cloud  resource  on  the  internet,  this  model  maintains  its  own  database.  When  a  mobile  device  connects  to  the 
internet to seek a cloud based resource, the model identifies  the request and routes it to the shortest path which it has 
kept  track  of  with  the  aid  of  its  constantly  updated  data  table.  This  paper  discusses  the  proposed  model  and  aims  to 
illustrate the manner in which mobile device users would be able to use the cloud application and also take advantage of 
energy savings not only in terms of power consumed, but also most importantly – time. 
 
Keywords: Mobile cloud computing, chunks of data, algorithm, database, internet. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1 Mobile cloud computing refers to the availability of cloud 
computing 
It 
incorporates  the  elements  of  mobile  networks  and  cloud 
computing, thereby providing optimal services  for  mobile 
users.  In  mobile  cloud  computing,  mobile  devices  do  not 
need  a  powerful  configuration  (e.g.,  CPU  speed  and 
memory  capacity)  since  all  the  data  and  complicated 
computing  modules  can  be  processed  in  the  clouds 
(http://www.smartdevelopments.org;http://www.readwrite
web.com)  Mobile  cloud  computing  is  the  usage  of  cloud 
computing  in  combination  with  smart  mobile  devices. 
Cloud  computing  exists  when  tasks  and  data  are  kept  on 
the  internet  rather  than  on  individual  devices,  providing 
on-demand  access  of  data.  Applications  are  run  on  a 
remote  server  and  then  sent  to  user.  Because  of  the 
advanced  improvement  in  mobile  browsers  thanks  to 
Apple  and  Google  over  the  past  couple  of  years,  nearly 
every mobile should have a suitable browser according to 
the need. This means that the developers will have a much 
wider  market  and  they  can  bypass  restrictions  created  by 
mobile  operating  system.  Mobile  cloud  computing  gives 
new company chances for mobile network providers also. 

Several  operators  as  Vodafone,  (Swarnpreet  Singh   et  al, 
2012)  Orange  and  Verizon  have  started  to  offer  cloud 
computing services for different companies. Mobile Cloud 
Computing has three components, mobile device, wireless 
communication  channel  and  cloud.  Mobile  devices  have 
resource  constraint  in  terms  of  battery  power,  memory, 
processing  power  and  have  different  types  of  hardware, 
operating  system,  and  input  -output  interface.  Wireless 
communication  channel  has  different 
radio  access 
technologies such as GPRS, 3G, WLAN and WiMax with 
variable  network  conditions  in  terms  of  limited  and 
unstable  bandwidth.  Cloud  Computing  is  facing  various 
security  and  privacy  challenges.  Security  and  privacy 
issues in mobile cloud computing are inherited from cloud 
computing  and  mobile  computing.  Because  of  resource 
constraints,  heavy  security  algorithm  can’t  be  run  on 
mobile  device.  We  need  to  do  efficient  task  portioning 
between  cloud  and  mobile  to  resolve  the  security  and 
privacy  issues  in  Mobile  Cloud  Computing  (Sapna  Malik 
et  al,  2012).  As  an  inheritance  and  development  of  cloud

are  virtualized  and  assigned  in  a  group  of  numerous 
distributed  computers  rather  than  in  traditional  local 
computers  or  servers,  and  are  provided  to  mobile  devices 
such  as  smartphones,  portable  terminal,  and  so  on.(see

Service model of Cloud computing. 
 
2.2  Client / Cloud model 
 
In  client  /cloud  model,  the  concept  of  task  partitioning 
comes  in  which  mobile  users  give  a  part  of  task  to  cloud 
for processing. 
 
2.3  Cloud Model 
  
In  cloud  model,  mobile  device  itself  is  the  part  of  cloud. 
One or more mobile devices create the structure of cloud. 
 
3. Applications of Mobile Cloud Computing 
 
Some  of  the  applications  of  mobile  cloud  computing  are 
Google's  Gmail  drive,  Maps  and  Navigation  systems  for 
Mobile, 
from 
Motorola(with  a  special  feature  called  remote  wipe) 
Amazon  ‘s  new  "cloud-accelerated"  Web  browser  Silk. 
Silk  is  a  "split  browser  whose  software  resides  both  on 
Kindle  Fire  and  EC2.  The  applications  reinforced  by 
mobile  cloud  computing 
include  mobile  commerce, 
mobile  learning,  and  mobile  healthcare  and  other  areas. 
Mobile  applications  extended  extensive  share  in  a  global 
mobile market. Various mobile applications have engaged 
the  recompenses  of  Mobile  Cloud  Computing.  The 
following are the few inferences: 
 
3.1. m-Commerce 
 
Mobile  commerce  (m-commerce)  is  a  buying  and  selling 
of  products  using  mobile  devices.  The  m-commerce 
applications  normally  used  to  achieve  some  tasks  that 
necessitate  mobility 
transactions  and 
payments,  mobile  messaging,  and  mobile  ticketing).  The 
m-commerce 
various 
low  network  bandwidth,  high 
complications 
complexity of mobile device configurations, and security). 
Subsequently,  m-commerce  applications  are  integrated 
into  cloud  computing  environment  to  solve  these  issues 
(X. Yang et al,2010). 
 
3.2. m-Learning 
 
Mobile  learning  (m-learning)  is  an  electronic  learning  (e-
learning)  and  mobility.  However,  traditional  m-learning 
applications  have  limitations  in  terms  of  high  cost  of 
devices  and  network,  low  network  transmission  rate,  and 
limited educational resources (X. Chen et al, 2010; H. Gao 
et  al,  2010;  Jian  Li,  2010).  Cloud  based  m-learning 
applications  are  presented  to  solve  these  limitations,  for 
example  utilizing  a  cloud  with  the  large  storage  capacity 
and  powerful  processing  ability,  the  applications  offer 

learners  with  much  comfortable  services  in  terms  of 
information size, processing speed. 
 
3.3. m-HealthCare 
 
MCC  in  medical  applications  is  used  to  minimize  the 
limitations  of  traditional  medical  treatment  [e.g.,  small 
physical  storage, security and privacy, and  medical errors 
(D. Kopec et al, 2013)]. Mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) 
offers  mobile  users  with  appropriate  help  to  access 
resources  easily.  m-Healthcare  provides  healthcare 
organizations a diversity of on-demand services on clouds 
rather than standalone applications on local servers. 
 
3.4. m-Banking 
 
M-Banking  is  an  uprising  in  traditional  banking  services, 
where  user  can  avail  the  bank  services  provided  to  them 
through their mobile despite of location and time (Z. Li et 
al, 2001). Transaction can be done even if user is busy in 
his  routine  work  via  SMS  or  the  mobile  Internet  but  can 
also  use  special  programs,  called  mobile  applications, 
downloaded to the mobile device. 
 
3.5. m-Game 
 
Mobile game (m-game) is a prospective market producing 
incomes  for  service  providers.  M-game  can  completely 
offload  game  engine  requiring  large  computing  resource 
(e.g.,  graphic  rendering)  to  the  server  in  the  cloud,  and 
gamers  only  interact  with  the  screen  interface  on  their  
devices  (Jasleen  et  al,  2013) demonstrates  that  offloading 
(multimedia  code)  can  save  energy  for  mobile  devices, 
thereby increasing game playing time on mobile devices. 
 
4. Data Security Issues in the Mobile cloud 
 
4.1. Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
Once the client host data to the cloud there should be some 
guarantee  that  access  to  that  data  will  only  be  limited  to 
the  authorized  access.  Inappropriate  access  to  customer 
sensitive  data  by  cloud  personnel  is  another  risk  that  can 
pose  potential  threat  to  cloud  data.  Assurances  should  be 
provided  to  the  clients  and  proper  practices  and  privacy 
policies  and  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  assure  the 
cloud users of the data safety. The cloud seeker should be 
assured that data hosted on the cloud will be confidential. 
 
4.2. Data Integrity 
 
With  providing  the  security  of  data,  cloud  service 
providers  should  implement  mechanisms  to  ensure  data 
integrity and be able to tell what happened to a certain data 
set and at what point. The cloud provider should make the 
client aware of what particular data is hosted on the cloud, 
the origin and the integrity mechanisms put in place. 
 
4.3. Data Location and Relocation 
 
Cloud Computing offers a high degree of data mobility.  

applications 
(e.g.,

Consumers do not always know the location of their data. 
However, when an enterprise has some sensitive data that 
is kept on a storage device in the Cloud, they may want to 
know  the  location  of  it.  They  may  also  wish  to  specify  a 
preferred  location  (e.g.  data  to  be  kept  in  India).  This, 
then, requires a contractual agreement, between the Cloud 
provider  and  the  consumer  that  data  should  stay  in  a 
particular  location  or  reside  on  a  given  known  server. 
Also, cloud providers should take responsibility  to ensure 
the security of systems (including data) and provide robust 
authentication 
information. 
Another  issue  is  the  movement  of  data  from  one  location 
to  another.  Data  is  initially  stored  at  an  appropriate 
location decide by the Cloud provider. However, it is often 
moved  from  one  place  to  another.  Cloud  providers  have 
contracts  with  each  other  and  they  use  each  other’s 
resources. 
 
4.4. Data Availability 
 
Customer  data  is  normally  stored  in  chunk  on  different 
servers often residing in different locations or in different 
Clouds.  In  this  case,  data  availability  becomes  a  major 
legitimate  issue  as  the  availability  of  uninterruptible  and 
seamless  provision  becomes  relatively  difficult  (Ali 
Newaz Bahar et al, 2013).  
 
5. Related Work  
 
So  far,  industrial  and  scientific  communities  have  been 
doing  various  researches  for  responding  to  the  above 
challenges.  Some  typical  research  projects  and  cases  are 
presented in the following. A complete outline on various 

researches  and  trends  in  cloud  computing  has  been 
presented  in  (http://www.smartdevelopments.org).  The 
authors  gives  a  survey  of  MCC,  which  helps  general 
readers  have  an  overview  of  the  MCC  including  the 
definition,  architecture,  and  applications.  The  issues, 
existing  solutions  and  approaches  are  presented.  The 
authors  in  paper  (http://www.readwriteweb.com)  discuss 
here  multiple  techniques  and  methods  for  mobile  cloud 
computing. It explores both general-purpose cellular cloud 
computing  solutions  and  application-specific  solutions.  It 
also discusses instances of cellular cloud computing where 
mobile  devices  serve  as  the  cloud  rather  than  the  client. 
Finally  authors  discuss  some 
this 
technology  such  as  privacy  and  data  ownership.  In  paper 
(http://www.vodafone.com) 
the 
architecture  of  MCC  (Mobile  cloud  computing)  with  the 
different  services  needed  by  the  client  and  the  server  in 
MCC. 
 
6. Proposed Work 
 
We are proposed here a  mcc  based architecture using our 
proposed  model  RM  (Resource  Manager),  that  help  us  in 
this  following  manner  .when  the  mobile  users  want  to 
access  the  cloud  based  application  they  first  connect  our 
proposed model and this model then connect the user to  
 
 
proper cloud resource within little time using our proposed 
algorithm and mobile user easily connect their cloud based 
application.  The  architecture  of  MCC  can  be  shown  in 
Figure 5. In Figure 5, mobile devices are connected to the 
mobile networks via base stations (e.g., base transceiver

station (BTS), access point, or satellite) that establish and 
control the connections (air links) and functional interfaces 
between  the  networks  and  mobile  devices.  Mobile  users’ 
requests  and  information  (e.g.,  ID  and  location)  are 
transmitted to the central processors that are connected to 
servers  providing  mobile  network  services.  Here,  mobile 
network operators can provide services to mobile users as 
AAA  (for  authentication,  authorization,  and  accounting) 
based on the home agent (HA) and subscribers’ data stored 
in  databases.  After  that,  the  subscribers’  requests  are 
delivered to our proposed model RM (Resource Manager) 
and  it  connects  the  proper  cloud  location  through  the 
Internet. 

7.  Algorithm 
 
1)  RM  (Resource  Manager)  stores  all  information  about 
Cloud  Nodes  like  capacity,  IP  address,  and  shortest  node 
distance and any kinds of information about the nodes.. 
2) All Cloud nodes send periodic information to RM.  
a) Channel capacity 
b) Storage space 
Both  of  the  information  varies  time  to  time  and  also  area 
to area. 
3)  Now  for  t=0,  compare  channel  capacity  if  the  channel 
capacity >0

Else stop 
4) Compare channel capacity, choose the maximum one. 
5)  If  the  channel  capacity  of  the  two  Cloud  nodes  to

6)  Compare  the  signal  strength.  Choose  the  lowest  signal 
strength of same channel capacity.

7) Repeat 4-6 every time while choosing a new cloud node 
to handover. 
8)  Make  a  list  of  the  available  cloud  node  and  store  it  to 
RM.   
9)  Now,  If  a  new  Remote  cloud  node  RCN  wants  to 
handover,  signal  strength  decreases  under  a  certain  level 
i.e. threshold level, it sends a Handover Request to RM via
