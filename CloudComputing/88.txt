ABSTRACT

Cloud Computing is an emerging technology which is widely used in various applications all over the world. Security is
always a major consideration as it holds the sensitive data. It is essential to authenticate the users to provide an authorized access
to their data. In Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), a lot of studies are being carried out to exterminate the issues to make cloud
service more  reliable  and  secure  because  more sensitive data  are  stored  in  the Mobile  Cloud  Environment (MCE). This  paper
elucidates various authentication mechanisms proposed by various researchers in the area of Mobile Cloud. An analytical survey
is also carried out in this paper to identify the problems and issues present in the existing mechanisms.

images of  users  are  captured  with  the  use  of  mobile  phone

proposed scheme is implemented to show that the security is
enhanced with accepted performance level in Mobile Cloud.
The  proposed  solution  is not  only  to  secure  unauthorized

attacks due to the absence of string input from users.

Vineet  Guha  et  al.  [8]  have  described  review  of
certain security concerns in cloud computing technology and
also about certain ways to restrict and overcome such issues
over SaaS & PaaS Layers using mobile technologies. In this
scheme,  user  is  allowed  to  keep  its  information  publicly
accessible  to  all  or  either  secured  or  restricted  that  is
accessible  only  by  providing  legal  key.  Once  this  key  is
provided to the service provider, it actually authenticates the
key along with the network from where the request has been
made and this validation is called as “Digital Confirmation”.
If such information is authenticated and user is found to be
authorized  user  and  are able  to  see  download  and  make
changes to it, the information else invalid and information is
thrown to the user.

Indrajit  Das  et  al.  [9]  have  proposed a  user
registration and authentication method. Both the methods are
secure  and  easy  to  use  by fulfilling  the  needs  of  cloud
service authentication. These methods use a mobile device to
generate  one  time  passwords  in  cloud  services. To  use  the
AES  encryption,  the  client  and  the server  have  been
configured and  communicated. Their  proposed scheme
provided good security and easy to use for clients.

Mohammad  et  al.  [10] suggested a  lightweight
authentication  protocol  for  mobile  cloud  environment.  The
major advantages  of  this  mechanism is, it  supports  local
authentication, user  anonymity and also  resistance  against
attacks  such  as modification  attack, replay  attack, server
spoofing attack, stolen verifier attack and so on. Mobile user
is authenticated in  his/her  mobile network. This mechanism

the Authentication  and

the author proposed cloud security system and contributions
are  made  in  the  area  of  authentication  and  authorization.

Author proposed  the  architecture  which consists of  central
and portal security servers. It has the advantages of flexible,
secure, reliable and effective and it is easy to manage. There
is  no  privacy  in  this  process.  All  security  credential  are
stored  in  central  security  system.  So,  end  user  activities  are
traced by cloud identity service provider.

Chow  et  al.  [13]  discussed  the  framework  and
applications  in  mobile  cloud.  In  this  research, authors  refer
users past behavioral data  for  authentication.  They  have
proposed  a  cloud  authentication  system.  It  has  a  core
authentication service that is trust cube which resides in the
cloud.  The  proposed  system  has  the  tendency to  accept
various authentication methods.

Gokaj  et  al.  [14]  presented  an  authentication
mechanism,  by  using  different  technologies  like  Mobile
Signature, SSL, SOA, SFTP and combine them to provide a
complete  solution  for  a  mobile  cloud  environment.  By  the
Mobile Signature the user identity is assured. This is an easy
way to track the real person of each operation. By using SSL
in  the  middle,  the  communication  channel  is  secured.  The
session key and the sequence number make it impossible for
a  Man-in-The-Middle  to  replace  or  retry  the  network
message.

Deepa  et  al.  [15]  discussed  different  types  of
authentication  methods  such  as  password  and  PIN  based
Authentication,  SMS  based  Authentication,  Symmetric  key,
public  key  Authentication,  and  Biometric  Authentication.
They  have  proposed  multi  factor  Authentication.  It  is  more
complicated  for  an  unauthorized  access.  User Anonymity
and  Availability  are not  addressed.  It  is  more  secure  but
using biometric is more cost efficient.

used SSO Technology. Because of this technology  user can
access multiple services. They said about RBAC policy. This
policy  provides  simplicity  and  flexibility  for  capturing

ABSTRACT

Cloud Computing is an emerging technology which is widely used in various applications all over the world. Security is
always a major consideration as it holds the sensitive data. It is essential to authenticate the users to provide an authorized access
to their data. In Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), a lot of studies are being carried out to exterminate the issues to make cloud
service more  reliable  and  secure  because  more sensitive data  are  stored  in  the Mobile  Cloud  Environment (MCE). This  paper
elucidates various authentication mechanisms proposed by various researchers in the area of Mobile Cloud. An analytical survey
is also carried out in this paper to identify the problems and issues present in the existing mechanisms.

1. INTRODUCTION

technology 

that 

Cloud  computing  is  the  most  demanding  and
emerging technology throughout the  world. Combination of
Mobile  Computing and  Cloud  Computing  is  called Mobile
Cloud Computing (MCC). MCC is defined as “a rich mobile
leverages  uniﬁed  elastic
computing 
resources of varied clouds and network technologies toward
unrestricted  functionality,  storage,  and  mobility  to  serve  a
multitude of  mobile devices anywhere, anytime through the
Internet”. According to International Data Corporation (IDC)
[1], “Mobile Cloud Computing is a new platform combining
the  mobile  devices  and  cloud  computing  to  create  a  new
infrastructure,  whereby  cloud  performs  the  heavy  lifting  of
computing-intensive  tasks  and  storing  massive  amounts  of
data”. Best example for cloud service Amazon EC2, Google
Apps,  etc.  Data 
like
Authentication,  Confidentiality,  Integrity,  and  Availability.
There  is  a  need  to  improve  the  mobile  cloud  security  by
strengthening  the  authentication  system  [2].  Authentication
is  the  key  of  security  services  including  confidentiality  and
integrity  [3].  Authentication  is  the  process  of  verifying  the
user’s  identity  in  order  to  have  authorized  access  to  their
data. Using Authentication parameters, user’s sensitive data
can  be  protected  from  internal  and  external  attack.  This
paper  mainly  discusses on 
the  existing  authentication
mechanisms and their issues.

2. RELATED WORKS

Francisco Corella  et  al.  [4]  proposed  one,  two  and
three factor  authentication  methods that  can  be  used for
mobile  devices.  This  method  provides  strong  security  and
also,  it  provides  more suitable to  use One  Time  Passwords
(OTPs) or ordinary passwords. The proposed authentication

114

methods  simply  use Public  Key  cryptography.  The
advantage  of  this  scheme  is  easy  to  implement  and  deploy,
because  all  cryptography  is condensed in  black  boxes. So,
there is no need to program any cryptographic operations by
developers and easy  to  deploy.  They  do  not  require  Public
Key  Infrastructure  (PKI)  and avoid  the  use  of digital
certificates.

Yogesh  Patel  et  al.  [5]  have  proposed  Multilevel
Authentication.  The  proposed  mechanism aims to  enhance
authorization and authentication process by using multilevel
authentication. It is used to protect cloud from malicious user
and  unauthorized  access.  This  scheme  implements  security
measure  to  protect  data  of  users  which  is  stored  in  cloud
environment.  It  also  provides  service  level  security.  Here,
user  based  access  control  is  applied  over  user's  data. (i.e.)
User can grant, revoke sharing permission at any point.

Yeh  et  al.  [6]  proposed  a  mobile  authentication
system. This system has some features including One Time
Password,  Completely  Automated  Public  Turing  Test
(CAPTT)
to  tell computers and humans  apart,  Voice
identification of creatural features, and visual cryptography,
designing  a  formula  where users are  not  required  to
remember  any  accounts/passwords  when  they  use  the
internet through mobile devices. It aims at smart phones and
the  Cloud.  The  main  thing  is to  improve  the  problems  of
Internet  fishing  and  the  management  of  passwords.  This
research includes phases of registration and login. It not only
increases user’s  convenience  and  security  but  also  prevent
the internet from key log and fishing attack.

Iehab  Al Rassan  et  al.  [7]  have  proposed  and
implemented  a  user  authentication  mechanism using
fingerprint recognition system for Mobile Cloud. Fingerprint

images of  users  are  captured  with  the  use  of  mobile  phone
camera and processed to access mobile cloud resources. The
proposed scheme is implemented to show that the security is
enhanced with accepted performance level in Mobile Cloud.
The  proposed  solution  is not  only  to  secure  unauthorized
access,  but  also  for  database  protection  from  injection
attacks due to the absence of string input from users.

Vineet  Guha  et  al.  [8]  have  described  review  of
certain security concerns in cloud computing technology and
also about certain ways to restrict and overcome such issues
over SaaS & PaaS Layers using mobile technologies. In this
scheme,  user  is  allowed  to  keep  its  information  publicly
accessible  to  all  or  either  secured  or  restricted  that  is
accessible  only  by  providing  legal  key.  Once  this  key  is
provided to the service provider, it actually authenticates the
key along with the network from where the request has been
made and this validation is called as “Digital Confirmation”.
If such information is authenticated and user is found to be
authorized  user  and  are able  to  see  download  and  make
changes to it, the information else invalid and information is
thrown to the user.

Indrajit  Das  et  al.  [9]  have  proposed a  user
registration and authentication method. Both the methods are
secure  and  easy  to  use  by fulfilling  the  needs  of  cloud
service authentication. These methods use a mobile device to
generate  one  time  passwords  in  cloud  services. To  use  the
AES  encryption,  the  client  and  the server  have  been
configured and  communicated. Their  proposed scheme
provided good security and easy to use for clients.

Mohammad  et  al.  [10] suggested a  lightweight
authentication  protocol  for  mobile  cloud  environment.  The
major advantages  of  this  mechanism is, it  supports  local
authentication, user  anonymity and also  resistance  against
attacks  such  as modification  attack, replay  attack, server
spoofing attack, stolen verifier attack and so on. Mobile user
is authenticated in  his/her  mobile network. This mechanism
saves bandwidth, provides low latency.

Jin  et  al.  [11] proposed two  systems  namely user
authentication and mobile device authentication system with
hybrid  cloud  service  server.  In  their research, the  proposed
systems 
user
authorization  and  service  authentication  certificate to the
user in an easy manner. It uses two factor authentication and
RADIUS  method schemes.  So,  a  secure  authentication
system  is proposed  for  the  hybrid  cloud  service  in  Mobile
Cloud  Environment and  also,  their  mechanism  is  able  to
provide security, applicability, availability and  resistance
against Man-in-the-Middle attack. User authorization device
certification and service  authentication  is  supported  by
proposed  scheme.  Complement  security  services  can’t  be
provided by the RADIUS server.

Davit 

[12]  discussed 

the Authentication  and
Authorization  System  in  Cloud  Environment.  In  this  paper,
the author proposed cloud security system and contributions
are  made  in  the  area  of  authentication  and  authorization.

Author proposed  the  architecture  which consists of  central
and portal security servers. It has the advantages of flexible,
secure, reliable and effective and it is easy to manage. There
is  no  privacy  in  this  process.  All  security  credential  are
stored  in  central  security  system.  So,  end  user  activities  are
traced by cloud identity service provider.

Chow  et  al.  [13]  discussed  the  framework  and
applications  in  mobile  cloud.  In  this  research, authors  refer
users past behavioral data  for  authentication.  They  have
proposed  a  cloud  authentication  system.  It  has  a  core
authentication service that is trust cube which resides in the
cloud.  The  proposed  system  has  the  tendency to  accept
various authentication methods.

Gokaj  et  al.  [14]  presented  an  authentication
mechanism,  by  using  different  technologies  like  Mobile
Signature, SSL, SOA, SFTP and combine them to provide a
complete  solution  for  a  mobile  cloud  environment.  By  the
Mobile Signature the user identity is assured. This is an easy
way to track the real person of each operation. By using SSL
in  the  middle,  the  communication  channel  is  secured.  The
session key and the sequence number make it impossible for
a  Man-in-The-Middle  to  replace  or  retry  the  network
message.

Deepa  et  al.  [15]  discussed  different  types  of
authentication  methods  such  as  password  and  PIN  based
Authentication,  SMS  based  Authentication,  Symmetric  key,
public  key  Authentication,  and  Biometric  Authentication.
They  have  proposed  multi  factor  Authentication.  It  is  more
complicated  for  an  unauthorized  access.  User Anonymity
and  Availability  are not  addressed.  It  is  more  secure  but
using biometric is more cost efficient.

Sanjoli et al. [16] discussed Authentication in cloud
security.  In 
the  Rijndael
encryption  algorithm  along  with  EAP-CHAP  encryption
algorithm for Authentication. EAP-CHAP algorithm is used
to  solve  the  authentication  and  Authorization  problems  in
cloud  computing.  Rijndael  algorithm 
is  most  secured
Algorithm.  They  have  mainly  focused  on  the  client  side
security.  Both  encryption  and  decryption are done  by the
user so that, intruder can’t decrypt the data.

Cecil  et  al.  [17]  discussed  different  security  issues
in Mobile  Cloud authentication and  Identity  Management
and  the  way  it works.  They  also  discussed security  issues
and corresponding approaches of Mobile Cloud Computing.
Further, the strengths and weaknesses of user authentication
techniques were also discussed.

Kashif et  al.  [18]  proposed  a  cloud  security  model
and  framework for  Authentication.  It provided convenient
and secure connection to the user for accessing cloud. They
used SSO Technology. Because of this technology  user can
access multiple services. They said about RBAC policy. This
policy  provides  simplicity  and  flexibility  for  capturing
Dynamic requirements.

Neha  et  al.  [19]  designed  cloud  architecture  which
is  secure  at  client  and  server  end,  they  have  used  Elliptic
Curve cryptography  for data encryption and Diffie-Hellman
Key Exchange mechanism for connection establishment. But
the  complexity  of  Cryptographic  algorithm  directly  affects
the  speed  of  access.  They  have  used  Elliptic  Curve
Cryptography (ECC) as computation  cost  and  speed  of
algorithm  is  less.  It  has  a  sub  exponential,  time  complexity
because it is difficult to crack.

3. MOTIVATION

MCC is based on both mobile and cloud computing.
Mobile Cloud Computing has various challenges and issues
especially,  security.  In  security,  Authentication 
the
foremost  issue  as  it  is  the  doorstep  for  accessing  cloud
services. Authentication process helps to prevent user’s data
from  third  parties. The  following  section  makes  a  critical
analysis on various authentication mechanisms proposed for
Mobile Cloud Environment.

5. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED

From  the  broad  literature  review  of existing  and
in  Mobile  Cloud
proposed  authentication  mechanisms 
explained in  the  above section,  it  is  evident  that  there  are
some major issues and challenges in MCC. Those issues and
challenges  are  highlighted  and  categorized  below.  The
security  related  issues  are  then  divided  into  two  broad
categories as listed below.

a. Mobile Cloud Infrastructure Issues
b. Mobile Cloud Communication Channel Issues

5.1 Mobile Cloud Infrastructure Issues

From the cloud  infrastructure  point  of  view,  a
variety  of  attacks  are  possible  on  the  cloud.  Some  of  these
attacks are given below.

116

 Attacks on Virtual Machines
 Authorization and Authentication
 Attacks from Local Users

5.2 Mobile Cloud Communication Channel Issues

A  lot  of  improvement  needs  to  be  done  in  the
mobile cloud communication channel. The following attacks
exist on communication channel.

 Access Control Attacks
 Attacks on Authentication
 Attacks on Availability
 Data Integrity Attacks

Some of the mobile communication channel related

issues are pointed out below.

 Low Bandwidth and Latency problems
 Availability of desired services
 Heterogeneity
 Limited Resources

5.3 Other Issues and Challenges

Even though there are several advantages, the MCC
possesses some limitation which in turn affects the usage of
cloud services. They are,

 Resource Poverty Mobile Devices
 Network Bandwidth
 Security and Privacy
 Latency
 Heterogeneity
 Computing Offloading
 Data Accessibility
 Data Ownership

5.4 Threats in MCC

a) Loss of Data

in 

Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) says that the
data  stored 
the  cloud can  be  stolen  by
intruders/hackers. Data can suffer a natural disaster or
data can be accidentally deleted if a provider of cloud
services does not host proper backup methods. On the
other hand, the user who encrypts his/her data before
uploading them into 
the
encryption key.

the  cloud may lose

b) Service Traffic Hijacking

In the cloud environment, attacker could use
the stolen login credential to capture or give distorted
information or  forge to  redirect  users  to  malicious
sites. Organizations  should not allow the distribution
of  their  login  information  for  all  services.  CSA also
recommends  secure,  strong  two factor  authentication
to reduce the risks.

c) Denial of Service

Service  (DoS) 

The  cloud  can  be  attacked  using Denial  of
the

that  causes  an  overload 

to 

organization, making use of a huge amount of system
resources  and  not  allowing  users to  use  the desired
service.  Media  attention  often  involves DoS attacks
which  can  block  the  cloud  usage. For  example,
attackers  can  launch  DoS  attacks  on  asymmetric
application  layer  by using vulnerabilities  in  the  web
servers, cloud  resources or  other databases to  fill  up
the application with a payload.

d) Malicious Insiders

Without a proper  level  of  security  on SaaS
and PaaS,  an  insider  who  has  improper targets may
gain  access  to the confidential data.  Malicious
insiders are certified to do bigger and greater damage
than  any  other  attacks on  resources.  According  to
CSA, the  system  is  vulnerable  to  attacks  if  the keys
are  not  kept  with  the  customer even  if  encryption  is
applied on the data.

e) Data Theft

The  biggest  risk  in  IT  is  the  theft  of
confidential corporate information, but CSA indicates
that  the cloud  model offers a  new  technology  and  at
the same time it holds the pool of attacks. If the base
of  the  cloud  data  from  multiple  leases  is  not
understood properly, that flaw  in  the  application  of
one  client  can attack  and  affect  the data  of the other
cloud users.

6. CONCLUSION

Mobile  cloud  computing is  a  rich  computing
technology and a profitable field of business people because
it  reduces  the  running  and  development  costs  of Mobile
Cloud  Environment.  Security  is  the  top most  issue  and  it
needs  to  be  resolved.  Only  authorized access to  their data
becomes vital important  in  the  mobile  cloud.  This  paper
analyzed  various  existing authentication mechanisms  and
identified  the  problems  that  need to  be  resolved.  From this
study,  it  is  essential  to  develop  a  user  authentication
mechanism that  is  not  only  secure  but  also  should  be
lightweight and cost efficient.

also about certain ways to restrict and overcome such issues
over SaaS & PaaS Layers using mobile technologies. In this
scheme,  user  is  allowed  to  keep  its  information  publicly
accessible  to  all  or  either  secured  or  restricted  that  is
accessible  only  by  providing  legal  key.  Once  this  key  is
provided to the service provider, it actually authenticates the
key along with the network from where the request has been
made and this validation is called as “Digital Confirmation”.
If such information is authenticated and user is found to be
authorized  user  and  are able  to  see  download  and  make
changes to it, the information else invalid and information is
thrown to the user.

Indrajit  Das  et  al.  [9]  have  proposed a  user
registration and authentication method. Both the methods are
secure  and  easy  to  use  by fulfilling  the  needs  of  cloud
service authentication. These methods use a mobile device to
generate  one  time  passwords  in  cloud  services. To  use  the
AES  encryption,  the  client  and  the server  have  been
configured and  communicated. Their  proposed scheme
provided good security and easy to use for clients.

Mohammad  et  al.  [10] suggested a  lightweight
authentication  protocol  for  mobile  cloud  environment.  The
major advantages  of  this  mechanism is, it  supports  local
authentication, user  anonymity and also  resistance  against
attacks  such  as modification  attack, replay  attack, server
spoofing attack, stolen verifier attack and so on. Mobile user
is authenticated in  his/her  mobile network. This mechanism
saves bandwidth, provides low latency.

Jin  et  al.  [11] proposed two  systems  namely user
authentication and mobile device authentication system with
hybrid  cloud  service  server.  In  their research, the  proposed
systems 
user
authorization  and  service  authentication  certificate to the
user in an easy manner. It uses two factor authentication and
RADIUS  method schemes.  So,  a  secure  authentication
system  is proposed  for  the  hybrid  cloud  service  in  Mobile
Cloud  Environment and  also,  their  mechanism  is  able  to
provide security, applicability, availability and  resistance
against Man-in-the-Middle attack. User authorization device
certification and service  authentication  is  supported  by
proposed  scheme.  Complement  security  services  can’t  be
provided by the RADIUS server.

Davit 

[12]  discussed 

the Authentication  and
Authorization  System  in  Cloud  Environment.  In  this  paper,
the author proposed cloud security system and contributions
are  made  in  the  area  of  authentication  and  authorization.

Author proposed  the  architecture  which consists of  central
and portal security servers. It has the advantages of flexible,
secure, reliable and effective and it is easy to manage. There
is  no  privacy  in  this  process.  All  security  credential  are
stored  in  central  security  system.  So,  end  user  activities  are
traced by cloud identity service provider.

Chow  et  al.  [13]  discussed  the  framework  and
applications  in  mobile  cloud.  In  this  research, authors  refer
users past behavioral data  for  authentication.  They  have
proposed  a  cloud  authentication  system.  It  has  a  core
authentication service that is trust cube which resides in the
cloud.  The  proposed  system  has  the  tendency to  accept
various authentication methods.

Gokaj  et  al.  [14]  presented  an  authentication
mechanism,  by  using  different  technologies  like  Mobile
Signature, SSL, SOA, SFTP and combine them to provide a
complete  solution  for  a  mobile  cloud  environment.  By  the
Mobile Signature the user identity is assured. This is an easy
way to track the real person of each operation. By using SSL
in  the  middle,  the  communication  channel  is  secured.  The
session key and the sequence number make it impossible for
a  Man-in-The-Middle  to  replace  or  retry  the  network
message.

Deepa  et  al.  [15]  discussed  different  types  of
authentication  methods  such  as  password  and  PIN  based
Authentication,  SMS  based  Authentication,  Symmetric  key,
public  key  Authentication,  and  Biometric  Authentication.
They  have  proposed  multi  factor  Authentication.  It  is  more
complicated  for  an  unauthorized  access.  User Anonymity
and  Availability  are not  addressed.  It  is  more  secure  but
using biometric is more cost efficient.

Sanjoli et al. [16] discussed Authentication in cloud
security.  In 
the  Rijndael
encryption  algorithm  along  with  EAP-CHAP  encryption
algorithm for Authentication. EAP-CHAP algorithm is used
to  solve  the  authentication  and  Authorization  problems  in
cloud  computing.  Rijndael  algorithm 
is  most  secured
Algorithm.  They  have  mainly  focused  on  the  client  side
security.  Both  encryption  and  decryption are done  by the
user so that, intruder can’t decrypt the data.

Cecil  et  al.  [17]  discussed  different  security  issues
in Mobile  Cloud authentication and  Identity  Management
and  the  way  it works.  They  also  discussed security  issues
and corresponding approaches of Mobile Cloud Computing.
Further, the strengths and weaknesses of user authentication
techniques were also discussed.

Kashif et  al.  [18]  proposed  a  cloud  security  model
and  framework for  Authentication.  It provided convenient
and secure connection to the user for accessing cloud. They
used SSO Technology. Because of this technology  user can
access multiple services. They said about RBAC policy. This
policy  provides  simplicity  and  flexibility  for  capturing
Dynamic requirements.

Neha  et  al.  [19]  designed  cloud  architecture  which
is  secure  at  client  and  server  end,  they  have  used  Elliptic
Curve cryptography  for data encryption and Diffie-Hellman
Key Exchange mechanism for connection establishment. But
the  complexity  of  Cryptographic  algorithm  directly  affects
the  speed  of  access.  They  have  used  Elliptic  Curve
Cryptography (ECC) as computation  cost  and  speed  of
algorithm  is  less.  It  has  a  sub  exponential,  time  complexity
because it is difficult to crack.

3. MOTIVATION

MCC is based on both mobile and cloud computing.
Mobile Cloud Computing has various challenges and issues
especially,  security.  In  security,  Authentication 
the
foremost  issue  as  it  is  the  doorstep  for  accessing  cloud
services. Authentication process helps to prevent user’s data
from  third  parties. The  following  section  makes  a  critical
analysis on various authentication mechanisms proposed for
Mobile Cloud Environment.

5. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED

From  the  broad  literature  review  of existing  and
in  Mobile  Cloud
proposed  authentication  mechanisms 
explained in  the  above section,  it  is  evident  that  there  are
some major issues and challenges in MCC. Those issues and
challenges  are  highlighted  and  categorized  below.  The
security  related  issues  are  then  divided  into  two  broad
categories as listed below.

a. Mobile Cloud Infrastructure Issues
b. Mobile Cloud Communication Channel Issues

5.1 Mobile Cloud Infrastructure Issues

From the cloud  infrastructure  point  of  view,  a
variety  of  attacks  are  possible  on  the  cloud.  Some  of  these
attacks are given below.

116

 Attacks on Virtual Machines
 Authorization and Authentication
 Attacks from Local Users

5.2 Mobile Cloud Communication Channel Issues

A  lot  of  improvement  needs  to  be  done  in  the
mobile cloud communication channel. The following attacks
exist on communication channel.

 Access Control Attacks
 Attacks on Authentication
 Attacks on Availability
 Data Integrity Attacks

Some of the mobile communication channel related

issues are pointed out below.

 Low Bandwidth and Latency problems
 Availability of desired services
 Heterogeneity
 Limited Resources

5.3 Other Issues and Challenges

Even though there are several advantages, the MCC
possesses some limitation which in turn affects the usage of
cloud services. They are,

 Resource Poverty Mobile Devices
 Network Bandwidth
 Security and Privacy
 Latency
 Heterogeneity
 Computing Offloading
 Data Accessibility
 Data Ownership

5.4 Threats in MCC

a) Loss of Data

in 

Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) says that the
data  stored 
the  cloud can  be  stolen  by
intruders/hackers. Data can suffer a natural disaster or
data can be accidentally deleted if a provider of cloud
services does not host proper backup methods. On the
other hand, the user who encrypts his/her data before
uploading them into 
the
encryption key.

the  cloud may lose

b) Service Traffic Hijacking

In the cloud environment, attacker could use
the stolen login credential to capture or give distorted
information or  forge to  redirect  users  to  malicious
sites. Organizations  should not allow the distribution
of  their  login  information  for  all  services.  CSA also
recommends  secure,  strong  two factor  authentication
to reduce the risks.

c) Denial of Service

Service  (DoS) 

The  cloud  can  be  attacked  using Denial  of
the

that  causes  an  overload 

to 

organization, making use of a huge amount of system
resources  and  not  allowing  users to  use  the desired
service.  Media  attention  often  involves DoS attacks
which  can  block  the  cloud  usage. For  example,
attackers  can  launch  DoS  attacks  on  asymmetric
application  layer  by using vulnerabilities  in  the  web
servers, cloud  resources or  other databases to  fill  up
the application with a payload.

d) Malicious Insiders

Without a proper  level  of  security  on SaaS
and PaaS,  an  insider  who  has  improper targets may
gain  access  to the confidential data.  Malicious
insiders are certified to do bigger and greater damage
than  any  other  attacks on  resources.  According  to
CSA, the  system  is  vulnerable  to  attacks  if  the keys
are  not  kept  with  the  customer even  if  encryption  is
applied on the data.

e) Data Theft

The  biggest  risk  in  IT  is  the  theft  of
confidential corporate information, but CSA indicates
that  the cloud  model offers a  new  technology  and  at
the same time it holds the pool of attacks. If the base
of  the  cloud  data  from  multiple  leases  is  not
understood properly, that flaw  in  the  application  of
one  client  can attack  and  affect  the data  of the other
cloud users.

6. CONCLUSION

Mobile  cloud  computing is  a  rich  computing
technology and a profitable field of business people because
it  reduces  the  running  and  development  costs  of Mobile
Cloud  Environment.  Security  is  the  top most  issue  and  it
needs  to  be  resolved.  Only  authorized access to  their data
becomes vital important  in  the  mobile  cloud.  This  paper
analyzed  various  existing authentication mechanisms  and
identified  the  problems  that  need to  be  resolved.  From this
study,  it  is  essential  to  develop  a  user  authentication
mechanism that  is  not  only  secure  but  also  should  be
lightweight and cost efficient.
