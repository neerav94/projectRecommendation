Abstract 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art  devices  needs  to  be  developed.  To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  the  prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilizes a technology of augmented 
reality.  We  implement  our  app  based  on  the  design  of  user  interface  and  database.  In  the 
future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app.

2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2. Concept design 

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app.

2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

coordinate  function.  Air-tagging  module  searches  past-written  tags  from  SNS-Tag  DB  and 
shows them on a screen. Figure 2 shows technical components and flow diagram.

3. The design of user interface 

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

Abstract 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art  devices  needs  to  be  developed.  To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  the  prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilizes a technology of augmented 
reality.  We  implement  our  app  based  on  the  design  of  user  interface  and  database.  In  the 
future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market. 

 
Keywords: story telling,social network, augmented reality, air-tagging 

 
1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2. Concept design 

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app. 

 

Figure 1. The schematic outline of our proposed app 

 

 
2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

coordinate  function.  Air-tagging  module  searches  past-written  tags  from  SNS-Tag  DB  and 
shows them on a screen. Figure 2 shows technical components and flow diagram.

3. The design of user interface 

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

Abstract 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art  devices  needs  to  be  developed.  To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  the  prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilizes a technology of augmented 
reality.  We  implement  our  app  based  on  the  design  of  user  interface  and  database.  In  the 
future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2. Concept design 

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app. 

 

Figure 1. The schematic outline of our proposed app 

 

 
2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

coordinate  function.  Air-tagging  module  searches  past-written  tags  from  SNS-Tag  DB  and 
shows them on a screen. Figure 2 shows technical components and flow diagram.

3. The design of user interface 

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

“Memorial  Place”  is  the  menu  for  remembering  places  where  we  often  went  in  the  past. 
Second,  “Leaving  Memories”  is  the  menu  for  leaving  traces  of  visitors.  So,  tourists  visit 
famous  places  on  Choong-Jang-Ro,  and  can  write  postscripts  on  the  log  of  our  app.  Third, 
“What  at  Choong-Jang-Ro?”  is  the  menu  for  providing  information  of  places  related  to 
shopping,  performance,  famous  restaurant.  Finally,  “Recommending  Tour  Course”  is  the 
menu for visitors who don’t know Choong-Jang-Ro well.

6. Conclusion and Future work 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but  it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art devices needed to be developed. To achieve this objective, we proposed the prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  had  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilized a technology of augmented 
reality. We implemented our app based on the design of user interface and database.  In 
the future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

6. Conclusion and Future work 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but  it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art devices needed to be developed. To achieve this objective, we proposed the prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  had  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilized a technology of augmented 
reality. We implemented our app based on the design of user interface and database.  In 
the future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

Abstract 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but it was on the

the-art  devices  needs  to  be  developed.  To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  the  prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilizes a technology of augmented

1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2. Concept design 

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app. 

 

Figure 1. The schematic outline of our proposed app 

 

 
2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

coordinate  function.  Air-tagging  module  searches  past-written  tags  from  SNS-Tag  DB  and 
shows them on a screen. Figure 2 shows technical components and flow diagram.

3. The design of user interface 

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

6. Conclusion and Future work 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but  it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art devices needed to be developed. To achieve this objective, we proposed the prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  had  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilized a technology of augmented 
reality. We implemented our app based on the design of user interface and database.  In 
the future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

Abstract 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art  devices  needs  to  be  developed.  To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  the  prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilizes a technology of augmented 
reality.  We  implement  our  app  based  on  the  design  of  user  interface  and  database.  In  the 
future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.

1. Introduction 

Choong-Jang-Ro is one of the most famous places for tourists to go sightseeing, while they 
visited  Gwang-ju.  With  Geum-Nam-Ro  and  Mt.  Moo-Deung,  it  is  a  symbol  of  Gwang-ju. 
Until 1990s, it has been the greatest commercial area in Gwang-ju. In recent times, it has been 
converted to a significant place of culture-centered city by the construction of Asian Culture 
Complex [1].  

As many new residential districts  have been formed throughout Gwang-ju since the mid-
1990s,  Choong-Jang-Ro  has  been  on  the  decline.  Because  of  the  development  of  several 
commercial areas in Gwang-ju, people over their 30s has not come by Choong-Jang-Ro well. 
So, it is full of youngsters in their 10s and 20s. That means that it has been transformed into 
youngster’s road. 

For the activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, a service to let people know it should be provided. 
Furthermore, the service should be executed on state-of-the-art devices such as smart phones 
and  tablet  PCs  because  youngsters  find  information  using  those  devices.  Therefore,  the 
service should involve story telling to recall the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro and the service 
to provide information with respect to culture events and shopping. 

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  propose  an  app  to  let  people  know  Choong-Jang-Ro.  This 
paper  presents  prototype  design  of  the  proposed app.  This  paper is organized as  follows.  In 
Section  2,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  the  proposed  app.  Then,  we  describe  the 
technology  applied  to  our  app  in  Section  3.  Finally,  we  conclude  our  paper  and  describe 
future work in Section 4.

2. Concept design 

2.1. Schematic outline 

In  this section,  we  show  the  schematic  outline  of  our app.  The  objective  of  our app is  to 
digitalize  various  memory  and  information  of  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  has  4 
services. First, we develop a story telling service for the memory of Choong-Jang-Ro using 
augmented reality.  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  live,  direct  or  indirect,  view  of  a physical, 
real-world  environment  whose  elements  are  augmented  (or  supplemented)  by  computer-
generated  sensory  input  such  as  sound,  video,  graphics  or  GPS  data  [2].    Secondly,  we 
provide information service based on AR. What our app provides is the information related to 
famous restaurants, public performance, and shopping. Thirdly, we develop a social network 
service by using Air tagging. Finally, we provide a service to recommend tour course. Figure 
1 shows the schematic outline of our app. 

 

Figure 1. The schematic outline of our proposed app 

 

 
2.2. Technology applied to our app 

We  develop  the  proposed  app  using  3  techniques.  They  are  location-based  service, 
augmented reality, and air-tagging. First, we utilize location-based service module to guide a 
direction to a certain place according to GPS information. If someone clicks a certain place on 
a LBS tour map, our app will display a right direction from current position to that place on a 
smart  phone.  Secondly,  augmented  reality  is  used  to  show  proper  information  pertaining  to 
memorial  places.  If  someone  clicks  a  memorial  place  on  a  Choong-Jang-Ro  map,  we  will 
make appear its history, picture, and related information. Air-tagging is a kind of augmented 
reality. If someone takes a picture of a place located on Choong-Jang-Ro after executing our 
app, several postings which past visitors left are displayed. 

We  obtain  GPS  information  through  GPS  sensor,  gyro  sensor,  and  camera.  Then,  this 
information is delivered to LBS module. LBS module consists of G-Info receive function and 
G-Info matching function. LBS module shows proper direction on LBS tour map using Open 
API  module.  We  match  currently  read  data  to  stored  data  at  GPS  DB.  Augmented  reality 
module consists of LBS module call function and vision-info receive function. According to 
the vision received from a camera of user’s smart phone, AR module displays data related to 
the  vision.  Air-tagging  module  consists  of  tag  location  matching  function  and  air  tag

coordinate  function.  Air-tagging  module  searches  past-written  tags  from  SNS-Tag  DB  and 
shows them on a screen. Figure 2 shows technical components and flow diagram.

3. The design of user interface 

Figure 3 shows the intro page of our app. If a user press “Start” button, he will enter the 
start page of our app. Otherwise, if a user press “Finish” button, our app ends. When a user 
leave his message within our app, he should be logged in. For such a case, it is necessary to 
register himself as a user in our app. 

 

Figure 3. The intro page of our app 

 

 

Our app will begin the process of registering a user, when a user press “User Registration” 
button in intro page. Figure 4 shows the user registration page of our app. A user should fill in 
his information on the blank of a user registration page. Basically, a user should enter name, 
ID,  SSN,  password.  To  confirm  the  password  you  enter,  a  user  has  to  enter  password  once 
again.  If  two  passwords  are  different,  a  user  will  see  an  error  page  on  popup  window.  To 
authenticate a user, our app needs the phone number of a user and telecommunication service 
company which a usre join.

“Memorial  Place”  is  the  menu  for  remembering  places  where  we  often  went  in  the  past. 
Second,  “Leaving  Memories”  is  the  menu  for  leaving  traces  of  visitors.  So,  tourists  visit 
famous  places  on  Choong-Jang-Ro,  and  can  write  postscripts  on  the  log  of  our  app.  Third, 
“What  at  Choong-Jang-Ro?”  is  the  menu  for  providing  information  of  places  related  to 
shopping,  performance,  famous  restaurant.  Finally,  “Recommending  Tour  Course”  is  the 
menu for visitors who don’t know Choong-Jang-Ro well.

5. Implementation 

 

 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol.9, No.2 (2014) 
 
 

We  implement  our  app  on  PhoneGap  which  is  a  leading  hybrid  platform.  PhoneGap 
supports  various  smart  phone  platform  including  iOS,  Android.  So,  our  app  is  executed  on 
any smart phone. 

Figure  13  shows  an  example  page  for  memorial  places  of  Choong-Jang-Ro  based  on 
augmented  reality.  In  the  first,  memorial  places  of  Choong-Jang-Ro  is  marked  on  the  map. 
Then, if a user points out one of marker places, related explanation and picture appears.

6. Conclusion and Future work 

Choong-Jang-Ro has been a central place for a long time in Gwang-ju, but  it was on the 
decline recently. For activation of Choong-Jang-Ro, an app to let people know it on state-of-
the-art devices needed to be developed. To achieve this objective, we proposed the prototype 
design  of  an  app  for  Choong-Jang-Ro.  Our  proposed  app  had  4  services  including  a  story 
telling service, a service to provide information related to Choong-Jang-Ro, a social network 
service, and a service to recommend tour course. Our app utilized a technology of augmented 
reality. We implemented our app based on the design of user interface and database.  In 
the future, we will upgrade our app to launch on a commercial market.
