Abstract.  The  convergence  technologies  in  the  IT  industry  have  applied 
quickly to the elevator industry. The core of the convergence technologies may 
be  the  effective  control  and  maintenance  of  the  machine.  In  this  paper,  we 
propose  the  integration  monitoring  and  control  system  for  the  various  lift 
models.  We  use  the  monitoring  and  control  system  based  on  the  Android 
framework that is rapidly expanding technology in the embedded environment, 
and we propose the design approach for the integration of variety of lift devices 
so that it provide a more efficient and stable service environment. In this way, 
we  could  integrate  various  device  models  of  an  elevator  for  the  management 
and maintenance effectively and quickly.

1      Introduction 

The lift industry lies as an essential part of life with the advancement of the building. 
The  lift  industry  has  a  long  history  and  has  created  a  various  and  heterogeneous 
environment of lift. These situations make difficulties to the convergence in the lift 
and information technique. Currently, in a variety of fields, the elevator system has 
built  with  own  brand  and  machinery  and  operate  the  system  for  management  and 
control  individually.  Such  an  environment,  person  that  is  responsible  for  the 
maintenance  of  each  system  has  excessive  work  due  to  the  need  to  understand  the 
operating manual of the each system. In addition, it makes difficult the integration of 
the  various  elevator  models.  To  solve  this  problem,  in  this  paper,  we  propose  the 
integration  monitoring  and  control  system  for  the  various  lift  models.  We  use  the 
monitoring  and  control  system  based  on  the  Android  framework  that  is  rapidly 
expanding  technology  in  the  embedded  environment,  and  we  propose  the  design

2    The convergence of information technology with the lift system 

Recently,  the  convergence  of  IT  technology  with  the  lift  system  can  be 
summarized as the CCTV, digital signage, remote control and emergency direct call 
system.  And  these  convergence  technologies  associated  with  the  lift  safety  and  the 
purpose of providing convenience to the user. CCTV has operated for the safety and 
security of the passengers mandatory. And also the emergency direct call system has 
operated  to  ensure  call  connectivity  when  the  absence  of  the  administrator  occurs 
[1][2].  The  remote  control  system  has  operated  by  self-produced  by  the  lift 
manufacturer. And the technology has been increasing for the safety elements [3]. In 
addition,  the  fields  of  digital  signage  has  utilized  for  the  convenience  of  customers 
and a means of passing information, it is emerging as an advanced elements of the lift 
[4]. However, because the each convergence technologies are operated independently, 
these methods of the integrated utilize are insufficient.
