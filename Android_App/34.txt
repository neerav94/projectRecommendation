Abstract.  Existing  tracking  systems  are  insufficient  to  provide  services  that 
customers  can  be  satisfied  with.  Competition  between  logistics  companies  is 
increasing  and  customers  of  such  logistics  services  are  increasing  requiring 
more. But at present, the response to such requests can hardly be seen as timely 
or  appropriate.  Since  customers  of  logistics  services  not  only  wish  to  receive 
their ordered products but also check where their item is and how the delivery is 
being processed, companies provide location information over the internet. But 
updates  on  such  information  is  hardly  in  real  time,  leading  to  a  discrepancy 
between  information  online  and  actual  location.  Existing  systems  cannot 
address  such  issues  perfectly,  nor  are  there  technologies  that  can  meet  such 
needs. As such, this paper suggests a system that can improve customer services 
and  convenience,  work  efficiency  and  profitability  for  the  logistics  company. 
The system was designed and developed as a high-functioning intellectual App 
Multi Tracking System that is based on IoT and RTLS, which sets it apart from 
existing tracking systems.

1      Introduction 

According  to  ‘the  survey  on  usage  of  courier  services’  (conducted  on  February  17, 
2013),  the  total  volume  handled  increased  at  an  annual  rate  of  17%  on  average, 
starting  in  2002.  Revenue  also  increased  almost  five-fold  from  61.8  billion  Won  in 
2002 to 323 billion Won in 2012. [1,2] 

Tracking  systems  are  used  in  various  fields  including  for  transport  and  military 
purposes.  With  recent  developments  of  the  tracking  system  and  IoT  technology,  a 
ubiquitous  approach  to  human  life  has  been  undertaken.  IT  is  now  being  applied  to 
check and manage what is going on on-site and monitor the social environment. [3,4] 
This  paper  suggests  a  Tracking  System  that  can  meet  the  complicated  needs  and 
requests of customers of logistics services and strengthen the competitiveness of the 
logistics company by taking advantage of IoT and RTLS technologies.

This paper suggests the development of an intellectual Tracking App System to track 
in  real  time  the  location  of  items.  To  develop  this  system,  a  development  plan  was 
established and data investigation and research was conducted. The research showed 
that  there  is  no  related  system  that  has  been  commercialized  and  in  use.  The  paper 
thus  suggests  an  IoT  and  RTLS-based  Intellectual  Tracking  App  System  to  resolve 
existing issues in the system. 

There is a preceding study on the establishment of a system to use GPS to identify 
the location of an item by attaching to it an RFID-based RTLS tag and monitoring the 
progress  in  real  time.  [5]  According  to  Kim  [6],  there  are  also  related  studies  on 
tracking systems that use RTLS (Real Time Location System) and not GPS to attach a 
tag to the item and track it in real time. 

3      The  Configuration  of  an  Intellectual  Multi  Tracking  System 
for Delivery 

This system can be categorized into four types: a tracking application for the customer 
to  check  the  progress  on  his  delivery,  a  delivery  personnel  viewer  application  that 
allows the personnel to check on the order of delivery, a back ground application that 
tracks  the movement of the delivery team,  and an  M/W that controls  and overviews 
the  application.  The  three  Android-based  applications  use  Socket  communication  to 
access  the  M/W  that  has  been  developed  in  del  phi  language.  Each  has  a  different 
protocol applied to distinguish themselves in the M/W and receive different response 
data. 

The  Back  Ground  Application  System  sends  information  such  as  the  current 
location  of  the  delivery  personnel,  transmission  time  and  delivery  personnel  every 
five  minutes  to  the  server. The  M/W  analyzes this data and stores it in the DB.  The 
saved  data  is  then  sent  again  to  the  Android-based  employee  delivery  Viewer 
Application    and the package Tracking Application for customers. Fig. 1 shows the 
configuration of the intellectual Multi Tracking System for delivery.

The Android-based employee delivery Viewer Application is a program provided for 
the  convenience  and  accurate  work  flow  of  delivery  personnel.  It  has  an  algorithm 
that automatically calculates the shortest distance for delivering items and the order of 
delivery. A day’s work starts by sending the customer an estimated time of delivery. 
After that, GPS is used to re-measure the anticipated delivery time every 5 minutes, 
updating the estimated delivery time on the customer’s app.    The delivery personnel, 
when  a  delivery  is  completed,  inputs  the  customer’s  signature  and  presses  the 
‘complete’ button. This shows which areas have completed delivery by marking them 
in different colors, and then synchronizing this information with the customer system 
and work system. The delivery personnel can check the customers’ data with just one 
click and can take advantage of the function that allows one to send text messages or 
phone  calls.  Fig.  2  shows  the  UI  configuration  of  the  employee  delivery  viewer 
application. 

 

 

Fig. 2. UI of the Viewer Application for delivery personnel 

The Tracking Application for customers operates on the app as a program catering 
to better convenience and services for the customers. Using the customer information 
and the shipping invoice information, the system allows the daily work process of the 
delivery  personnel  who  is  in  charge  of  the  customer’s  package.  The  customer  can 
check  the  estimated  delivery  time  and  track  the  delivery.  In  the  customer  app,  the 
status  message  can  be  input  to  show  the  delivery  personnel  in  real  time  one’s  own 
status. 

To operate the package tracking application for customers, the Show button should 
be clicked. This will show in real time the location of the delivery personnel in charge, 
and  up  to  where  the  delivery  has  been  completed.  The  Message  button  allows  the 
customer to leave a message about his status, which is synchronized in real time with 
the  application  for  the  delivery  personnel.  The  Information  button  allows  the 
customer  to  see  the  information  on  the  delivery  personnel,  and  by  clicking  on  the 
telephone  icon  or  the  message  icon,  the  customer  can  reach  the  delivery  personnel. 
Fig.  3  shows  how  the  UI  of  the  package  tracking  application  for  customers  is 
configured.

5      Conclusion   

While the environment for the logistics business is currently undergoing rapid change 
and there has been a drastic increase in annual volume of packages handled by courier 
services,  the  existing  package  tracking  system  leaves  a  lot  to  be  desired  in  terms  of 
meeting customer satisfaction. 

This  system  has  developed  a  highly  efficient,  highly  functional  system  based  on 
IoT and RTLS to introduce new technology to the logistics market. This enables the 
provision of improved customer services and convenience, higher work efficiency and 
more opportunities for profit. The new system is an intellectual logistics system that 
supports reliability in real-time location using complex sensors.

Tracking  systems  are  used  in  various  fields  including  for  transport  and  military 
purposes.  With  recent  developments  of  the  tracking  system  and  IoT  technology,  a 
ubiquitous  approach  to  human  life  has  been  undertaken.  IT  is  now  being  applied  to 
check and manage what is going on on-site and monitor the social environment. [3,4] 
This  paper  suggests  a  Tracking  System  that  can  meet  the  complicated  needs  and 
requests of customers of logistics services and strengthen the competitiveness of the 
logistics company by taking advantage of IoT and RTLS technologies.

This paper suggests the development of an intellectual Tracking App System to track 
in  real  time  the  location  of  items.  To  develop  this  system,  a  development  plan  was 
established and data investigation and research was conducted. The research showed 
that  there  is  no  related  system  that  has  been  commercialized  and  in  use.  The  paper 
thus  suggests  an  IoT  and  RTLS-based  Intellectual  Tracking  App  System  to  resolve 
existing issues in the system. 

There is a preceding study on the establishment of a system to use GPS to identify 
the location of an item by attaching to it an RFID-based RTLS tag and monitoring the 
progress  in  real  time.  [5]  According  to  Kim  [6],  there  are  also  related  studies  on 
tracking systems that use RTLS (Real Time Location System) and not GPS to attach a 
tag to the item and track it in real time. 

3      The  Configuration  of  an  Intellectual  Multi  Tracking  System 
for Delivery 

This system can be categorized into four types: a tracking application for the customer 
to  check  the  progress  on  his  delivery,  a  delivery  personnel  viewer  application  that 
allows the personnel to check on the order of delivery, a back ground application that 
tracks  the movement of the delivery team,  and an  M/W that controls  and overviews 
the  application.  The  three  Android-based  applications  use  Socket  communication  to 
access  the  M/W  that  has  been  developed  in  del  phi  language.  Each  has  a  different 
protocol applied to distinguish themselves in the M/W and receive different response 
data. 

The  Back  Ground  Application  System  sends  information  such  as  the  current 
location  of  the  delivery  personnel,  transmission  time  and  delivery  personnel  every 
five  minutes  to  the  server. The  M/W  analyzes this data and stores it in the DB.  The 
saved  data  is  then  sent  again  to  the  Android-based  employee  delivery  Viewer 
Application    and the package Tracking Application for customers. Fig. 1 shows the 
configuration of the intellectual Multi Tracking System for delivery.

The Android-based employee delivery Viewer Application is a program provided for 
the  convenience  and  accurate  work  flow  of  delivery  personnel.  It  has  an  algorithm 
that automatically calculates the shortest distance for delivering items and the order of 
delivery. A day’s work starts by sending the customer an estimated time of delivery. 
After that, GPS is used to re-measure the anticipated delivery time every 5 minutes, 
updating the estimated delivery time on the customer’s app.    The delivery personnel, 
when  a  delivery  is  completed,  inputs  the  customer’s  signature  and  presses  the 
‘complete’ button. This shows which areas have completed delivery by marking them 
in different colors, and then synchronizing this information with the customer system 
and work system. The delivery personnel can check the customers’ data with just one 
click and can take advantage of the function that allows one to send text messages or 
phone  calls.  Fig.  2  shows  the  UI  configuration  of  the  employee  delivery  viewer 
application.

The Tracking Application for customers operates on the app as a program catering 
to better convenience and services for the customers. Using the customer information 
and the shipping invoice information, the system allows the daily work process of the 
delivery  personnel  who  is  in  charge  of  the  customer’s  package.  The  customer  can 
check  the  estimated  delivery  time  and  track  the  delivery.  In  the  customer  app,  the 
status  message  can  be  input  to  show  the  delivery  personnel  in  real  time  one’s  own 
status. 

To operate the package tracking application for customers, the Show button should 
be clicked. This will show in real time the location of the delivery personnel in charge, 
and  up  to  where  the  delivery  has  been  completed.  The  Message  button  allows  the 
customer to leave a message about his status, which is synchronized in real time with 
the  application  for  the  delivery  personnel.  The  Information  button  allows  the 
customer  to  see  the  information  on  the  delivery  personnel,  and  by  clicking  on  the 
telephone  icon  or  the  message  icon,  the  customer  can  reach  the  delivery  personnel. 
Fig.  3  shows  how  the  UI  of  the  package  tracking  application  for  customers  is 
configured.

5      Conclusion   

While the environment for the logistics business is currently undergoing rapid change 
and there has been a drastic increase in annual volume of packages handled by courier 
services,  the  existing  package  tracking  system  leaves  a  lot  to  be  desired  in  terms  of 
meeting customer satisfaction. 

This  system  has  developed  a  highly  efficient,  highly  functional  system  based  on 
IoT and RTLS to introduce new technology to the logistics market. This enables the 
provision of improved customer services and convenience, higher work efficiency and 
more opportunities for profit. The new system is an intellectual logistics system that 
supports reliability in real-time location using complex sensors.
