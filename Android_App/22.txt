increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an 
without 
programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like 
student  perceptions  of 
technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

number  of  them  to  consider  changing  or 
augmenting their college majors.  

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest 

frequently 

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an 
without 
programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like 
student  perceptions  of 
technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant 

change 

this 

number  of  them  to  consider  changing  or 
augmenting their college majors.  

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest 

frequently 

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”  

(2003) 

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.  

2.  MOTIVATION 

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an 
without 
programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like 
student  perceptions  of 
technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”  

(2003) 

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

students  surveyed,  59  (87%)  did  not  have  a 
minor.  Table 1 below illustrates the distribution 
of the business majors represented in the class. 

Female/Male Makeup 
Female  representation  in  CIS  related  jobs  has 
declined  over  the  last  two  decades.    Ashcroft 
and Blithe (2009) note that in 1991, 36% of the 
IT  workforce  was  female  and  in  2008  it  was 
down  to  25%.    In  the  academic  environment, 
Soe,  Guthrie,  Yakura,  and  Hwang  (2012)  noted 
a  decline  in  female  enrollment  in  CIS-related 
majors.    Soe  et  al.,  (2012)  stated  that  in  Fall 
2009,  female  enrollment  in  the  CIS  program  at 
California  State  Polytechnic  University,  Pomona 
was  16%  and  fell  to  11%  the  following  year.

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

possible  major  or  adding  a  CIS  minor  after 
completing the mobile app project. 
 

Career Implications 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  career  goal  impact  the 
project had on students.  Regardless of whether 
they  wanted  to  change  their  major  or  add  a

that  creating  a  mobile  app  changed  their 
perception  of  the  potential  of  app  development 
in helping them meet their career goals.

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.  

2.  MOTIVATION 

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an

programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like

technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

students  surveyed,  59  (87%)  did  not  have  a 
minor.  Table 1 below illustrates the distribution 
of the business majors represented in the class. 

Female/Male Makeup 
Female  representation  in  CIS  related  jobs  has 
declined  over  the  last  two  decades.    Ashcroft 
and Blithe (2009) note that in 1991, 36% of the 
IT  workforce  was  female  and  in  2008  it  was 
down  to  25%.    In  the  academic  environment, 
Soe,  Guthrie,  Yakura,  and  Hwang  (2012)  noted 
a  decline  in  female  enrollment  in  CIS-related 
majors.    Soe  et  al.,  (2012)  stated  that  in  Fall 
2009,  female  enrollment  in  the  CIS  program  at 
California  State  Polytechnic  University,  Pomona 
was  16%  and  fell  to  11%  the  following  year.

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

or  agreed  that  they  were  considering  CIS  as  a 
possible  major  or  adding  a  CIS  minor  after 
completing the mobile app project. 
 

Career Implications 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  career  goal  impact  the 
project had on students.  Regardless of whether 
they  wanted  to  change  their  major  or  add  a 
minor,  51%  either  strongly  agreed  or  agreed 
that  creating  a  mobile  app  changed  their 
perception  of  the  potential  of  app  development 
in helping them meet their career goals.

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.  

2.  MOTIVATION 

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an 
without 
programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like 
student  perceptions  of 
technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest 

frequently 

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”  

(2003) 

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

students  surveyed,  59  (87%)  did  not  have  a 
minor.  Table 1 below illustrates the distribution 
of the business majors represented in the class. 

Female/Male Makeup 
Female  representation  in  CIS  related  jobs  has 
declined  over  the  last  two  decades.    Ashcroft 
and Blithe (2009) note that in 1991, 36% of the 
IT  workforce  was  female  and  in  2008  it  was 
down  to  25%.    In  the  academic  environment, 
Soe,  Guthrie,  Yakura,  and  Hwang  (2012)  noted 
a  decline  in  female  enrollment  in  CIS-related 
majors.    Soe  et  al.,  (2012)  stated  that  in  Fall 
2009,  female  enrollment  in  the  CIS  program  at 
California  State  Polytechnic  University,  Pomona 
was  16%  and  fell  to  11%  the  following  year.

taking the MIS class. 

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

or  agreed  that  they  were  considering  CIS  as  a 
possible  major  or  adding  a  CIS  minor  after 
completing the mobile app project. 
 

Career Implications 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  career  goal  impact  the 
project had on students.  Regardless of whether 
they  wanted  to  change  their  major  or  add  a 
minor,  51%  either  strongly  agreed  or  agreed 
that  creating  a  mobile  app  changed  their 
perception  of  the  potential  of  app  development 
in helping them meet their career goals.

students.    This  coupled  with  the  51%  stating 
that  it  helped  with  their  career  goals  indicates

Figure  6  shows  the  progression  of  the  mobile

requirement was to certify an app and place it in 
the  store.    Extra  credit  was  awarded  to  those 
students  that  issued  a  second  release  of  their 
app  in  the  store  of  which  30  (60%)  did.    Even 
with  the  difficulties  encountered  when  creating 
the  app,  71%  of  the  students  are  more  inclined 
to create additional apps in the future.

old  daughter.    Like  most  students  in  the  class, 
she had no experience developing a mobile app.  
In fact, she did not own a smartphone.  With her 
four-year old daughter in tow, the student came 
to the office hours being held in a computer lab 
to discuss beginning the project.  The discussion 
did  not  initially  start  with  the  technology  that 
would  be  used  but  rather  what  topic/subject 
would  be  fun  to  focus  on  when  developing  her 
app.    The  student  was  having  difficulty  on  what

10. QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS 

As  part  of  the  survey,  one  of  the  open-ended 
questions  students  were  asked  was  “what  did 
you  enjoy  most  about  this  project?”.    Almost 
every  respondent,  with  no  external  prompts, 
used the words “creative” or “creativity” in their 
positive  responses.    A  sampling  of  verbatim 
responses is: 

“Coming up with the idea of something I 
enjoyed doing and then figuring how to link it to 
sites and videos that I visit.” 

 
to create, and making it into a reality.” 

“Getting  to  think  of  what  app  I  wanted 

“I enjoyed the freedom of creativity that 
 
was  involved  with  the  project.   There  were  no 
limitations  on  what  we  could  or  couldn't  do,  so 

that  made  it  much  easier  to  be  interested  and 
involved in the success of this project.” 

 
“I  really  enjoy  the  opportunity  to  create 
a web app and find out ways of making your app 
successful.” 

 
“I  really  liked  the  designing  of  the  app 
the  most.  I  also  enjoyed  thinking  about  this 
project as one starting a company.” 

 
“I  thought  that  the  project  was  a  new 
experience and it is something I found extremely 
useful. In the world of technology today creating 
a  mobile  app  can  be  a  great  skill  that  you  can 
apply to a job. “ 

 
“The creative aspect of making your own 
app,  the  process  of  learning  it,  and  seeing  your 
creation come to life.” 

 

“Watching the project come to life.” 

Another  open-ended  questions  was  “What  did 
you  enjoy  the  least  or  find  the  most  frustrating 
with this project?”.  Two dominant themes were 
evident in the answers: one related to the short 
deadline  for  the  first  project,  and  the  other  to 
getting through store certification.   

The  short  deadline  was  imposed  because  our 
experience shows that no matter how much time 
you  give  students,  most  will  wait  until  there  is 
just  enough  time  before  starting.    We  wanted 
the  students  to  get  through  the  certification 
process  early  so  they  could  have  time  for  user 
feedback and to submit updates.   

The  second  set  of  frustrations  related  to  the 
store certification processes, some of which was 
not  the  students’  fault.  During  the  project  the 
Microsoft  Windows  stores  were  going  through 
rapid  and  significant  redesigns,  and  at  times 
certain  browsers  weren’t  supported,  or  there 
were  unexplained  file  upload  issues.  Some 
quality issues existed with respect to the human 
testers  not  providing  detailed  feedback.    While 
all  of  these  were  eventually  resolved,  it  did 
understandably  cause  students  frustration.    In 
some  cases  it  appeared  that  students  were  not 
used  to  being  accountable  to  an  unsympathetic 
third-party’s rules and requirements that in their 
mind  were  trivial,  such  as  the  requirement  to 
not  have  any  visible  borders  on  screen  capture 
images. 

A sampling of verbatim responses is: 

“Getting  a  certified  file  caused  me  the 
most frustration. The error messages didn't have 
a  clear  solution  and  it  was  extremely  hard 
because  I  had  a  Mac.  I  think  that  the  project  is

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.  

2.  MOTIVATION 

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an

programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like 
student  perceptions  of 
technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

augmenting their college majors.  

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest 

frequently 

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”  

(2003) 

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

major  and  if  they  had  minors.    Of  the  68 
students  surveyed,  59  (87%)  did  not  have  a 
minor.  Table 1 below illustrates the distribution 
of the business majors represented in the class. 

Female/Male Makeup 
Female  representation  in  CIS  related  jobs  has 
declined  over  the  last  two  decades.    Ashcroft 
and Blithe (2009) note that in 1991, 36% of the 
IT  workforce  was  female  and  in  2008  it  was 
down  to  25%.    In  the  academic  environment, 
Soe,  Guthrie,  Yakura,  and  Hwang  (2012)  noted 
a  decline  in  female  enrollment  in  CIS-related 
majors.    Soe  et  al.,  (2012)  stated  that  in  Fall 
2009,  female  enrollment  in  the  CIS  program  at 
California  State  Polytechnic  University,  Pomona 
was  16%  and  fell  to  11%  the  following  year.

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

or  agreed  that  they  were  considering  CIS  as  a 
possible  major  or  adding  a  CIS  minor  after 
completing the mobile app project. 
 

Career Implications 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  career  goal  impact  the 
project had on students.  Regardless of whether 
they  wanted  to  change  their  major  or  add  a 
minor,  51%  either  strongly  agreed  or  agreed 
that  creating  a  mobile  app  changed  their 
perception  of  the  potential  of  app  development 
in helping them meet their career goals.

Figure  6  shows  the  progression  of  the  mobile

requirement was to certify an app and place it in 
the  store.    Extra  credit  was  awarded  to  those 
students  that  issued  a  second  release  of  their 
app  in  the  store  of  which  30  (60%)  did.    Even 
with  the  difficulties  encountered  when  creating 
the  app,  71%  of  the  students  are  more  inclined 
to create additional apps in the future.

students  in  the  course.    The  project  provided 
extra  credit  opportunities  if  students  reviewed 
two other apps.  Of the 25 students whose apps 
were  reviewed,  only  12  (48%)  felt  the  reviews 
motivated  them  to  submit  a  second  release  of

she had no experience developing a mobile app.  
In fact, she did not own a smartphone.  With her 
four-year old daughter in tow, the student came 
to the office hours being held in a computer lab 
to discuss beginning the project.  The discussion 
did  not  initially  start  with  the  technology  that 
would  be  used  but  rather  what  topic/subject 
would  be  fun  to  focus  on  when  developing  her 
app.    The  student  was  having  difficulty  on  what

10. QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS 

As  part  of  the  survey,  one  of  the  open-ended 
questions  students  were  asked  was  “what  did 
you  enjoy  most  about  this  project?”.    Almost 
every  respondent,  with  no  external  prompts, 
used the words “creative” or “creativity” in their 
positive  responses.    A  sampling  of  verbatim 
responses is: 

“Coming up with the idea of something I 
enjoyed doing and then figuring how to link it to 
sites and videos that I visit.” 

 
to create, and making it into a reality.” 

“Getting  to  think  of  what  app  I  wanted 

“I enjoyed the freedom of creativity that 
 
was  involved  with  the  project.   There  were  no 
limitations  on  what  we  could  or  couldn't  do,  so 

that  made  it  much  easier  to  be  interested  and 
involved in the success of this project.” 

 
“I  really  enjoy  the  opportunity  to  create 
a web app and find out ways of making your app 
successful.” 

 
“I  really  liked  the  designing  of  the  app 
the  most.  I  also  enjoyed  thinking  about  this 
project as one starting a company.” 

 
“I  thought  that  the  project  was  a  new 
experience and it is something I found extremely 
useful. In the world of technology today creating 
a  mobile  app  can  be  a  great  skill  that  you  can 
apply to a job. “ 

 
“The creative aspect of making your own 
app,  the  process  of  learning  it,  and  seeing  your 
creation come to life.” 

 

“Watching the project come to life.” 

Another  open-ended  questions  was  “What  did 
you  enjoy  the  least  or  find  the  most  frustrating 
with this project?”.  Two dominant themes were 
evident in the answers: one related to the short 
deadline  for  the  first  project,  and  the  other  to 
getting through store certification.   

The  short  deadline  was  imposed  because  our 
experience shows that no matter how much time 
you  give  students,  most  will  wait  until  there  is 
just  enough  time  before  starting.    We  wanted 
the  students  to  get  through  the  certification 
process  early  so  they  could  have  time  for  user 
feedback and to submit updates.   

The  second  set  of  frustrations  related  to  the 
store certification processes, some of which was 
not  the  students’  fault.  During  the  project  the 
Microsoft  Windows  stores  were  going  through 
rapid  and  significant  redesigns,  and  at  times 
certain  browsers  weren’t  supported,  or  there 
were  unexplained  file  upload  issues.  Some 
quality issues existed with respect to the human 
testers  not  providing  detailed  feedback.    While 
all  of  these  were  eventually  resolved,  it  did 
understandably  cause  students  frustration.    In 
some  cases  it  appeared  that  students  were  not 
used  to  being  accountable  to  an  unsympathetic 
third-party’s rules and requirements that in their 
mind  were  trivial,  such  as  the  requirement  to 
not  have  any  visible  borders  on  screen  capture 
images. 

A sampling of verbatim responses is: 

“Getting  a  certified  file  caused  me  the 
most frustration. The error messages didn't have 
a  clear  solution  and  it  was  extremely  hard 
because  I  had  a  Mac.  I  think  that  the  project  is

opportunities.” 

it  comes 

“Not  knowing  if  my  app  was 
going  to  get  certified  or  not.  Waiting  time.” 

 

“The  certification  part  caused  me 
frustration.  I hated waiting 3-5 days for my app 
to  either  be 
  approved  or  denied 
certification.   The  Microsoft  tester  was  not  clear 
on what was wrong with my app.” 

 

 

“The  certification  process  was  annoying, 
because  I  kept  getting  denied  and  the  errors  it 
would  give  me  were  not  specific  enough  for 
beginners  to  understand  where  the  problem 
needed to be fixed.” 

11. DEVELOPER COMMUNITY ROLES 

As  suggested  by  Monroy-Hernandez  et  al. 
(2008) and Lave & Wenger (1991), we observed 
students  forming  into  communities  of  practice 
and evolving through a variety of role stages.   

students 

Passive Consumers 
Initially  most 
start  as  passive 
consumers.  We  encouraged  this  role  by  having 
students  browse  the  app  stores  to  see  what  is 
out  there  and  to  identify  aspects  of  successful 
apps.   

We  also  encouraged  students  to  seek  out  apps 
that potentially do what they are thinking about 
doing  and thereby  identify  potential  competitors 
and  ways  in  which  they  could  improve  upon 
existing apps.   

Active Consumers 
We don’t see the active consumer role come into 
play  until  a  bit  later.    Once  students  started 
publishing  their  apps,  we  invited  them  to  rate 
and  review  each  other’s  apps  both  to  help drive 
downloads  and  as  a  show  of  mutual  support.  
We  incented  this  behavior  by  offering  extra 
credit for giving a certain number of ratings and 
reviews.   

Passive to Active Producers 
Students  become  passive producers  when  going 
through the process of building their app for the 
first time.  As they are struggling to figure things 
out, they may not feel like they know enough to 
share,  and  may  be  frequently  reaching  out  to 
others when they get stuck or have questions.   

Once students successfully publish their app, we 
see  many  of  them  moving  into  the  active 
producer  role  where  they  want  to  share  what 

they  have  learned  and  help  others.    In  some 
cases, we’ve seen students coming to the lab on 
their own time (skipping work and other classes) 
after  their  project  was  completed  just  to  help 
others.   

In  several  extreme  cases,  numerous  students 
had made several apps on their own but  helped 
fellow  students  make 
theirs.  These  self-
appointed  Teaching  Assistants  became  close 
friends  and  continued  their  association  in  other 
aspects of their lives.  

Once a student has their app certified, then their 
community shifts to include the store consumers 
that  download  their  apps.    This  shift  is  even 
more  noticeable  as 
the  developer  starts 
receiving  comments,  ratings  and  reviews  on 
their  apps  suggesting  fixes,  improvements  and 
additional  features.  In  this  “store”  community, 
the  users  of  the  students’  apps  participate  in 
development  by 
first  downloading  (passive 
consumer)  apps,  but  as  they  comment  and 
suggest  new 
features  they  become  active 
consumers.  It  is  the  existence  of  this  active 
consumer  role  held  by  retail  consumers  that 
makes  an  app  published  in  a  formal  store  more 
like  a  service  and  less  like  a  product  (Marks, 
2014).   

12. CONCLUSION 

The  app  development  module  has  proven  to  be 
of high interest to many of the students enrolled 
in  survey  Management  Information  Systems 
courses,  even  among  those  who  are  not 
planning  on  pursuing  a  CIS  major  or  minor.  
While  there  is  the  potential  for  friction  when 
dealing  with  developer  store  processes  and 
certification,  students  learn  valuable  lessons 
when  they  are  accountable  to  an  inflexible 
commercial  app  store.    The  students’  real-world 
experiences give them valuable insights into the 
benefits  of  a  technology  career,  and  start 
developing 
design, 
development,  marketing  and  strategy  that  add 
value to their personal resumes and portfolios.

in 

We have found that most courses have room for 
the  addition  of  a  high-value,  two  week  project, 
and  in  many  cases  it  can  replace  other  projects 
that  have  become  dated  and  less  relevant.  As 
we  continue  to  refine  the  way  we  manage  and 
assess  app  development,  we  also  expect  the 
tools  and  processes  to  become  easier  to  use.  
There  is  every  indication  that  mobile  apps  are 
going to be an increasingly important technology 
going  forward.    Providing  students  with  hands-

Abstract  

 

 
A  large  survey  Management  Information  Systems  course  required  of  all  business  major  included  a 
project where students designed, developed and published (in a real online store) one or more mobile 
apps  using  no-code  tools.    Extra  credit  was  offered  for  publishing  multiple  apps,  improving/updating 
the  published  apps,  and  several  other  activities  relating  to  the  online  store  community.    Student 
attitudes about technology majors before and after the project were measured.  Results indicate that 
the  real-world  nature  of  the  project  and  online  store  community  interaction  resulted  in  high 
satisfaction  with  the  project  and  positively  changed  perceptions  and  intent  to  pursue  technology 
career paths in more than twenty-five percent of the participants.

increased interest in pursuing CIS as a major or 
minor  after  completing  the  project.  Using  a 
combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
measures,  we  show  that  app  development  is 
effective  in  teaching  important  business  skills 
and influencing them to consider CIS as a major 
or minor.  

2.  MOTIVATION 

in 

these  courses 

Survey  MIS  courses  are  typically  a  required 
course  in  undergraduate  business  majors.    The 
students  enrolled 
learn 
concepts  of  office  automation  and  enterprise 
computing.    Key  skill  components  are  Microsoft 
Excel  and  Access,  which  are  prerequisites  for 
subsequent  business  courses.  Other  projects 
may  include  designing  a  simple  web  page  or  a 
short paper on an emerging technology trend.   

Our  experience  over  the  course  of  many  years 
has  been  that  this  course  does  little  to  attract 
students  to  CIS  as  a  career  or  retain  those  that 
were pursuing the major.  The recent availability 
of  no-code  app  development  tools  has  created 
an 
without 
programming  knowledge  to  make  simple,  but 
high quality apps.   

opportunity 

students 

for 

Building  and  publishing  an  app  gives  students 
real-world  experience  in  most  of  the  software 
development  processes  within  the  scope  of  a 
single  project  requiring  approximately  ten  to 
twenty  homework  hours  for  most  students  to 
complete.    Students  find  the  context  of  a 
consumer-focused 
project  much  more 
understandable  than  enterprise  concepts.    In 
addition,  the  marketing  aspects  of  the  project 
give  students  a  way  to  apply  a  broad-range  of 
business  skills  in  a  real-world  scenario  where 
they  are  able  to  get  feedback  from  both  the 
store  vetting  processes  and  consumers  who  use 
the app store.   

Since  their  experience  is  “real”,  it  provides 
successful students with a significant experience 
to  put  on  their  resume  which  is  an  important 
differentiator  with  recruiters.    More  importantly, 
students  are  able  to  experience  a  number  of 
dimensions  of  software  development  including 
design,  art,  testing,  development,  iteration, 
publishing  and  marketing.  When  experienced  in 
a live, integrative experience students learn that 
software  development 
can  be  engaging, 
fulfilling,  important  and  impactful;  personally, 
professionally,  and  even  societally.   Experiences 
like

technology  careers  and  influence  a  significant

3.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

The  belief  that  computer  programming  and  the 
creation  of  technology  artifacts  should  not  be 
the  sole  domain  of  a  few  with  arcane  skills  and 
training  has  been  shared  by  educators  for 
decades  (Papert,  1980).    In  practice  however, 
attempts  to  bring  programming  to  the  masses 
has  tended  to  refute  this  belief;  with  male 
“nerds”  and  “geeks”  being  stereotypes  for  a 
special  class  of individuals  with  high  intelligence 
but  lacking  social  skills;  an  unfortunate-but-
necessary  trade-off  required  to  be  successful  in 
programming.   

While  early  efforts  to  teach  programming  to 
elementary  school  children  were  enthusiastically 
and broadly received (Papert, 1980), today most 
computer  literacy  efforts  focus  on  the  computer 
as a facilitator to accomplishing other tasks such 
as writing papers or producing presentations and 
multi-media.  Papert  (1980)  describes  three 
reasons  why  early 
in  wide-spread 
programming  education  has  waned:  early 
programming languages were difficult to use and 
learn,  programming  activities  were  focused  on 
logic and algorithm creation rather than subjects 
that  broad  populations  of  students  were 
interested 
in,  and  programing  was  often 
introduced  in  contexts  where  there  was  little 
help  if  things  went  wrong  or  to  encourage 
deeper exploration when things went right.  

interest 

frequently 

for  non-majors 

In  higher  education,  computer  science  (CS) 
courses 
feature 
traditional  languages  such  as  Java  or  C++  but 
with  less  depth  or  complexity.    These  courses 
have  proven  to  be  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the 
needs of a majority of students enrolled in them 
(Guzdial,  2003).    Goldweber  et  al.  (2013) 
identified  that  traditional  CS  projects  seem  to 
focus  on  trite  or  childish  themes  or  problems 
and  result  in  many  students  leaving  the  CS 
major  to  do  things  that  seem  to  them  to  be 
more  important  and  impactful  (i.e.,  “that  have 
the power to do good and make a difference”).  

In recent years attempts to create programming 
environments  that  are  exciting  and  entertaining 
to  larger  student  audiences  have  seen  some 
success  (Resnick  et  al.,  2009).    However,  even 
though  students  find  these  tools  and  courses 
that use them fun and fulfilling, they continue to 
fail  in  convincing  most  students  to  seriously 
consider technology majors and careers (Davies,

A  new  paradigm  is  emerging  now  that  adds  a 
social dimension to technology creation. Through 
online communities of developers, young people 
are 
finding  an  additional  social  “hook”  to 
encourage 
skill 
development  and  career  momentum  (Monroy-
  Monroy-
Hernandez  &  Resnick,  2008). 
Hernandez  et  al. 
these 
communities  have  four  types  of  member  roles: 
passive  consumer,  active  consumer,  passive 
producer, and active producer.  In this study, we 
identify  the  retail  mobile  device  “app  store”  as 
such  a  community  and  identify  parallel  member 
roles  such  as  the  passive  consumer,  active 
consumer,  and  active  producer.    In  fact,  we 
posit  that  the  retail  app  store  provides  app 
developers  with  similar  levels  of  engagement, 
feedback  and  personal  satisfaction  as 
the 
developer-focused  communities  such  as  Scratch 
Online Community or App Inventor communities 
(Honig,  2013).  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2013)  describes 
the  “design  studio”  where  public  visibility 
provides  a  richer,  more  nuanced  feedback  and 
learning  both  from  self  and  peer’s  work.    This 
type  of  feedback  has  proven  to  be  valuable  in 
courses where each student is required to create 
a  unique  product  and  where  a  highly  structured 
grading  rubric  is  too  coarse  to  assess  quality.  
Similarly,  Christudason 
that 
“Research  indicates  that  peer  learning  activities 
typically  result  in:  (a)  team-building  spirit  and 
more  supportive 
relationships;  (b)  greater 
psychological  well-being,  social  competence, 
communication  skills  and  self-esteem;  and  (c) 
higher  achievement  and  greater  productivity  in 
terms of enhanced learning outcomes.”  

(2003) 

found 

Lave  &  Wenger  (1991)  suggest  that  learning  is 
fundamentally  a  social  process,  and  learners 
start  at  the  periphery  and  move  towards  closer 
relationships  to  practitioners  as  their  skills 
improve. We concur and posit that a public “app 
store”  provides  much  of  the  same  source  of 
nuanced feedback to its contributing developers, 
including  student  developers.    Stokes  (2013) 
suggests  that  failure  is  an  essential  part  of 
learning,  and  that  app  stores  provide  a  real 
medium  where  failure  is  normal  and  expected 
(due to the many rules and tests), a place where 
errors  are  accurately  and  quickly  identified  in  a 
non-partisan  manner  (“failing  fast”),  and  are 
just  as  quickly  remedied,  providing  a  rich 
learning environment for students.  

4. COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The  course  that  was  the  subject  of  this  study  is 
offered at a large state college with a wide range 
of  demographics  and  student  preparation.  The 
course  teaching  app  development  is  a  required, 
ten-week  300-level  course  typically  taken  by 
students  with  sophomore  and  junior  standing.  
Fall enrollments may be as high as 450 students 
with  Winter/Spring  enrollments  slightly  lower.  
The  course  is  taught  in  a  large  lecture-hall 
setting  with  up  to  75  students  per  class.    Class 
periods  are  110  minutes  twice  per  week  and 
tend to focus on textbook content.  

The  CIS  department  does  not  have  a  dedicated 
lab,  and  public  labs  do  not  have  the  software 
typically  used  for  app  development.    Most 
students  have  access  to  personal  computing 
devices,  of  which  approximately  60  percent  are 
PC’s  and  40  percent  Apple/Mac  products.    The 
college  has  eight  business  concentrations,  of 
which  Computer  Information  Systems  is  one  of 
the smaller concentrations.  A variety of popular 
textbooks  have  been  used  over  the  years  and 
the  textbook  currently  being  used  is  widely 
known.  

5. THE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT MODULE 

The  app  development  project  was  taught  as  a 
formal  one-week  module  within  the  course  with 
additional  time  outside  of  class  for  students  to 
complete  their  projects,  pass  store  submission 
processes,  make  revisions  and  get  customer 
feedback.  Two lectures complement the hands-
on  app  development  project.  One 
lecture 
demonstrates  how  to  make  an  app  along  with 
app marketing and store strategy.  In addition to 
the formal classes, special proctored “lab hours” 
are  offered  where  students  can  work  on  their 
apps  with  help  readily  available.    The  live 
presentations  were  supplemented  with  a  set  of 
detailed  “how  to”  videos  covering  every  aspect 
of  app  development  and  submission.  Most 
students  took  advantage  of  the  videos  or  asked 
colleagues  in  class  for  help  rather  than  coming 
to the office hours and labs.  

For 
the  hands-on  project,  students  used 
browser-based  tools  to  create  a  basic  app  with 
either custom content they provided (pictures or 
text)  or  they  curated  real  time  data  feeds  from 
blogs,  web-searches,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Pinterest, 
Facebook,  and  Twitter.    Students  used  photo-
editing tools to create icons, backgrounds, logos, 
and  marketplace  images.    Students  had  to 
create a publisher account in the store and write 
the marketplace description of their app applying

the  strategies  and  techniques  covered  in  the 
marketing and store strategy lectures.   

Completed apps were submitted to the store and 
had to pass the store certification requirements. 
If  the  app  failed  certification,  students  had  to 
correct the issues and resubmit.  At its simplest, 
students  could  make  an  app  in  under  an  hour.  
Creating the art assets for their marketplace and 
writing  the  description  took  at  least  another 
hour.  We  observed  that  many  students  got 
caught  up  in  the  project  and  spent  more  than 
the  minimum  amount  time  fine-tuning  images 
and  their  description.    On  average,  students 
spent  about  six  hours,  but  that  average  had  a 
pretty broad curve. 

Successfully  certifying  an  app  in  the  store  was 
required  to  get  full  credit  for  project,  and  they 
had  approximately  ten  days  to  complete  the 
assignment.  They  could  earn  extra  credit  up  to 
an  amount  equal  to  the  original  assignment  for 
completing  a  number of  follow-on  tasks  such  as 
upgrading  their  app  and  having  the  second 
release  certified,  making  a  second  app  either  in 
the  same  store  or  publishing  the  same  app  into 
a  different  store,  getting  a  certain  number  of 
downloads,  or  earning  a  certain  amount  of 
money. 
  Many  students  who  missed  the  
deadline  for  the  first  app  took  advantage  of  the 
extra  credit  in  order to  protect  their  grades  and 
a  few  had  enough  interest  that  they  completed 
some  or  even  all  of  the  extra  credit  activities 
even  though  they  didn’t  need  it.    At  the 
conclusion  of  the  project  students  were  given 
the  option  of  presenting  their  apps  to the  class, 
including  their  store  analytics.  This  presentation 
session  added  yet  another  dimension  of  realism 
to  the  project  as  students  discussed  download 
trends, countries and age demographics of their 
users, and even their marketing strategies.   

For this project we used Microsoft’s phone store 
and  Windows  app  store  since  they  provide 
students  free  developer  accounts,  and  our 
campus has local reps that helped with technical 
issues  in  real  time  while  the  project  was  being 
formally  completed.  Microsoft  has  an  easy-but-
powerful app development tool (App Studio) that 
does not require programming knowledge, which 
worked  well  for the  project.    The  local  Microsoft 
rep was able to contact the team who developed 
the  tool,  making  problem-solving  more  likely 
than  other  platforms  that  did  not  engage  on 
campus locally. 

 

6. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

The data for this research was obtained through 
anonymous  surveys  given  to  students  via  the 
Blackboard  Learning  Management  System  and 
offered  as  part  of  the  project  workflow  in  one 
MIS  course  with  71  students.    Participation  in 
the  survey  was  strongly  encouraged  by  the 
instructor  but  was  not  graded.  Even  though  the 
survey was anonymous, Blackboard can indicate 
who has taken the survey.  All survey results are 
reported 
individual 
answers  are  not  identified.    Two  surveys  were 
given,  one  after  the  first  week  of  the  project 
(before  the  final  deliverable  was  due)  and  one 
after  the  students  had  apps  certified  and  in  the 
store with a chance to submit revisions.

students  surveyed,  59  (87%)  did  not  have  a 
minor.  Table 1 below illustrates the distribution 
of the business majors represented in the class. 

Female/Male Makeup 
Female  representation  in  CIS  related  jobs  has 
declined  over  the  last  two  decades.    Ashcroft 
and Blithe (2009) note that in 1991, 36% of the 
IT  workforce  was  female  and  in  2008  it  was 
down  to  25%.    In  the  academic  environment, 
Soe,  Guthrie,  Yakura,  and  Hwang  (2012)  noted 
a  decline  in  female  enrollment  in  CIS-related 
majors.    Soe  et  al.,  (2012)  stated  that  in  Fall 
2009,  female  enrollment  in  the  CIS  program  at 
California  State  Polytechnic  University,  Pomona 
was  16%  and  fell  to  11%  the  following  year.

taking the MIS class. 

 8. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE DATA 

Our sophomore/junior level MIS class is required 
of  all  business  majors.    Over  91%  of  the 
students  were  outside  of  Computer  Information 
Systems major.  In addition, the class was close 
to being 50% Male and 50% Female which is not 
indicative  of  traditional  Computer  Information 
Systems  based  classes.    Regardless  of  gender, 
the majority of students did not have experience 
with mobile app or Windows app development.   

Prior  to  this  project  the  students  in  this  class 
could  be  considered  mobile  app  users  rather 
than developers/creators of apps.

or  agreed  that  they  were  considering  CIS  as  a 
possible  major  or  adding  a  CIS  minor  after 
completing the mobile app project. 
 

Career Implications 
Figure  4  illustrates  the  career  goal  impact  the 
project had on students.  Regardless of whether 
they  wanted  to  change  their  major  or  add  a 
minor,  51%  either  strongly  agreed  or  agreed 
that  creating  a  mobile  app  changed  their 
perception  of  the  potential  of  app  development 
in helping them meet their career goals.

the  store.    Extra  credit  was  awarded  to  those 
students  that  issued  a  second  release  of  their 
app  in  the  store  of  which  30  (60%)  did.    Even 
with  the  difficulties  encountered  when  creating 
the  app,  71%  of  the  students  are  more  inclined 
to create additional apps in the future.

she had no experience developing a mobile app.  
In fact, she did not own a smartphone.  With her 
four-year old daughter in tow, the student came 
to the office hours being held in a computer lab 
to discuss beginning the project.  The discussion 
did  not  initially  start  with  the  technology  that 
would  be  used  but  rather  what  topic/subject 
would  be  fun  to  focus  on  when  developing  her

10. QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS 

As  part  of  the  survey,  one  of  the  open-ended 
questions  students  were  asked  was  “what  did 
you  enjoy  most  about  this  project?”.    Almost 
every  respondent,  with  no  external  prompts, 
used the words “creative” or “creativity” in their 
positive  responses.    A  sampling  of  verbatim 
responses is: 

“Coming up with the idea of something I 
enjoyed doing and then figuring how to link it to 
sites and videos that I visit.” 

 
to create, and making it into a reality.” 

“Getting  to  think  of  what  app  I  wanted 

“I enjoyed the freedom of creativity that 
 
was  involved  with  the  project.   There  were  no 
limitations  on  what  we  could  or  couldn't  do,  so 

that  made  it  much  easier  to  be  interested  and 
involved in the success of this project.” 

 
“I  really  enjoy  the  opportunity  to  create 
a web app and find out ways of making your app 
successful.” 

 
“I  really  liked  the  designing  of  the  app 
the  most.  I  also  enjoyed  thinking  about  this 
project as one starting a company.” 

 
“I  thought  that  the  project  was  a  new 
experience and it is something I found extremely 
useful. In the world of technology today creating 
a  mobile  app  can  be  a  great  skill  that  you  can 
apply to a job. “ 

 
“The creative aspect of making your own 
app,  the  process  of  learning  it,  and  seeing  your 
creation come to life.” 

 

“Watching the project come to life.” 

Another  open-ended  questions  was  “What  did 
you  enjoy  the  least  or  find  the  most  frustrating 
with this project?”.  Two dominant themes were 
evident in the answers: one related to the short 
deadline  for  the  first  project,  and  the  other  to 
getting through store certification.   

The  short  deadline  was  imposed  because  our 
experience shows that no matter how much time 
you  give  students,  most  will  wait  until  there  is 
just  enough  time  before  starting.    We  wanted 
the  students  to  get  through  the  certification 
process  early  so  they  could  have  time  for  user 
feedback and to submit updates.   

The  second  set  of  frustrations  related  to  the 
store certification processes, some of which was 
not  the  students’  fault.  During  the  project  the 
Microsoft  Windows  stores  were  going  through 
rapid  and  significant  redesigns,  and  at  times 
certain  browsers  weren’t  supported,  or  there 
were  unexplained  file  upload  issues.  Some 
quality issues existed with respect to the human 
testers  not  providing  detailed  feedback.    While 
all  of  these  were  eventually  resolved,  it  did 
understandably  cause  students  frustration.    In 
some  cases  it  appeared  that  students  were  not 
used  to  being  accountable  to  an  unsympathetic 
third-party’s rules and requirements that in their 
mind  were  trivial,  such  as  the  requirement  to 
not  have  any  visible  borders  on  screen  capture 
images. 

A sampling of verbatim responses is: 

“Getting  a  certified  file  caused  me  the 
most frustration. The error messages didn't have 
a  clear  solution  and  it  was  extremely  hard 
because  I  had  a  Mac.  I  think  that  the  project  is

opportunities.” 

it  comes 

“Not  knowing  if  my  app  was 
going  to  get  certified  or  not.  Waiting  time.” 

 

“The  certification  part  caused  me 
frustration.  I hated waiting 3-5 days for my app 
to  either  be 
  approved  or  denied 
certification.   The  Microsoft  tester  was  not  clear 
on what was wrong with my app.” 

 

 

“The  certification  process  was  annoying, 
because  I  kept  getting  denied  and  the  errors  it 
would  give  me  were  not  specific  enough  for 
beginners  to  understand  where  the  problem 
needed to be fixed.” 

11. DEVELOPER COMMUNITY ROLES 

As  suggested  by  Monroy-Hernandez  et  al. 
(2008) and Lave & Wenger (1991), we observed 
students  forming  into  communities  of  practice 
and evolving through a variety of role stages.   

students 

Passive Consumers 
Initially  most 
start  as  passive 
consumers.  We  encouraged  this  role  by  having 
students  browse  the  app  stores  to  see  what  is 
out  there  and  to  identify  aspects  of  successful 
apps.   

We  also  encouraged  students  to  seek  out  apps 
that potentially do what they are thinking about 
doing  and thereby  identify  potential  competitors 
and  ways  in  which  they  could  improve  upon 
existing apps.   

Active Consumers 
We don’t see the active consumer role come into 
play  until  a  bit  later.    Once  students  started 
publishing  their  apps,  we  invited  them  to  rate 
and  review  each  other’s  apps  both  to  help drive 
downloads  and  as  a  show  of  mutual  support.  
We  incented  this  behavior  by  offering  extra 
credit for giving a certain number of ratings and 
reviews.   

Passive to Active Producers 
Students  become  passive producers  when  going 
through the process of building their app for the 
first time.  As they are struggling to figure things 
out, they may not feel like they know enough to 
share,  and  may  be  frequently  reaching  out  to 
others when they get stuck or have questions.   

Once students successfully publish their app, we 
see  many  of  them  moving  into  the  active 
producer  role  where  they  want  to  share  what 

they  have  learned  and  help  others.    In  some 
cases, we’ve seen students coming to the lab on 
their own time (skipping work and other classes) 
after  their  project  was  completed  just  to  help 
others.   

In  several  extreme  cases,  numerous  students 
had made several apps on their own but  helped 
fellow  students  make 
theirs.  These  self-
appointed  Teaching  Assistants  became  close 
friends  and  continued  their  association  in  other 
aspects of their lives.  

Once a student has their app certified, then their 
community shifts to include the store consumers 
that  download  their  apps.    This  shift  is  even 
more  noticeable  as 
the  developer  starts 
receiving  comments,  ratings  and  reviews  on 
their  apps  suggesting  fixes,  improvements  and 
additional  features.  In  this  “store”  community, 
the  users  of  the  students’  apps  participate  in 
development  by 
first  downloading  (passive 
consumer)  apps,  but  as  they  comment  and 
suggest  new 
features  they  become  active 
consumers.  It  is  the  existence  of  this  active 
consumer  role  held  by  retail  consumers  that 
makes  an  app  published  in  a  formal  store  more 
like  a  service  and  less  like  a  product  (Marks, 
2014).   

12. CONCLUSION 

The  app  development  module  has  proven  to  be 
of high interest to many of the students enrolled 
in  survey  Management  Information  Systems 
courses,  even  among  those  who  are  not 
planning  on  pursuing  a  CIS  major  or  minor.  
While  there  is  the  potential  for  friction  when 
dealing  with  developer  store  processes  and 
certification,  students  learn  valuable  lessons 
when  they  are  accountable  to  an  inflexible 
commercial  app  store.    The  students’  real-world 
experiences give them valuable insights into the 
benefits  of  a  technology  career,  and  start 
developing 
design, 
development,  marketing  and  strategy  that  add 
value to their personal resumes and portfolios.

in 

We have found that most courses have room for 
the  addition  of  a  high-value,  two  week  project, 
and  in  many  cases  it  can  replace  other  projects 
that  have  become  dated  and  less  relevant.  As 
we  continue  to  refine  the  way  we  manage  and 
assess  app  development,  we  also  expect  the 
tools  and  processes  to  become  easier  to  use.  
There  is  every  indication  that  mobile  apps  are 
going to be an increasingly important technology 
going  forward.    Providing  students  with  hands-
on experiences in the survey MIS course imparts
