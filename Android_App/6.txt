Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to  spread CPR education to the public and to  promote the 
effects  of  training  using  an  app  design  that  applied  the  gamification  theory  based  on 
UNITY3D engine. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the advancement of 
the online smart SNG market through the promotion of the net functional effects of games by 
applying  the  gamification  theory  on  various  functional  games,  and  by  using  UNITY3D  to 
convert  web-based  games  and  contents  into  ‘IOS’  or  ‘ANDROID’  and  widely  developing 
them  into  smartphone-use  services.  Also  the  clients  in  community  would  likely  be  equipped 
with  an  ability  to  respond  to  emergency  situations,  by  receiving  CPR  training  in  a  fun  and 
easy manner at anytime, anywhere.

1. Introduction 

Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  is  an  emergency  procedure,  performed  in  an 
effort  to  manually  preserve  intact  brain  function  until  further  measures  are  taken  to 
restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in cardiac arrest [1]. 

Cardiac  arrests  occur  suddenly  and  the  patients  are  not  usually  able  to  call  for 
assistance  on  their  own.  4-5  minutes  after  a  cardiac  arrest  brain  damage  starts  to  take 
place;  therefore,  a  quick  first  aid  action  by  a  witness  is  essential   [2-3].  With  each 
minute  of  delay  in  defibrillation  the  survival  rate  can  decrease   by  7%-10%,  however, 
this can be reduced by 2.5%-5% per minute if a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 
performed. In cases where a witness performs a CPR, the survival rate can be 2 -3 times 
higher  [4].  The  rate  of  CPRs  being  performed  by  the  general  public  in  South  Korea  is 
3.1%,  which  is  very  low  when  compared  to  those  of  Sweden  at  77%,  the  United 
States37.4%,  and  Japan  at  12.0%  [5].  The  rate  at  which  a  patient  suffering  from  an 
acute  cardiac  arrest  survives  the  transport  and  is  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  Korea  is 
9.9%  and  the  rate  for  a  live  discharge  from  hospital  is  only  3.0%;  moreover,  in 
particular, the rate for a normal brain function is a mere 0.9%. Whereas, in the case of 
the United States, the rates are 26.4% for a live admission to the hospital, 10.3 % for a 
live  discharge,  and  7.7%  for  a  normal  brain  function.  In  other  words,  whether  or  not  a 
CPR is performed by a witness on a patient suffering a cardiac arrest occurring outside 
the  hospital  becomes  an  important  factor  that  determines  the  patient’s  prognosis   [6]. 
Currently, in the United States and Europe, the encouragement and support for CPR and 
first aid training for the general public are actively being pursued  [6].

In  2008,  in  Korea  as  well,  a  legislation  for  the  installation  and  use  of  automated 
external defibrillators (AED) was put in place, and since 2010, how-to-use training has 
been underway and CPR training is being conducted through the health care training in 
schools  [7].  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  CPR  training  is  optional  and  not  mandatory 
and due to other factors, including the lack of professional teachers, inadequate training 
materials and facilities, the lack of interests, etc., there exists a problem of CPR training 
for  the  general  public  not  being  expanded  sufficiently  [4,  8-9].  In  addition,  since  CPR 
entails  a  layperson  performing  an  unfamiliar  medical  procedure  in  an  emergency 
situation,  what  is  required  in  CPR  training  is  not  just  a  simple  transfer  of  knowledge 
and  skills  but  also  a  repetitive  training  that  instills  self -confidence  and  self-assurance 
about  one’s  own  ability  while  overcoming  the  psychological -social  stress  factors  that 
accompany performing CPRs. Therefore, this study proposes the following: the current 
training infrastructure,  which is insufficient for spreading  CPR training for the  general 
public, needs to be complemented; publicity and interests need to be strengthened; and 
a CPR training method that ensures confidence and assurance needs to be devised.  

SNG  is  a  game  that’s  rapidly  growing  together  with  the  popularization  of 
smartphones on the SNS level, and it is a service that fuses the advantages of SNS such 
as  Twitter,  blogs,  Facebook,  etc.  with  the  enjoyment  of  games  [6].  The  unique  feature 
of  SNG  is  that  it  is  a  new  communication  means  that  utilizes   the  social  relationships 
built in SN where networking can be achieved while enjoying games with a number of 
gamers,  and  it  is  making  advances  while  showing  a  potential  for  the  game  space  to  be 
expanded  into  the  social  space.  It  can  be  said  that  it’s  an  effective  form  of  game,  in 
which,  by  evolving  from  the  existing  games  that  emphasize  personal  accomplishments 
and  rewards,  the  interest  level  is  increased  because  of  the  interaction  among  social 
activity  players  becomes  an  important  element  of  game  playing,  and  participation  by 
the  many  is  induced.  Such  an  SNG  can  be  applied  for  CPR  training  in  that,  by 
combining  a  variety  of  realistic  materials  such  as  texts  usable  in  smartphones,  videos, 
sounds, etc., and it can provide data and assistance in promoting correct understanding 
of  CPR  by  the  general  public  [6].  Furthermore,  it  is  expected  that  the  games  that  are 
associated  with  text  service  and  SNS  service  of  the  smartphones  will  promote 
interaction among the applicable subjects and  provide increased interests  and  publicity 
benefits for CPR training [6]. 

 “Gamification”  is  utilized  as  a  process  that  solves  problems  through  game -like 
thinking  and  game  mechanics  while  facilitating  participation  by  the  users.  In 
gamification,  through  the  problem-solving  activity  of  game  stories  with  a  play-minded 
approach  and  through  fun,  etc.,  voluntary  participation  by  the  users  is  encouraged  and 
immersion  is  enabled  [6].  This  increases  problem-solving  skills  through  a  step-by-step 
learning  and,  through  the  functional  characteristics  of  games  that  enable  achievi ng  a 
clear sense of purpose of rules and strategies, induces the subjects to solve problems on 
their own and brings out their participation and positive behavior. The strong  points of 
gamification,  which  clearly  identify  the  purpose,  tasks,  behaviors,  etc.   that  need  to  be 
achieved  and  which  provide  rewards  when  these  are  achieved,  will  facilitate  the 
subjects  to  recognize  and  deal  with  the  situations  that  they  are  facing  in  the  culture 
where  individuals  are  living,  and  the  elements  of  fun,  scores,  level -ups  and  ranking 
competitions are deemed to be able to play the role of sustaining voluntary participation 
by  inducing  the  internal  and  external  motivations  of  the  subjects   [10].  Therefore,  the 
application  of  the  gamification  theory  on  CPR  games  is  expected  to  use  an  important 
factor that sustains the effects of training and participation.

2. Development of Multiplatforms that Use UNITY3D Engine 

In order to produce multiplatform games, for each platform, all the different settings 
of the system must be controllable. In this paper, the use of Unity3D engine is proposed 
based on the reason that codes can be written with C#, JavaScript and Boo, the Unity3D 
engine  was  developed  as  a  C#-  and  Mono-based  code.  The  run-time  part  of  the  engine 
was  developed  with  C++  and  Microsoft  NET  API,  and  the  editor  program  was 
developed with C#. As for the script, it cannot be modified directly in Unity, and it can 
be modified in script editors, such as Mono Develop, etc., that support Unity. Although 
Visual  Studio  also  supports  through  plug-ins,  it  lacks  overall  debugging  functionality 
and, in the Express version, debugging is not supported. In the case of Unity3, not only 
simple  physics  engines  or  shaders,  but  also  realistically,  all  conditions,  including 
network  or  terrain  manipulation,  audio,  video,  animations,  etc.,  are  supported.  By 
converting  web-based  games  and  contents  developed  using  Unity  3D  into  'IOS'  or 
'ANDROID,' they can be serviced as smartphone-use (Figure 1) [10-11]. 
 

Figure 1. Multiplatforms engine; Unity3D 

 

Unity3Dsupports  3  type  of  script  languages:  Java  Script,  C#  and  Boo.  All  three  are 
capable  of  the  same  fast  interaction,  capable  of  utilizing  .NET  libraries,  and  all  three 
support  databases,  standard  expressions,  XML,  networking,  etc.  Even  though  scripting 
is normally considered to  be limited and slow,  Unity3  operates with  very fast iteration 
times and, by pairing up with a compilation of easy native code, becomes almost as fast 
as the C++ level. In addition, the implementation of Java Script for Unity3D operates  at 
the same speed as C# or Boo. Game logic is executed in the .NET platform Mono open 
source;  which  provides  a  best-in-the-world  programming  environment  that  offers  the 
best speed and flexibility [6].  

A  single  line  of  code  is  sufficient  for  moving,  rotating  and  scaling  an  object.  The 
replication, removal and changing of the properties are, of course, the same. Everything can 
be directly referenced via the names, layers, tags, similarity, or touch,  etc. The functionality 
of  Unity3D  is  integrated  with  all  the  MonoDevelop,  in  license.  As  shown  in  Figure  2,  this 
would mean that Unity3D would have IDE of the highest level [6]. 

Unity3D  is  automatically  synchronized  with  MonoDevelop  and  as  well  as  with  Visual 
Studio.  All  internal  references  are  set  so  as  to  attain  a  complete  auto-completion  in  the 
internal API. Unity3D is capable of browser communication with Web Player autonomously. 
The  HTML  page  containing  Unity  Web  Player  contents  are  able  to  communicate  with  the

Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to  spread CPR education to the public and to  promote the 
effects  of  training  using  an  app  design  that  applied  the  gamification  theory  based  on 
UNITY3D engine. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the advancement of 
the online smart SNG market through the promotion of the net functional effects of games by 
applying  the  gamification  theory  on  various  functional  games,  and  by  using  UNITY3D  to 
convert  web-based  games  and  contents  into  ‘IOS’  or  ‘ANDROID’  and  widely  developing 
them  into  smartphone-use  services.  Also  the  clients  in  community  would  likely  be  equipped 
with  an  ability  to  respond  to  emergency  situations,  by  receiving  CPR  training  in  a  fun  and 
easy manner at anytime, anywhere.

1. Introduction 

Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  is  an  emergency  procedure,  performed  in  an 
effort  to  manually  preserve  intact  brain  function  until  further  measures  are  taken  to 
restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in cardiac arrest [1]. 

Cardiac  arrests  occur  suddenly  and  the  patients  are  not  usually  able  to  call  for 
assistance  on  their  own.  4-5  minutes  after  a  cardiac  arrest  brain  damage  starts  to  take 
place;  therefore,  a  quick  first  aid  action  by  a  witness  is  essential   [2-3].  With  each 
minute  of  delay  in  defibrillation  the  survival  rate  can  decrease   by  7%-10%,  however, 
this can be reduced by 2.5%-5% per minute if a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 
performed. In cases where a witness performs a CPR, the survival rate can be 2 -3 times 
higher  [4].  The  rate  of  CPRs  being  performed  by  the  general  public  in  South  Korea  is 
3.1%,  which  is  very  low  when  compared  to  those  of  Sweden  at  77%,  the  United 
States37.4%,  and  Japan  at  12.0%  [5].  The  rate  at  which  a  patient  suffering  from  an 
acute  cardiac  arrest  survives  the  transport  and  is  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  Korea  is 
9.9%  and  the  rate  for  a  live  discharge  from  hospital  is  only  3.0%;  moreover,  in 
particular, the rate for a normal brain function is a mere 0.9%. Whereas, in the case of 
the United States, the rates are 26.4% for a live admission to the hospital, 10.3 % for a 
live  discharge,  and  7.7%  for  a  normal  brain  function.  In  other  words,  whether  or  not  a 
CPR is performed by a witness on a patient suffering a cardiac arrest occurring outside 
the  hospital  becomes  an  important  factor  that  determines  the  patient’s  prognosis   [6]. 
Currently, in the United States and Europe, the encouragement and support for CPR and 
first aid training for the general public are actively being pursued  [6].

In  2008,  in  Korea  as  well,  a  legislation  for  the  installation  and  use  of  automated 
external defibrillators (AED) was put in place, and since 2010, how-to-use training has 
been underway and CPR training is being conducted through the health care training in 
schools  [7].  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  CPR  training  is  optional  and  not  mandatory 
and due to other factors, including the lack of professional teachers, inadequate training 
materials and facilities, the lack of interests, etc., there exists a problem of CPR training 
for  the  general  public  not  being  expanded  sufficiently  [4,  8-9].  In  addition,  since  CPR 
entails  a  layperson  performing  an  unfamiliar  medical  procedure  in  an  emergency 
situation,  what  is  required  in  CPR  training  is  not  just  a  simple  transfer  of  knowledge 
and  skills  but  also  a  repetitive  training  that  instills  self -confidence  and  self-assurance 
about  one’s  own  ability  while  overcoming  the  psychological -social  stress  factors  that 
accompany performing CPRs. Therefore, this study proposes the following: the current 
training infrastructure,  which is insufficient for spreading  CPR training for the  general 
public, needs to be complemented; publicity and interests need to be strengthened; and 
a CPR training method that ensures confidence and assurance needs to be devised.  

SNG  is  a  game  that’s  rapidly  growing  together  with  the  popularization  of 
smartphones on the SNS level, and it is a service that fuses the advantages of SNS such 
as  Twitter,  blogs,  Facebook,  etc.  with  the  enjoyment  of  games  [6].  The  unique  feature 
of  SNG  is  that  it  is  a  new  communication  means  that  utilizes   the  social  relationships 
built in SN where networking can be achieved while enjoying games with a number of 
gamers,  and  it  is  making  advances  while  showing  a  potential  for  the  game  space  to  be 
expanded  into  the  social  space.  It  can  be  said  that  it’s  an  effective  form  of  game,  in 
which,  by  evolving  from  the  existing  games  that  emphasize  personal  accomplishments 
and  rewards,  the  interest  level  is  increased  because  of  the  interaction  among  social 
activity  players  becomes  an  important  element  of  game  playing,  and  participation  by 
the  many  is  induced.  Such  an  SNG  can  be  applied  for  CPR  training  in  that,  by 
combining  a  variety  of  realistic  materials  such  as  texts  usable  in  smartphones,  videos, 
sounds, etc., and it can provide data and assistance in promoting correct understanding 
of  CPR  by  the  general  public  [6].  Furthermore,  it  is  expected  that  the  games  that  are 
associated  with  text  service  and  SNS  service  of  the  smartphones  will  promote 
interaction among the applicable subjects and  provide increased interests  and  publicity 
benefits for CPR training [6]. 

 “Gamification”  is  utilized  as  a  process  that  solves  problems  through  game -like 
thinking  and  game  mechanics  while  facilitating  participation  by  the  users.  In 
gamification,  through  the  problem-solving  activity  of  game  stories  with  a  play-minded 
approach  and  through  fun,  etc.,  voluntary  participation  by  the  users  is  encouraged  and 
immersion  is  enabled  [6].  This  increases  problem-solving  skills  through  a  step-by-step 
learning  and,  through  the  functional  characteristics  of  games  that  enable  achievi ng  a 
clear sense of purpose of rules and strategies, induces the subjects to solve problems on 
their own and brings out their participation and positive behavior. The strong  points of 
gamification,  which  clearly  identify  the  purpose,  tasks,  behaviors,  etc.   that  need  to  be 
achieved  and  which  provide  rewards  when  these  are  achieved,  will  facilitate  the 
subjects  to  recognize  and  deal  with  the  situations  that  they  are  facing  in  the  culture 
where  individuals  are  living,  and  the  elements  of  fun,  scores,  level -ups  and  ranking 
competitions are deemed to be able to play the role of sustaining voluntary participation 
by  inducing  the  internal  and  external  motivations  of  the  subjects   [10].  Therefore,  the 
application  of  the  gamification  theory  on  CPR  games  is  expected  to  use  an  important 
factor that sustains the effects of training and participation.

2. Development of Multiplatforms that Use UNITY3D Engine 

In order to produce multiplatform games, for each platform, all the different settings 
of the system must be controllable. In this paper, the use of Unity3D engine is proposed 
based on the reason that codes can be written with C#, JavaScript and Boo, the Unity3D 
engine  was  developed  as  a  C#-  and  Mono-based  code.  The  run-time  part  of  the  engine 
was  developed  with  C++  and  Microsoft  NET  API,  and  the  editor  program  was 
developed with C#. As for the script, it cannot be modified directly in Unity, and it can 
be modified in script editors, such as Mono Develop, etc., that support Unity. Although 
Visual  Studio  also  supports  through  plug-ins,  it  lacks  overall  debugging  functionality 
and, in the Express version, debugging is not supported. In the case of Unity3, not only 
simple  physics  engines  or  shaders,  but  also  realistically,  all  conditions,  including 
network  or  terrain  manipulation,  audio,  video,  animations,  etc.,  are  supported.  By 
converting  web-based  games  and  contents  developed  using  Unity  3D  into  'IOS'  or 
'ANDROID,' they can be serviced as smartphone-use (Figure 1) [10-11]. 
 

Figure 1. Multiplatforms engine; Unity3D 

 

Unity3Dsupports  3  type  of  script  languages:  Java  Script,  C#  and  Boo.  All  three  are 
capable  of  the  same  fast  interaction,  capable  of  utilizing  .NET  libraries,  and  all  three 
support  databases,  standard  expressions,  XML,  networking,  etc.  Even  though  scripting 
is normally considered to  be limited and slow,  Unity3  operates with  very fast iteration 
times and, by pairing up with a compilation of easy native code, becomes almost as fast 
as the C++ level. In addition, the implementation of Java Script for Unity3D operates  at 
the same speed as C# or Boo. Game logic is executed in the .NET platform Mono open 
source;  which  provides  a  best-in-the-world  programming  environment  that  offers  the 
best speed and flexibility [6].  

A  single  line  of  code  is  sufficient  for  moving,  rotating  and  scaling  an  object.  The 
replication, removal and changing of the properties are, of course, the same. Everything can 
be directly referenced via the names, layers, tags, similarity, or touch,  etc. The functionality 
of  Unity3D  is  integrated  with  all  the  MonoDevelop,  in  license.  As  shown  in  Figure  2,  this 
would mean that Unity3D would have IDE of the highest level [6]. 

Unity3D  is  automatically  synchronized  with  MonoDevelop  and  as  well  as  with  Visual 
Studio.  All  internal  references  are  set  so  as  to  attain  a  complete  auto-completion  in  the 
internal API. Unity3D is capable of browser communication with Web Player autonomously. 
The  HTML  page  containing  Unity  Web  Player  contents  are  able  to  communicate  with  the

contents and also the vice versa is possible. Basically there are two communication directions. 
When  importing  the  profile  information  of  individuals  through  the  OpenSocial  API  from  a 
site  that  offers  SNG,  communication  between  the  browser  and  web  player,  and  in  Unity, 
issues  can  easily  be  resolved  by  using  the  GetUnity().  SendMessage  function  and  the 
Application. ExtenalCall function. This can be deemed essential in creating a social network 
game [6].

Scripting in Unity supports all three languages of Java Script, C# and Boo; in addition, all 
3  languages  can  be  used  in  one  project.  As  such,  without  any  restriction  of  one  language, 
script can be written freely. However, within a script, only one script language can be used.  

The first thing one needs to know when writing a script in Unity is a Reference for which 
Overriding  is  possible;  in  which,  the  most  important  are  the  Update,  LateUpdate, 
FixedUpdate, Awakeand Start. The Updatefunction is called for every frame when the script 
is on. As the most frequently-used function in the script, the Time.deltaTime can be used for 
finding out about the pass time. The LateUpdatefunction is also called for every frame,and it 
is  called  after  all  the  Updatefunctions  have  been  called.  The  FixedUpdatefunction,  too,  is 
called  for  every  frame,  and  it  is  used  in  lieu  of  the  Updatefunction  when  treating  the 
Rigibody.  The  Awakefunction  is  called  when  a  script  object  is  being  loaded.  It  is  used  to 
initialize variables or conditions before the game begins, and it is called only once during the 
lifetime of a script object. Because the Awakefunction is called after all the objects have been 
initialized,  it  can  use  safely  all  the  functions  likethe  GameObject.FindWithTag.  When  the 
Updatefunction  is  called  the  first  time,  the  Startfunction  is  called  right  before  the 
Updatefunction.  It  is  called  only  once  during  the  lifetime  of  a  script  object,  and  the 
Awakefunction is always called right before the Startfunction [6]. 

 

4. CPR Game Content Design 

This game was developed for the prevention of deaths of the large number of cardiac arrest 

suffering patients due to not receiving a CPR within the appropriate time [6]. 

The game is a smart SNG based on multiplatforms all applicable in the iPhones, Android 
phones, Windows Mobile and the PC. The game players discover a variety of cardiac arrest 
patients,  such  as  accidental  drowning  patients  vacationing  with  the  family,  fainted  hiker

Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to  spread CPR education to the public and to  promote the 
effects  of  training  using  an  app  design  that  applied  the  gamification  theory  based  on 
UNITY3D engine. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the advancement of 
the online smart SNG market through the promotion of the net functional effects of games by 
applying  the  gamification  theory  on  various  functional  games,  and  by  using  UNITY3D  to 
convert  web-based  games  and  contents  into  ‘IOS’  or  ‘ANDROID’  and  widely  developing 
them  into  smartphone-use  services.  Also  the  clients  in  community  would  likely  be  equipped 
with  an  ability  to  respond  to  emergency  situations,  by  receiving  CPR  training  in  a  fun  and 
easy manner at anytime, anywhere.

1. Introduction 

Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  is  an  emergency  procedure,  performed  in  an 
effort  to  manually  preserve  intact  brain  function  until  further  measures  are  taken  to 
restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in cardiac arrest [1]. 

Cardiac  arrests  occur  suddenly  and  the  patients  are  not  usually  able  to  call  for 
assistance  on  their  own.  4-5  minutes  after  a  cardiac  arrest  brain  damage  starts  to  take 
place;  therefore,  a  quick  first  aid  action  by  a  witness  is  essential   [2-3].  With  each 
minute  of  delay  in  defibrillation  the  survival  rate  can  decrease   by  7%-10%,  however, 
this can be reduced by 2.5%-5% per minute if a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 
performed. In cases where a witness performs a CPR, the survival rate can be 2 -3 times 
higher  [4].  The  rate  of  CPRs  being  performed  by  the  general  public  in  South  Korea  is 
3.1%,  which  is  very  low  when  compared  to  those  of  Sweden  at  77%,  the  United 
States37.4%,  and  Japan  at  12.0%  [5].  The  rate  at  which  a  patient  suffering  from  an 
acute  cardiac  arrest  survives  the  transport  and  is  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  Korea  is 
9.9%  and  the  rate  for  a  live  discharge  from  hospital  is  only  3.0%;  moreover,  in 
particular, the rate for a normal brain function is a mere 0.9%. Whereas, in the case of 
the United States, the rates are 26.4% for a live admission to the hospital, 10.3 % for a 
live  discharge,  and  7.7%  for  a  normal  brain  function.  In  other  words,  whether  or  not  a 
CPR is performed by a witness on a patient suffering a cardiac arrest occurring outside 
the  hospital  becomes  an  important  factor  that  determines  the  patient’s  prognosis   [6]. 
Currently, in the United States and Europe, the encouragement and support for CPR and 
first aid training for the general public are actively being pursued  [6].

patients  on  the  mountain,  unconscious  patients  from  traffic  accidents,  etc.  The  play  that 
discovers  a  patient  calls  911  and  then,  by  performing  a  CPR,  the  player  keeps  the  cardiac 
arrest  patient  alive  until  the  ambulance  arrives.  In  actuality,  the  players  perform  artificial 
respiration and chest compressions by using the touch pad and, by using SNS through SNG 
connections,  they  can  compete  with  many  other  players  (Figure  4).  This  game’s  simple 
interface,  short  game  time  of  about  1-2  minutes,  and  the  introduction  of  a  score  competing 
system maintain the interest level of the game; which, in turn, facilitate the local community 
members  to  learn  how  to  perform  CPR  per  the  correct  method  and  save  lives  and  prevent 
complications when they run into cardiac arrest patients in various settings. Also, this game 
provides an opportunity to check the locations of nearby defibrillators and to learn the proper 
method  of  use,  and  the  game  offers  an  advantage  of  promoting  the  importance  of  CPR  by 
spreading the game via SNS [6].

Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to  spread CPR education to the public and to  promote the 
effects  of  training  using  an  app  design  that  applied  the  gamification  theory  based  on 
UNITY3D engine. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the advancement of 
the online smart SNG market through the promotion of the net functional effects of games by 
applying  the  gamification  theory  on  various  functional  games,  and  by  using  UNITY3D  to 
convert  web-based  games  and  contents  into  ‘IOS’  or  ‘ANDROID’  and  widely  developing 
them  into  smartphone-use  services.  Also  the  clients  in  community  would  likely  be  equipped 
with  an  ability  to  respond  to  emergency  situations,  by  receiving  CPR  training  in  a  fun  and 
easy manner at anytime, anywhere.

1. Introduction 

Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  is  an  emergency  procedure,  performed  in  an 
effort  to  manually  preserve  intact  brain  function  until  further  measures  are  taken  to 
restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in cardiac arrest [1]. 

Cardiac  arrests  occur  suddenly  and  the  patients  are  not  usually  able  to  call  for 
assistance  on  their  own.  4-5  minutes  after  a  cardiac  arrest  brain  damage  starts  to  take 
place;  therefore,  a  quick  first  aid  action  by  a  witness  is  essential   [2-3].  With  each 
minute  of  delay  in  defibrillation  the  survival  rate  can  decrease   by  7%-10%,  however, 
this can be reduced by 2.5%-5% per minute if a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 
performed. In cases where a witness performs a CPR, the survival rate can be 2 -3 times 
higher  [4].  The  rate  of  CPRs  being  performed  by  the  general  public  in  South  Korea  is 
3.1%,  which  is  very  low  when  compared  to  those  of  Sweden  at  77%,  the  United 
States37.4%,  and  Japan  at  12.0%  [5].  The  rate  at  which  a  patient  suffering  from  an 
acute  cardiac  arrest  survives  the  transport  and  is  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  Korea  is 
9.9%  and  the  rate  for  a  live  discharge  from  hospital  is  only  3.0%;  moreover,  in 
particular, the rate for a normal brain function is a mere 0.9%. Whereas, in the case of 
the United States, the rates are 26.4% for a live admission to the hospital, 10.3 % for a 
live  discharge,  and  7.7%  for  a  normal  brain  function.  In  other  words,  whether  or  not  a 
CPR is performed by a witness on a patient suffering a cardiac arrest occurring outside 
the  hospital  becomes  an  important  factor  that  determines  the  patient’s  prognosis   [6]. 
Currently, in the United States and Europe, the encouragement and support for CPR and 
first aid training for the general public are actively being pursued  [6].

In  2008,  in  Korea  as  well,  a  legislation  for  the  installation  and  use  of  automated 
external defibrillators (AED) was put in place, and since 2010, how-to-use training has 
been underway and CPR training is being conducted through the health care training in 
schools  [7].  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  CPR  training  is  optional  and  not  mandatory 
and due to other factors, including the lack of professional teachers, inadequate training 
materials and facilities, the lack of interests, etc., there exists a problem of CPR training 
for  the  general  public  not  being  expanded  sufficiently  [4,  8-9].  In  addition,  since  CPR 
entails  a  layperson  performing  an  unfamiliar  medical  procedure  in  an  emergency 
situation,  what  is  required  in  CPR  training  is  not  just  a  simple  transfer  of  knowledge 
and  skills  but  also  a  repetitive  training  that  instills  self -confidence  and  self-assurance 
about  one’s  own  ability  while  overcoming  the  psychological -social  stress  factors  that 
accompany performing CPRs. Therefore, this study proposes the following: the current 
training infrastructure,  which is insufficient for spreading  CPR training for the  general 
public, needs to be complemented; publicity and interests need to be strengthened; and 
a CPR training method that ensures confidence and assurance needs to be devised.  

SNG  is  a  game  that’s  rapidly  growing  together  with  the  popularization  of 
smartphones on the SNS level, and it is a service that fuses the advantages of SNS such 
as  Twitter,  blogs,  Facebook,  etc.  with  the  enjoyment  of  games  [6].  The  unique  feature 
of  SNG  is  that  it  is  a  new  communication  means  that  utilizes   the  social  relationships 
built in SN where networking can be achieved while enjoying games with a number of 
gamers,  and  it  is  making  advances  while  showing  a  potential  for  the  game  space  to  be 
expanded  into  the  social  space.  It  can  be  said  that  it’s  an  effective  form  of  game,  in 
which,  by  evolving  from  the  existing  games  that  emphasize  personal  accomplishments 
and  rewards,  the  interest  level  is  increased  because  of  the  interaction  among  social 
activity  players  becomes  an  important  element  of  game  playing,  and  participation  by 
the  many  is  induced.  Such  an  SNG  can  be  applied  for  CPR  training  in  that,  by 
combining  a  variety  of  realistic  materials  such  as  texts  usable  in  smartphones,  videos, 
sounds, etc., and it can provide data and assistance in promoting correct understanding 
of  CPR  by  the  general  public  [6].  Furthermore,  it  is  expected  that  the  games  that  are 
associated  with  text  service  and  SNS  service  of  the  smartphones  will  promote 
interaction among the applicable subjects and  provide increased interests  and  publicity 
benefits for CPR training [6]. 

 “Gamification”  is  utilized  as  a  process  that  solves  problems  through  game -like 
thinking  and  game  mechanics  while  facilitating  participation  by  the  users.  In 
gamification,  through  the  problem-solving  activity  of  game  stories  with  a  play-minded 
approach  and  through  fun,  etc.,  voluntary  participation  by  the  users  is  encouraged  and 
immersion  is  enabled  [6].  This  increases  problem-solving  skills  through  a  step-by-step 
learning  and,  through  the  functional  characteristics  of  games  that  enable  achievi ng  a 
clear sense of purpose of rules and strategies, induces the subjects to solve problems on 
their own and brings out their participation and positive behavior. The strong  points of 
gamification,  which  clearly  identify  the  purpose,  tasks,  behaviors,  etc.   that  need  to  be 
achieved  and  which  provide  rewards  when  these  are  achieved,  will  facilitate  the 
subjects  to  recognize  and  deal  with  the  situations  that  they  are  facing  in  the  culture 
where  individuals  are  living,  and  the  elements  of  fun,  scores,  level -ups  and  ranking 
competitions are deemed to be able to play the role of sustaining voluntary participation 
by  inducing  the  internal  and  external  motivations  of  the  subjects   [10].  Therefore,  the 
application  of  the  gamification  theory  on  CPR  games  is  expected  to  use  an  important 
factor that sustains the effects of training and participation.

2. Development of Multiplatforms that Use UNITY3D Engine 

In order to produce multiplatform games, for each platform, all the different settings 
of the system must be controllable. In this paper, the use of Unity3D engine is proposed 
based on the reason that codes can be written with C#, JavaScript and Boo, the Unity3D 
engine  was  developed  as  a  C#-  and  Mono-based  code.  The  run-time  part  of  the  engine 
was  developed  with  C++  and  Microsoft  NET  API,  and  the  editor  program  was 
developed with C#. As for the script, it cannot be modified directly in Unity, and it can 
be modified in script editors, such as Mono Develop, etc., that support Unity. Although 
Visual  Studio  also  supports  through  plug-ins,  it  lacks  overall  debugging  functionality 
and, in the Express version, debugging is not supported. In the case of Unity3, not only 
simple  physics  engines  or  shaders,  but  also  realistically,  all  conditions,  including 
network  or  terrain  manipulation,  audio,  video,  animations,  etc.,  are  supported.  By 
converting  web-based  games  and  contents  developed  using  Unity  3D  into  'IOS'  or 
'ANDROID,' they can be serviced as smartphone-use (Figure 1) [10-11]. 
 

Figure 1. Multiplatforms engine; Unity3D 

 

Unity3Dsupports  3  type  of  script  languages:  Java  Script,  C#  and  Boo.  All  three  are 
capable  of  the  same  fast  interaction,  capable  of  utilizing  .NET  libraries,  and  all  three 
support  databases,  standard  expressions,  XML,  networking,  etc.  Even  though  scripting 
is normally considered to  be limited and slow,  Unity3  operates with  very fast iteration 
times and, by pairing up with a compilation of easy native code, becomes almost as fast 
as the C++ level. In addition, the implementation of Java Script for Unity3D operates  at 
the same speed as C# or Boo. Game logic is executed in the .NET platform Mono open 
source;  which  provides  a  best-in-the-world  programming  environment  that  offers  the 
best speed and flexibility [6].  

A  single  line  of  code  is  sufficient  for  moving,  rotating  and  scaling  an  object.  The 
replication, removal and changing of the properties are, of course, the same. Everything can 
be directly referenced via the names, layers, tags, similarity, or touch,  etc. The functionality 
of  Unity3D  is  integrated  with  all  the  MonoDevelop,  in  license.  As  shown  in  Figure  2,  this 
would mean that Unity3D would have IDE of the highest level [6]. 

Unity3D  is  automatically  synchronized  with  MonoDevelop  and  as  well  as  with  Visual 
Studio.  All  internal  references  are  set  so  as  to  attain  a  complete  auto-completion  in  the 
internal API. Unity3D is capable of browser communication with Web Player autonomously. 
The  HTML  page  containing  Unity  Web  Player  contents  are  able  to  communicate  with  the

contents and also the vice versa is possible. Basically there are two communication directions. 
When  importing  the  profile  information  of  individuals  through  the  OpenSocial  API  from  a 
site  that  offers  SNG,  communication  between  the  browser  and  web  player,  and  in  Unity, 
issues  can  easily  be  resolved  by  using  the  GetUnity().  SendMessage  function  and  the 
Application. ExtenalCall function. This can be deemed essential in creating a social network 
game [6].

Scripting in Unity supports all three languages of Java Script, C# and Boo; in addition, all 
3  languages  can  be  used  in  one  project.  As  such,  without  any  restriction  of  one  language, 
script can be written freely. However, within a script, only one script language can be used.  

The first thing one needs to know when writing a script in Unity is a Reference for which 
Overriding  is  possible;  in  which,  the  most  important  are  the  Update,  LateUpdate, 
FixedUpdate, Awakeand Start. The Updatefunction is called for every frame when the script 
is on. As the most frequently-used function in the script, the Time.deltaTime can be used for 
finding out about the pass time. The LateUpdatefunction is also called for every frame,and it 
is  called  after  all  the  Updatefunctions  have  been  called.  The  FixedUpdatefunction,  too,  is 
called  for  every  frame,  and  it  is  used  in  lieu  of  the  Updatefunction  when  treating  the 
Rigibody.  The  Awakefunction  is  called  when  a  script  object  is  being  loaded.  It  is  used  to 
initialize variables or conditions before the game begins, and it is called only once during the 
lifetime of a script object. Because the Awakefunction is called after all the objects have been 
initialized,  it  can  use  safely  all  the  functions  likethe  GameObject.FindWithTag.  When  the 
Updatefunction  is  called  the  first  time,  the  Startfunction  is  called  right  before  the 
Updatefunction.  It  is  called  only  once  during  the  lifetime  of  a  script  object,  and  the 
Awakefunction is always called right before the Startfunction [6]. 

 

4. CPR Game Content Design 

This game was developed for the prevention of deaths of the large number of cardiac arrest 

suffering patients due to not receiving a CPR within the appropriate time [6]. 

The game is a smart SNG based on multiplatforms all applicable in the iPhones, Android 
phones, Windows Mobile and the PC. The game players discover a variety of cardiac arrest 
patients,  such  as  accidental  drowning  patients  vacationing  with  the  family,  fainted  hiker

patients  on  the  mountain,  unconscious  patients  from  traffic  accidents,  etc.  The  play  that 
discovers  a  patient  calls  911  and  then,  by  performing  a  CPR,  the  player  keeps  the  cardiac 
arrest  patient  alive  until  the  ambulance  arrives.  In  actuality,  the  players  perform  artificial 
respiration and chest compressions by using the touch pad and, by using SNS through SNG 
connections,  they  can  compete  with  many  other  players  (Figure  4).  This  game’s  simple 
interface,  short  game  time  of  about  1-2  minutes,  and  the  introduction  of  a  score  competing 
system maintain the interest level of the game; which, in turn, facilitate the local community 
members  to  learn  how  to  perform  CPR  per  the  correct  method  and  save  lives  and  prevent 
complications when they run into cardiac arrest patients in various settings. Also, this game 
provides an opportunity to check the locations of nearby defibrillators and to learn the proper 
method  of  use,  and  the  game  offers  an  advantage  of  promoting  the  importance  of  CPR  by 
spreading the game via SNS [6].

5. Conclusion 

This study proposed to provide CPR training to the general public and to promote the 
effects  of  training.  An  app  design  was  proposed  that  applied  the  gamification  theory 
based  on  smart  multiplatforms  using  UNITY3D  engine.  The  results  of  this  study  are 
expected to contribute to the advancement of the online smart SNG market through the 
promotion  of  the  net  functional  effects  of  games  by  applying    the  gamification  theory 
on  various functional  games, and by  using UNITY3D to convert web-based  games and 
contents  into  ‘IOS’  or  ‘ANDROID’  and  widely  developing  them  into  smartphone-use 
services [6]. Also, the clients in community would likely be equipped with an ability to 
respond to emergency situations, by receiving CPR training in a  fun and easy manner at 
anytime, anywhere.
