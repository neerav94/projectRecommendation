I.        Introduction 

        Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is currently one of the most used notions in articles and studies dealing 
with computer applications. Nowadays it is very difficult for a company to convince a customer (a potential client) with 
only  product  or  price  arguments  because  of  the  strong  competition  in  almost  all  market  areas.  Companies  therefore 
reflected how to win the competition. One of the possibilities is to have the better client support  – not only in the after 
sales phase, but also in all other phases of the client communication process, i.e. in the acquisition phase or in the loyalty 
phase.  To  develop  solutions  which  integrate  the  high  potentials  of  multimedia,  internet  and  mobile  communication  as 
well as the potentials of Collaborative Systems (CS). In a  certain  manner, clients of a company or organisation can be 
part of a collaborative solution. 
 
A.  Existing System : 

In  the  early  20th  century  in  the  United  States,  demand  outpaced  supply  to  the  extent  that  companies,  
concentrated  on  selling  as  many  products  as  possible.  Suppliers  focused  on  product  development,  manufacturing  
capacity, and  securing distribution outlets,  without regard to their consumers. They did  not pay  much attention to  who 
bought  their  products  or  what  their  customers  needed.  They  used  classic  marketing  tactics,  i.e.,  mass  marketing  – 
primarily print and broadcast advertising, mass mailings, and billboards.      

By  the  middle  of  the  20th  century,  however,  the  economy  had  matured  to  a  point  where  consumers  had  the 
power  of  choice  because  supply  had  outstripped  demand.  The  era  of  the  passive  consumer  was  coming  to  an  end. 
Companies  began  to  find  out  who  their  customers  were,  what  they  wanted,  and  how  they  could  be  satisfied.  They 
analyzed  data  about  their  customers  and  segmented  them  based  on  their  demographics,  such  as  age,  gender,  and  other 
personal information. Then they promoted their product or service to a specific subset of customers and prospects. This 
was  called  ―target  marketing.‖  Each  company  thought  seriously  about  the  ―four  P’s‖  (price,  promotion,  product,  and

    GPS tool can be tools for determining the distance between two points or to accurately determine the acres in 
a  field  that  is  to  be  rented. The  distance  between  two  sampling  points  and  the  area  of  a  field  can  be  found  using  GPS 
coordinates  and  knowledge  of  the  Earth  Terrestrial  Coordinate  System.  Because  GPS  latitude  and  longitude  are  in 
terrestrial coordinates, determining the distance in length measurements (feet, meters, yards, kilometers, and miles) rather 
than  degrees,  between  two  points  is  not  trivial.  The  objective  of  this  guideline  is  to  provide  a  method  that  farmers, 
ranchers,  or  agricultural  practitioners  can  use  to  calculate  distances  between  points  and  to  calculate  the  size  of  a  field 
using Excel, a commonly available spreadsheet. A more detailed description for calculating distance and area is found in 
Carlson (1999), in which the mathematics and assumptions used to create the model used in this guideline are described.

III.            Proposed System 

CRM  is  about  understanding  the  nature  of  the  exchange  between  customer  and  supplier  and  managing  it 
appropriately. The exchange contains monetary considerations between supplier and customer – but also communication. 
The challenge to all supplier organizations is to optimize communications between parties to ensure profitable long-term 
relationships.  CRM  is  a  key  focus  for  many  organizations  now  as  a  shift  away  from  customer  acquisition  toward 
customer-retention  and  churn  reduction  strategies  dictates  a  need  for  best  practice  CRM  processes.  CRM  is  an 
application  that  enables  companies  to  make  the  move  towards  being  a  customer  centered  organization  by  putting  the 
customer at the centre of all the information that relates to them and allowing authorized people within the organization 
to access the information. In a customer centered organization, salespeople would have access to all the information that 
affects their relationship with their customer. The conversations, the emails, the complaints, the complaint resolutions, all 
the information that had been sent to the customer, who else in the company the customer had spoken to …… everything 
that  affects  their  ability  to  service  the  customer  and  sell  more  product  or  services  to  them.  Customers  of  a  customer 
centered  organization  feel  more  valued.  Their  requests  are  dealt  with  more  rapidly  and  accurately  because  all  the 
information required to service the request is in one place. Customer centered organizations may have a higher customer 
retention rates than competitors organized along traditional lines because of this.

I.        Introduction 

        Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is currently one of the most used notions in articles and studies dealing 
with computer applications. Nowadays it is very difficult for a company to convince a customer (a potential client) with 
only  product  or  price  arguments  because  of  the  strong  competition  in  almost  all  market  areas.  Companies  therefore 
reflected how to win the competition. One of the possibilities is to have the better client support  – not only in the after 
sales phase, but also in all other phases of the client communication process, i.e. in the acquisition phase or in the loyalty 
phase.  To  develop  solutions  which  integrate  the  high  potentials  of  multimedia,  internet  and  mobile  communication  as 
well as the potentials of Collaborative Systems (CS). In a  certain  manner, clients of a company or organisation can be 
part of a collaborative solution. 
 
A.  Existing System : 

In  the  early  20th  century  in  the  United  States,  demand  outpaced  supply  to  the  extent  that  companies,  
concentrated  on  selling  as  many  products  as  possible.  Suppliers  focused  on  product  development,  manufacturing  
capacity, and  securing distribution outlets,  without regard to their consumers. They did  not pay  much attention to  who 
bought  their  products  or  what  their  customers  needed.  They  used  classic  marketing  tactics,  i.e.,  mass  marketing  – 
primarily print and broadcast advertising, mass mailings, and billboards.      

By  the  middle  of  the  20th  century,  however,  the  economy  had  matured  to  a  point  where  consumers  had  the 
power  of  choice  because  supply  had  outstripped  demand.  The  era  of  the  passive  consumer  was  coming  to  an  end. 
Companies  began  to  find  out  who  their  customers  were,  what  they  wanted,  and  how  they  could  be  satisfied.  They 
analyzed  data  about  their  customers  and  segmented  them  based  on  their  demographics,  such  as  age,  gender,  and  other 
personal information. Then they promoted their product or service to a specific subset of customers and prospects. This 
was  called  ―target  marketing.‖  Each  company  thought  seriously  about  the  ―four  P’s‖  (price,  promotion,  product,  and 
placement),  the  basic  concept  of  modern  marketing,  which  was  first  suggested  by  the  expert  in  the  field,  Jerome 
McCarthy, in 1960.

A.  Global Positioning System : 

II.          Related Work 

    GPS tool can be tools for determining the distance between two points or to accurately determine the acres in 
a  field  that  is  to  be  rented. The  distance  between  two  sampling  points  and  the  area  of  a  field  can  be  found  using  GPS 
coordinates  and  knowledge  of  the  Earth  Terrestrial  Coordinate  System.  Because  GPS  latitude  and  longitude  are  in 
terrestrial coordinates, determining the distance in length measurements (feet, meters, yards, kilometers, and miles) rather 
than  degrees,  between  two  points  is  not  trivial.  The  objective  of  this  guideline  is  to  provide  a  method  that  farmers, 
ranchers,  or  agricultural  practitioners  can  use  to  calculate  distances  between  points  and  to  calculate  the  size  of  a  field 
using Excel, a commonly available spreadsheet. A more detailed description for calculating distance and area is found in 
Carlson (1999), in which the mathematics and assumptions used to create the model used in this guideline are described. 
A Basic programming language computer program is also available in that paper. 
 
B.   Calculating Distance Between two Points:  

     Use a DGPS (differential corrected GPS) to determine the latitude and longitudes of two points on the earth 
surface  and  determine  an  approximate  elevation.  In  the  example,  we  have  used  a  Trimble  132  DGPS  receiver  to 
determine the latitude and longitude of the ends of a 300 ft. 
 GPS report locations. 
 

III.            Proposed System 

CRM  is  about  understanding  the  nature  of  the  exchange  between  customer  and  supplier  and  managing  it 
appropriately. The exchange contains monetary considerations between supplier and customer – but also communication. 
The challenge to all supplier organizations is to optimize communications between parties to ensure profitable long-term 
relationships.  CRM  is  a  key  focus  for  many  organizations  now  as  a  shift  away  from  customer  acquisition  toward 
customer-retention  and  churn  reduction  strategies  dictates  a  need  for  best  practice  CRM  processes.  CRM  is  an 
application  that  enables  companies  to  make  the  move  towards  being  a  customer  centered  organization  by  putting  the 
customer at the centre of all the information that relates to them and allowing authorized people within the organization 
to access the information. In a customer centered organization, salespeople would have access to all the information that 
affects their relationship with their customer. The conversations, the emails, the complaints, the complaint resolutions, all 
the information that had been sent to the customer, who else in the company the customer had spoken to …… everything 
that  affects  their  ability  to  service  the  customer  and  sell  more  product  or  services  to  them.  Customers  of  a  customer 
centered  organization  feel  more  valued.  Their  requests  are  dealt  with  more  rapidly  and  accurately  because  all  the 
information required to service the request is in one place. Customer centered organizations may have a higher customer 
retention rates than competitors organized along traditional lines because of this.

CRM is an application that enables companies to make the move towards being a customer centered organization by

B.   Server Moduls:  

1.  View Sales Entities : . It features to display all the sales related entities — Order processing, Sales person track 
Report & visits, Contacts, Products where the sales personnel can navigate to the respective entity and get the 
required information.                  

2.  Customer,  Product,  Sales  Person  Master  Screens:  This  module  will  help  distributors    to  add/edit/delete 

product, sales person or product  

3.  Customer  allocation  to  sales  person:  Distributor  should  be  able  to  allocate  customers  to  sales  person,  Sales 

person is expected to visit this customer site and introduce them about the new products. 
 

C.  Android Application Modul :  

1.  Authentication for Different Roles: Different logins are given with different access. 
2.  Sales  Person  Geo  Tracking:  Tracking  is  performed  on  Android  phone  from  Distributor  to  Customer.  It  will 

give the entire data about the location of sales person. 

3.  Customer Order Processing: Sales person will take the customer order and save it in database. 
4.  Product View : Sales person will be able to view the product and even customer can select product  

from the list. 
 

D.   Google Map :  

It is conceivable to offer the salesman the opportunity to write down location oriented impressions he had during 
his trip using his mobile diary. This location-based information can be centralized in a mashup using Google maps. Now 
other  Distributer  can  track  the  way  path  of  the  salesman    wheather  he  is  going  to  related  customer  or  not. 
If  the  salesman  not  visiting  the  customer  or  make  fraud  with  distributer  ,  this  application  will  track  the  position  of 
saleman.

people  within  the  organization  to  access  the  information.  In  a  customer  centered  organization,  salespeople  would  have 
access to all the information that affects their relationship with their customer.  If the customer is satisfied in all phases of 
a  CRM-Value  Chain,  he  will,  due  to  our  Mobile  CRM-Services,  move  step  by  step  from  the  status  of  a  one-time 
customer to the status of a patron – which is the main goal of modern CRM. In this manner, CRM mobile services also 
represent a specific kind of collaboration between companies on one hand and the clients on the other hand.
