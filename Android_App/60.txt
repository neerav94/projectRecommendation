INTRODUCTION

In  modern  days,  we  must  make  use  of  various  high-tech
tools  and  equipments  to  get  our  jobs  done  and  make  our  life
much  easier.  The  homeowner  must  be  able  to  control  these
machineries.  Thus  a  system  of  remote  monitoring  and
controlling  is  very  much  necessary.  Smart  home  is  one  of
these  types  of  system  equipped  with  home  appliances  which
we wish to control smartly from anywhere. Some products are
commercially  available  which  allow  remote  home  appliance
controlling  through  internet  which  is  undoubtedly  emerging.
But  it  lacks  the  true  sense  of  real  mobility  and  security,

So, following are the hardware requirement for the system to

be developed.

A. Microcontroller (8051)

Microcontroller used is 8051.It is one of  the  most popular  8
bit  microcontrollers.  It  can  address  128  Kbytes  of  external
memory  and  has  a basic  instruction  time  of  1microseconds. It
has  128  byte  internal  RAM  and  4  KB  internal  ROM. It  is
available in 40 pin dual in line package.

C. Analog-to-Digital-Converter (ADC)

To  convert  the  analog  signals  received  from  the  sensors  to
digital form so that the microcontroller can process them we are
using ADC 0808. The ADC0808 is a monolithic CMOS device
with  an  8-bitanalog-to-digitalconverter,  8-channel  multiplexer
and  microprocessor  compatible  control  logic.  The8-channel
multiplexer  can  directly  access  any  of  8-single-ended  analog
signals.

D. MAX 232

Fig. 2 Microcontroller 8051

B. ULN Darlington Driver

The ULN Darlington array is used as it a high voltage, high-
current  array  which  is  ideally  suited  for  interfacing between
low-level  logic  microcontroller  and  multiple  peripheral power
loads of relay boards. Typical power loads totaling over 260 W
(350  mA  x  8,  95  V) can  be  controlled  at  an  appropriate  duty
cycle depending on ambient temperature and number of drivers
turned ON simultaneously.

Fig. 5 MAX 232

The  MAX232  IC  is  used  to  convert  the  TTL/CMOS  logic
levels  to  RS232  logic  levels  during  serial  communication  of
microcontrollers with PC. The controller operates at TTL logic
level (0-5V) whereas the serial communication in PC works on
RS232  standards  (-25  V  to  +  25V).  This  makes  it  difficult  to
establish a direct link between them to communicate with each
other,  so  we  are  using  MAX232  to  provide  this  intermediate
link.

E. Sensors

Various  different

types  of  sensors  are  connected  to  the
microcontroller through ADC0808. These sensors can be smoke

sensors to detect fire, temperature sensors, proximity, presence
sensors, etc. Theses sensors add more functionality and security
to the system.

III. CONCEPT OF HOME AUTOMATION

We have proposed a mobile-based home automation system
which  consists  of  a  Smartphone  (Android)  with  basic
advanced  facilities  (Wi-Fi)  and  a  home  server.  The  home
appliances  are  controlled  by  the  home  server,  which  operates
according  to  the user  command  received  from  the  android
application  on  mobile  phone.  The  mobile  phone  serves  as  a
remote  control  through  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the
home automation system. The server is basically a laptop or a
PC  with  Wi-Fi  facility.  As  shown  in  system  architecture
diagram,  to  this  server  a  microcontroller  (µC)  is  interfaced
through  MAX232.  The  devices  like  fans,  lightning  in  room,
TV,  security  cameras,  etc  are  monitored  &  controlled  by
connecting  them  to  the  µC  through  ULN  and  relays,  also  the
sensors  are  monitored  by  interfacing  them  to  µC  through
ADC.

On  the  server  side,  Apache  Tomcat  will  listen  to  these
objects. This server application is developed on J2EE platform,
since  the  communication  will  take  place  using  serialized
objects,  so  this  application  is  developed  using  servlets  which
uses  HTTP  protocol.  The  main  business  logic  resides  in  the
servlets.  Java  servlets are  server-side  programs  that  handle
clients’  requests  and  return  a  customized  or  dynamic  response
for each request. Java servlets are more efficient, easier to use,
more powerful, more portable, and cheaper than traditional CGI
technologies. Server will send the signals to hardware module.

Now  on  the  hardware  side,  the  circuit  diagram  is shown
above.  Here  you  can  see  that Port  0  and  Port  2  of  89C51
microcontroller is connected to ADC 0808. Port 0 will receive
data from ADC while Port 2 of  µC will send control for ADC.
Port 3 is connected to MAX232 to interface it with server. Port
1 is connected to ULN to adjust the voltage level between relay
and  µC.  This  hardware  is  interfaced  to  server  using  JNI(Java
Native  Interface).  This  technology  uses  DLL  files  created  in
VC++ to actually interface the hardware add the function  calls
are implemented in Java. This is how we can manage hardware
interfacing in Java.

Home  automation 

the  controlling  and
monitoring of various home appliances by a single system and
brings greater convenience and better security.

thus  allows 

IV. ACTIVITY DIAGRAM

The Fig. 7 below represents the activity diagram of system. It
shows  the  process  of  flow  of  activities.  Initially,  user  has  to
open  the  application  from  mobile  and  login.  If  user  is  a  new
then  he  must  sign  up  for  username  and  password  else  he  may
sign in quickly. Now the user is authenticated and on successful
authentication  user  can  access  the  android  application.  Now
from  the  GUI  of  the  application  the  user  can  send  request  for
various  kinds  of  operations  as  shown  in  the  diagram.  Now  the
server  receives  this  request  and  responds  by  performing
appropriate operations and then the user can view the status of
the devices and other parameters.

Fig. 6 Circuit Diagram

Android application  is developed  in  JAVA  (SDK)  using
XML layout, for this we require Android Plug-In. Then this app
needs to be installed on mobile device. Now, user will be acting
as  a  Client  and  send requests  to  the  server.  The  client-server
communication  will  take  place  through  Android  Networking
which will convert them into serialized objects.

V. CONCLUSION

In  this  paper  we  present  a  new  design  to  control  the
appliances  at  home.  A  real  time  system  is  built  using
microcontroller  8051.  The  microcontroller  is  interfaced  with
sensor  and  appliances  to  control  and  monitor  them.  By
implementing  alarm  system  a  good  safety  measurement  has
been  taken  to  notify  the  user  when  the  threshold  value  is
exceeded.  The  incorporation  of  Wi-Fi  helps  to  lower  the
expense of such systems and the intrusiveness of the respective
system installation. The system provides a separate key to each
device,  and  all  users  have  their  own  log-in.  Thus  system
coordinates  safety  and  security  issues  in  a  clear  and  consistent
manner.  The  system  also  provides  for  scalability  by  allowing
addition  of  new  devices  within  the  network.  Thus  the  paper
provides  a  low-cost,  flexible,  user-friendly,  and  very  secure
architecture for implementing a Home Automation System.
