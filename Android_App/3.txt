Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

Pre-Launch (Fall 2008 - Summer 2009): We leveraged productivity lessons from a 6

First Year of Offering (Fall 2009-Summer 2010): The Apps from the engineering


year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts

engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

V. Challenges in Replicating Our Work:
We list here the problems we faced and our solutions that are working.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Third Year of Offering (Fall 2011 - Summer 2012): During Fall 2011, undergraduate

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

V. Challenges in Replicating Our Work:
We list here the problems we faced and our solutions that are working.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Our work suggests that the creation of undergraduate interdisciplinary teams for the development
of Android Apps is extraordinarily fruitful, not just for the sake of said Apps, but perhaps more
so as an introduction to team work environments that programmers, animators, and marketers
might find themselves in the future. Especially problematic, though, were the types of activities
that students themselves developed for working through application, process, and design issues.
Each small group appeared to understand the end product and their role (as programmer, graphic
designer, or marketer), but each was uniformly bereft of knowledge or skills for working
together in a coordinated, team-centered manner.

Their insight led to the following improvements in our Summer 2012 course: (1) Students did
not want to form teams by the second week of the course - they wanted some time to ‘settle
down’ and build connections. So, we now give them about five weeks before the above cited
team assignments start. (2) Non-engineering students had to wait for the engineering students to
complete a reasonably good prototype before they could proceed. Discussions (on promotional
video, market niche, etc) of business majors and asset (graphics, animation, etc.) creation of
artists were delayed as a consequence. So, we now have a quick prototype created with the App
Inventor17 that can then be used by business and arts majors to proceed on their own. This helps
provide for early synchronization and goal clarification for the whole team. (3) Students could
not meet their paired team mates from other disciplines. We now have scheduled ‘lab hours’ that
they sign up for. These are two hours during the week when they are available online to talk to
each other. The faculty members can schedule makeup or discussion sessions specific to
teams/sub-teams during these lab hours. (4) Students were overwhelmed with both discipline
specific assignments and team-wide project assignments. We now limit to five discipline specific
assignments, with several others provided as self-assignments. (5) Some of the engineering
students questioned the need for a team oriented project - they felt confident that they could
develop all of it on their own. We invited industry professionals to give guest lectures and also to
participate in team project evaluations. The teams hopefully now see that we are attempting to
create a microcosm of the real world in these courses. The business students usually grasp the
significance of this networking opportunity; but others have also benefitted). (6) The business
majors also misunderstood university IP (intellectual property) policies, which caused much
friction. Our Director for Technology Transfer has agreed to meet with the teams if they wish to
get clarification. Further, the Director can also help them start their business at our university’s
incubation center.

V. C Scalability and Transferability: We want to facilitate other faculty teams interested in
setting up similar courses. We will describe the stumble we had and how we are recovering from
it. During Spring 2012 we extended our collaboration to include the college of business, without
our staged process of due diligence. Apps developed clearly reached a higher plateau of real
world metrics9; but personality conflicts were more prevalent at both the faculty and student
levels alike. Fortunately, the three teaching professors on this paper were all enrolled during
Spring 2012 in the same team eLearning designer/ facilitator certification course at our
eLearning center. This was an intensive semester long course. This qualified us to teach the
eLearning course last summer. Our eLearning center23 fosters the “pedagogic integration of
technology into the design of teaching and learning processes through collaborative efforts with
faculty and other instructional technology personnel. It is where teaching, learning and

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

Pre-Launch (Fall 2008 - Summer 2009): We leveraged productivity lessons from a 6

First Year of Offering (Fall 2009-Summer 2010): The Apps from the engineering


year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see

others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Our work suggests that the creation of undergraduate interdisciplinary teams for the development
of Android Apps is extraordinarily fruitful, not just for the sake of said Apps, but perhaps more
so as an introduction to team work environments that programmers, animators, and marketers
might find themselves in the future. Especially problematic, though, were the types of activities
that students themselves developed for working through application, process, and design issues.
Each small group appeared to understand the end product and their role (as programmer, graphic
designer, or marketer), but each was uniformly bereft of knowledge or skills for working
together in a coordinated, team-centered manner.

Their insight led to the following improvements in our Summer 2012 course: (1) Students did
not want to form teams by the second week of the course - they wanted some time to ‘settle
down’ and build connections. So, we now give them about five weeks before the above cited
team assignments start. (2) Non-engineering students had to wait for the engineering students to
complete a reasonably good prototype before they could proceed. Discussions (on promotional
video, market niche, etc) of business majors and asset (graphics, animation, etc.) creation of
artists were delayed as a consequence. So, we now have a quick prototype created with the App
Inventor17 that can then be used by business and arts majors to proceed on their own. This helps
provide for early synchronization and goal clarification for the whole team. (3) Students could
not meet their paired team mates from other disciplines. We now have scheduled ‘lab hours’ that
they sign up for. These are two hours during the week when they are available online to talk to
each other. The faculty members can schedule makeup or discussion sessions specific to
teams/sub-teams during these lab hours. (4) Students were overwhelmed with both discipline
specific assignments and team-wide project assignments. We now limit to five discipline specific
assignments, with several others provided as self-assignments. (5) Some of the engineering
students questioned the need for a team oriented project - they felt confident that they could
develop all of it on their own. We invited industry professionals to give guest lectures and also to
participate in team project evaluations. The teams hopefully now see that we are attempting to
create a microcosm of the real world in these courses. The business students usually grasp the
significance of this networking opportunity; but others have also benefitted). (6) The business
majors also misunderstood university IP (intellectual property) policies, which caused much
friction. Our Director for Technology Transfer has agreed to meet with the teams if they wish to
get clarification. Further, the Director can also help them start their business at our university’s
incubation center.

V. C Scalability and Transferability: We want to facilitate other faculty teams interested in
setting up similar courses. We will describe the stumble we had and how we are recovering from
it. During Spring 2012 we extended our collaboration to include the college of business, without
our staged process of due diligence. Apps developed clearly reached a higher plateau of real
world metrics9; but personality conflicts were more prevalent at both the faculty and student
levels alike. Fortunately, the three teaching professors on this paper were all enrolled during
Spring 2012 in the same team eLearning designer/ facilitator certification course at our
eLearning center. This was an intensive semester long course. This qualified us to teach the
eLearning course last summer. Our eLearning center23 fosters the “pedagogic integration of
technology into the design of teaching and learning processes through collaborative efforts with
faculty and other instructional technology personnel. It is where teaching, learning and

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

technology intersect to meet the rapidly changing educational, social and economic environments
in today's global society.” The eLearning course24 that we took used backward design of Wiggin
and McTighe 25 and assessment techniques based on Angelo26, Dunn27 and Mueller28. We
designed our joint summer course as a class requirement14. It allowed us all to appreciate the
teaching and learning pedagogy. This also helped us with regard to faculty team dynamics, since
we had the same vocabulary of teaching and learning outcomes, metrics, etc. Even then, we took
a step back during summer 2012 to a two-way joint eLearning course, between engineering and
arts students; we, however, did extend it to online teams. With the help of the instruction
designers and our own anthropology research, we now have a clearer roadmap on how to
develop a multiple-college course with BASE faculty and students15.

VI. Discussion:
We discuss here issues beyond the course boundaries.

VI.A Accreditation: Our various BASE disciplines are accredited under AACSB29, ABET3 and
SACS30. Though the individual keywords used vary, general themes in all these accreditations
include group-based activities, authentic learning, problem solving, critical thinking, and
systems-thinking. Starting from ABET’s criteria 3 (a- k) on student outcomes, we have
developed a framework of generalized learning outcomes to meet; apply STEM knowledge,
research and analyze, design and optimize, work on team projects, solve problems, become
ethical and responsible, communicate well, impact the community, learn life-long, achieve
excellence, and gain professionally. These metrics will be tracked through post-surveys of the
students, evaluation by the judging professionals, and long-term follow-up. They will not be used
to grade the students, but to appreciate better the steps to be undertaken (such as new software
tools for online learning and access to content, improved pedagogy, better assessment
techniques, etc.) to achieve those outcomes.

VI.B The Engineering Student: We believe that any engineering student can participate in this
course. The current course is listed as a semi-core course in the computer engineering curriculum
and thus attracts only computer engineering majors. We, however, find that current engineering
and computer science students have strong enough Java or programming background that we can
help them complete the Apps. Consider that we have taught this to high school students and that
a few arts students have taken our graduate course. There is a good reason for that: Android is
rich in its library support; one can build great Apps fairly easily. Since the Apps are different,
most students are willing to help each other. We also grade their work on an absolute basis which
reduces anxiety in out-competing others.

VI.C Tools Used: For the engineering aspect, we used open source tools (Eclipse, Java and
Android SDK) 4.10, 19. Open source tools in engineering are free and are supported by a strong
community spirit, which makes tutorials, code, Apps, quick help, etc., much easier to seek. Also,
more complex Apps can be built on pre-designed building blocks ( application programming
interfaces or APIs, libraries and components), thus facilitating easy learning and rapid
prototyping. We also chose the Android platform rather than the iPhone platform because of the
market trend of steadily increasing market share (currently at 60% Vs. 25% for iPhone). This
also implies that chances are that each team will have at least one or two students with the
Android smart phones with the latest operating system. Our course flow got better as the Android

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

Pre-Launch (Fall 2008 - Summer 2009): We leveraged productivity lessons from a 6


year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Third Year of Offering (Fall 2011 - Summer 2012): During Fall 2011, undergraduate

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Our work suggests that the creation of undergraduate interdisciplinary teams for the development
of Android Apps is extraordinarily fruitful, not just for the sake of said Apps, but perhaps more
so as an introduction to team work environments that programmers, animators, and marketers
might find themselves in the future. Especially problematic, though, were the types of activities
that students themselves developed for working through application, process, and design issues.
Each small group appeared to understand the end product and their role (as programmer, graphic
designer, or marketer), but each was uniformly bereft of knowledge or skills for working
together in a coordinated, team-centered manner.

Their insight led to the following improvements in our Summer 2012 course: (1) Students did
not want to form teams by the second week of the course - they wanted some time to ‘settle
down’ and build connections. So, we now give them about five weeks before the above cited
team assignments start. (2) Non-engineering students had to wait for the engineering students to
complete a reasonably good prototype before they could proceed. Discussions (on promotional
video, market niche, etc) of business majors and asset (graphics, animation, etc.) creation of
artists were delayed as a consequence. So, we now have a quick prototype created with the App
Inventor17 that can then be used by business and arts majors to proceed on their own. This helps
provide for early synchronization and goal clarification for the whole team. (3) Students could
not meet their paired team mates from other disciplines. We now have scheduled ‘lab hours’ that
they sign up for. These are two hours during the week when they are available online to talk to
each other. The faculty members can schedule makeup or discussion sessions specific to
teams/sub-teams during these lab hours. (4) Students were overwhelmed with both discipline
specific assignments and team-wide project assignments. We now limit to five discipline specific
assignments, with several others provided as self-assignments. (5) Some of the engineering
students questioned the need for a team oriented project - they felt confident that they could
develop all of it on their own. We invited industry professionals to give guest lectures and also to
participate in team project evaluations. The teams hopefully now see that we are attempting to
create a microcosm of the real world in these courses. The business students usually grasp the
significance of this networking opportunity; but others have also benefitted). (6) The business
majors also misunderstood university IP (intellectual property) policies, which caused much
friction. Our Director for Technology Transfer has agreed to meet with the teams if they wish to
get clarification. Further, the Director can also help them start their business at our university’s
incubation center.

V. C Scalability and Transferability: We want to facilitate other faculty teams interested in
setting up similar courses. We will describe the stumble we had and how we are recovering from
it. During Spring 2012 we extended our collaboration to include the college of business, without
our staged process of due diligence. Apps developed clearly reached a higher plateau of real
world metrics9; but personality conflicts were more prevalent at both the faculty and student
levels alike. Fortunately, the three teaching professors on this paper were all enrolled during
Spring 2012 in the same team eLearning designer/ facilitator certification course at our
eLearning center. This was an intensive semester long course. This qualified us to teach the
eLearning course last summer. Our eLearning center23 fosters the “pedagogic integration of
technology into the design of teaching and learning processes through collaborative efforts with
faculty and other instructional technology personnel. It is where teaching, learning and

technology intersect to meet the rapidly changing educational, social and economic environments
in today's global society.” The eLearning course24 that we took used backward design of Wiggin
and McTighe 25 and assessment techniques based on Angelo26, Dunn27 and Mueller28. We
designed our joint summer course as a class requirement14. It allowed us all to appreciate the
teaching and learning pedagogy. This also helped us with regard to faculty team dynamics, since
we had the same vocabulary of teaching and learning outcomes, metrics, etc. Even then, we took
a step back during summer 2012 to a two-way joint eLearning course, between engineering and
arts students; we, however, did extend it to online teams. With the help of the instruction
designers and our own anthropology research, we now have a clearer roadmap on how to
develop a multiple-college course with BASE faculty and students15.

VI. Discussion:
We discuss here issues beyond the course boundaries.

VI.A Accreditation: Our various BASE disciplines are accredited under AACSB29, ABET3 and
SACS30. Though the individual keywords used vary, general themes in all these accreditations
include group-based activities, authentic learning, problem solving, critical thinking, and
systems-thinking. Starting from ABET’s criteria 3 (a- k) on student outcomes, we have
developed a framework of generalized learning outcomes to meet; apply STEM knowledge,
research and analyze, design and optimize, work on team projects, solve problems, become
ethical and responsible, communicate well, impact the community, learn life-long, achieve
excellence, and gain professionally. These metrics will be tracked through post-surveys of the
students, evaluation by the judging professionals, and long-term follow-up. They will not be used
to grade the students, but to appreciate better the steps to be undertaken (such as new software
tools for online learning and access to content, improved pedagogy, better assessment
techniques, etc.) to achieve those outcomes.

VI.B The Engineering Student: We believe that any engineering student can participate in this
course. The current course is listed as a semi-core course in the computer engineering curriculum
and thus attracts only computer engineering majors. We, however, find that current engineering
and computer science students have strong enough Java or programming background that we can
help them complete the Apps. Consider that we have taught this to high school students and that
a few arts students have taken our graduate course. There is a good reason for that: Android is
rich in its library support; one can build great Apps fairly easily. Since the Apps are different,
most students are willing to help each other. We also grade their work on an absolute basis which
reduces anxiety in out-competing others.

VI.C Tools Used: For the engineering aspect, we used open source tools (Eclipse, Java and
Android SDK) 4.10, 19. Open source tools in engineering are free and are supported by a strong
community spirit, which makes tutorials, code, Apps, quick help, etc., much easier to seek. Also,
more complex Apps can be built on pre-designed building blocks ( application programming
interfaces or APIs, libraries and components), thus facilitating easy learning and rapid
prototyping. We also chose the Android platform rather than the iPhone platform because of the
market trend of steadily increasing market share (currently at 60% Vs. 25% for iPhone). This
also implies that chances are that each team will have at least one or two students with the
Android smart phones with the latest operating system. Our course flow got better as the Android

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

infrastructure got more sophisticated. So, we are now well set to take advantage of a
sophisticated platform. The arts professor has struggled with accepting open source tools and the
componentization concept. Unlike the functionality goal of engineers, the artists take pride on
aesthetic beauty and uniqueness of their creation. The open source tools in art are not as well
accepted as are some of the commercial products (such as Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and
Camtasia), which incidentally are available at low cost to educational entities. We are, however,
slowly, making progress in incorporating open tools (such as Blender). The business tools used
are easy to obtain and use.

VI.D Marketing of Apps: We wish to market Apps through our university to secure some
funding to sustain the program. We wish to support two undergraduate students to help place a
select few Apps on the App market, maintain our website, tag the App assets, fine tune the tools
(yet to be developed), and generally improve the experience of students taking the course online
and F2F. Further, generating some revenue will motivate student groups to work together and
see collaborative opportunities beyond the university environment. This is not a problem for our
business students, but is for engineering and arts students. FAU has set up an account to receive
revenues from marketing the 25+ Apps in our portfolio. Some Apps will be marketed soon. We
could not market the Apps so far for three main reasons: (1) Our university has had its share of
turnovers. Decisions made by earlier administrators were reviewed by newer ones and the
characteristics of the account changed. However, the good thing is that currently it is a robust
structure that other universities can emulate. (2) Both software and hardware of Android smart
phones underwent rapid evolution. As an example, we used Nexus 1 and Android 2.2 version in
the first year; today, the versions to use are Nexus 4 and 7, and Android 3.1 and above. So, all
the Apps developed earlier have to be mapped to newer hardware platforms with different screen
sizes and resolutions. Of course, newer versions of the operating system do support all the earlier
software; so, that was not a problem. (3) All the colleges involved noted a popularity trend and
encouraged us to teach these joint courses more often. So, there were more coordination
challenges to face and less time to market the existing Apps.

VI.E Marketability of Apps: The marketability was decided by the industry professionals who
evaluated the projects as per a rubric9. The rubric may need some tweaking. A case in point:
We surveyed high school students on the marketability of our summer 2010 Apps. It was
interesting that some of the Apps that the adult judges considered not marketable were the ones
that appealed to them the most. So, the ‘marketability’ as defined here is limited to the opinion of
judging professionals. Putting all Apps on the market is not an option since much ‘production’
work will have to be completed to do so, as explained above. Also, some of these may have
missing some of the business logic and full technology support. All these can be developed by
student teams later on. However, we expect to present these ‘prototype’ Apps to other businesses
and seek collaborations. This is a long term proposal that will take some time for our university
to approve.

VI.F Availability of New Android Components: We finally have a good flow for our graduate
students. They will be able to build useful Android software components that undergraduates can
use. It may take two more iterations before the process is mature. Once that happens, the
undergraduate Apps will be more powerful and less of prototypes/platforms. They will come
close to having fully developed Apps ready to be marketed.

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

Pre-Launch (Fall 2008 - Summer 2009): We leveraged productivity lessons from a 6


year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and

engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

V. Challenges in Replicating Our Work:
We list here the problems we faced and our solutions that are working.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Our work suggests that the creation of undergraduate interdisciplinary teams for the development
of Android Apps is extraordinarily fruitful, not just for the sake of said Apps, but perhaps more
so as an introduction to team work environments that programmers, animators, and marketers
might find themselves in the future. Especially problematic, though, were the types of activities
that students themselves developed for working through application, process, and design issues.
Each small group appeared to understand the end product and their role (as programmer, graphic
designer, or marketer), but each was uniformly bereft of knowledge or skills for working
together in a coordinated, team-centered manner.

Their insight led to the following improvements in our Summer 2012 course: (1) Students did
not want to form teams by the second week of the course - they wanted some time to ‘settle
down’ and build connections. So, we now give them about five weeks before the above cited
team assignments start. (2) Non-engineering students had to wait for the engineering students to
complete a reasonably good prototype before they could proceed. Discussions (on promotional
video, market niche, etc) of business majors and asset (graphics, animation, etc.) creation of
artists were delayed as a consequence. So, we now have a quick prototype created with the App
Inventor17 that can then be used by business and arts majors to proceed on their own. This helps
provide for early synchronization and goal clarification for the whole team. (3) Students could
not meet their paired team mates from other disciplines. We now have scheduled ‘lab hours’ that
they sign up for. These are two hours during the week when they are available online to talk to
each other. The faculty members can schedule makeup or discussion sessions specific to
teams/sub-teams during these lab hours. (4) Students were overwhelmed with both discipline
specific assignments and team-wide project assignments. We now limit to five discipline specific
assignments, with several others provided as self-assignments. (5) Some of the engineering
students questioned the need for a team oriented project - they felt confident that they could
develop all of it on their own. We invited industry professionals to give guest lectures and also to
participate in team project evaluations. The teams hopefully now see that we are attempting to
create a microcosm of the real world in these courses. The business students usually grasp the
significance of this networking opportunity; but others have also benefitted). (6) The business
majors also misunderstood university IP (intellectual property) policies, which caused much
friction. Our Director for Technology Transfer has agreed to meet with the teams if they wish to
get clarification. Further, the Director can also help them start their business at our university’s
incubation center.

V. C Scalability and Transferability: We want to facilitate other faculty teams interested in
setting up similar courses. We will describe the stumble we had and how we are recovering from
it. During Spring 2012 we extended our collaboration to include the college of business, without
our staged process of due diligence. Apps developed clearly reached a higher plateau of real
world metrics9; but personality conflicts were more prevalent at both the faculty and student
levels alike. Fortunately, the three teaching professors on this paper were all enrolled during
Spring 2012 in the same team eLearning designer/ facilitator certification course at our
eLearning center. This was an intensive semester long course. This qualified us to teach the
eLearning course last summer. Our eLearning center23 fosters the “pedagogic integration of
technology into the design of teaching and learning processes through collaborative efforts with
faculty and other instructional technology personnel. It is where teaching, learning and

technology intersect to meet the rapidly changing educational, social and economic environments
in today's global society.” The eLearning course24 that we took used backward design of Wiggin
and McTighe 25 and assessment techniques based on Angelo26, Dunn27 and Mueller28. We
designed our joint summer course as a class requirement14. It allowed us all to appreciate the
teaching and learning pedagogy. This also helped us with regard to faculty team dynamics, since
we had the same vocabulary of teaching and learning outcomes, metrics, etc. Even then, we took
a step back during summer 2012 to a two-way joint eLearning course, between engineering and
arts students; we, however, did extend it to online teams. With the help of the instruction
designers and our own anthropology research, we now have a clearer roadmap on how to
develop a multiple-college course with BASE faculty and students15.

VI. Discussion:
We discuss here issues beyond the course boundaries.

VI.A Accreditation: Our various BASE disciplines are accredited under AACSB29, ABET3 and
SACS30. Though the individual keywords used vary, general themes in all these accreditations
include group-based activities, authentic learning, problem solving, critical thinking, and
systems-thinking. Starting from ABET’s criteria 3 (a- k) on student outcomes, we have
developed a framework of generalized learning outcomes to meet; apply STEM knowledge,
research and analyze, design and optimize, work on team projects, solve problems, become
ethical and responsible, communicate well, impact the community, learn life-long, achieve
excellence, and gain professionally. These metrics will be tracked through post-surveys of the
students, evaluation by the judging professionals, and long-term follow-up. They will not be used
to grade the students, but to appreciate better the steps to be undertaken (such as new software
tools for online learning and access to content, improved pedagogy, better assessment
techniques, etc.) to achieve those outcomes.

VI.B The Engineering Student: We believe that any engineering student can participate in this
course. The current course is listed as a semi-core course in the computer engineering curriculum
and thus attracts only computer engineering majors. We, however, find that current engineering
and computer science students have strong enough Java or programming background that we can
help them complete the Apps. Consider that we have taught this to high school students and that
a few arts students have taken our graduate course. There is a good reason for that: Android is
rich in its library support; one can build great Apps fairly easily. Since the Apps are different,
most students are willing to help each other. We also grade their work on an absolute basis which
reduces anxiety in out-competing others.

VI.C Tools Used: For the engineering aspect, we used open source tools (Eclipse, Java and
Android SDK) 4.10, 19. Open source tools in engineering are free and are supported by a strong
community spirit, which makes tutorials, code, Apps, quick help, etc., much easier to seek. Also,
more complex Apps can be built on pre-designed building blocks ( application programming
interfaces or APIs, libraries and components), thus facilitating easy learning and rapid
prototyping. We also chose the Android platform rather than the iPhone platform because of the
market trend of steadily increasing market share (currently at 60% Vs. 25% for iPhone). This
also implies that chances are that each team will have at least one or two students with the
Android smart phones with the latest operating system. Our course flow got better as the Android

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

infrastructure got more sophisticated. So, we are now well set to take advantage of a
sophisticated platform. The arts professor has struggled with accepting open source tools and the
componentization concept. Unlike the functionality goal of engineers, the artists take pride on
aesthetic beauty and uniqueness of their creation. The open source tools in art are not as well
accepted as are some of the commercial products (such as Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and
Camtasia), which incidentally are available at low cost to educational entities. We are, however,
slowly, making progress in incorporating open tools (such as Blender). The business tools used
are easy to obtain and use.

VI.D Marketing of Apps: We wish to market Apps through our university to secure some
funding to sustain the program. We wish to support two undergraduate students to help place a
select few Apps on the App market, maintain our website, tag the App assets, fine tune the tools
(yet to be developed), and generally improve the experience of students taking the course online
and F2F. Further, generating some revenue will motivate student groups to work together and
see collaborative opportunities beyond the university environment. This is not a problem for our
business students, but is for engineering and arts students. FAU has set up an account to receive
revenues from marketing the 25+ Apps in our portfolio. Some Apps will be marketed soon. We
could not market the Apps so far for three main reasons: (1) Our university has had its share of
turnovers. Decisions made by earlier administrators were reviewed by newer ones and the
characteristics of the account changed. However, the good thing is that currently it is a robust
structure that other universities can emulate. (2) Both software and hardware of Android smart
phones underwent rapid evolution. As an example, we used Nexus 1 and Android 2.2 version in
the first year; today, the versions to use are Nexus 4 and 7, and Android 3.1 and above. So, all
the Apps developed earlier have to be mapped to newer hardware platforms with different screen
sizes and resolutions. Of course, newer versions of the operating system do support all the earlier
software; so, that was not a problem. (3) All the colleges involved noted a popularity trend and
encouraged us to teach these joint courses more often. So, there were more coordination
challenges to face and less time to market the existing Apps.

VI.E Marketability of Apps: The marketability was decided by the industry professionals who
evaluated the projects as per a rubric9. The rubric may need some tweaking. A case in point:
We surveyed high school students on the marketability of our summer 2010 Apps. It was
interesting that some of the Apps that the adult judges considered not marketable were the ones
that appealed to them the most. So, the ‘marketability’ as defined here is limited to the opinion of
judging professionals. Putting all Apps on the market is not an option since much ‘production’
work will have to be completed to do so, as explained above. Also, some of these may have
missing some of the business logic and full technology support. All these can be developed by
student teams later on. However, we expect to present these ‘prototype’ Apps to other businesses
and seek collaborations. This is a long term proposal that will take some time for our university
to approve.

VI.F Availability of New Android Components: We finally have a good flow for our graduate
students. They will be able to build useful Android software components that undergraduates can
use. It may take two more iterations before the process is mature. Once that happens, the
undergraduate Apps will be more powerful and less of prototypes/platforms. They will come
close to having fully developed Apps ready to be marketed.

VI.G Entrepreneurship and Innovation: One may wonder whether our work can be considered to
be innovative from an economic entrepreneurship perspective. Merely getting students to work
on a real-world team project may not be considered to be entrepreneurial enough. Of course, we
are facilitating the formation of student-led small business and it will take much better shape
now that the college of business is a full partner. So, economic entrepreneurship is also evolving,
judging from the formation of a few student-led small businesses. We are also collaborating with
our local mobile technology consortium 31 in providing an avenue for student teams to meet and
interact with business and professional leaders in the high tech arena.

We also analyzed our work so far to verify that we are on indeed on a path of successful
innovation from yet another perspective, the wellbeing of a university. Denning and Dunham 32
define innovation as the art of getting people to adopt change. “Many inventions never become
innovations, and many innovations do not involve an invention.” They studied hundreds of
innovators and distilled their practices into eight categories. They suggest that innovation is a
continuing process of learning and practicing at increasing levels of skill. We have a good record
on innovation, with several patents, royalties and industry collaborations among us. We have
adopted their eight-stage process to combine change with existing practices and competing
interests, and achieve successful innovation. The mapping shows that our work on smart phone
Apps is proceeding concurrently at 4th to 7th stages. We believe that if we continue to make
progress under this frame of reference, outcome metrics for students (see above), the university
(such as increased enrolment, publications, grants, and revenue) , and the society ( such as small
business formation and economic impact) will show improvements.

Conclusions:
We have developed a fairly repeatable and robust process to enable multi-college collaboration
in developing potentially commercializable smart phone Apps for undergraduate students across
different colleges. We have also instituted mechanisms to continuously monitor team progress
and improve our teaching pedagogy to improve team and profession-oriented learning outcomes.

Smart Phone App Development: A Multi-College Approach

I. Abstract:
Smart Phone App development is exciting and timely, with potential for jobs, business
incubation and revenue. Successful industrial App teams bring together professionals in arts,
engineering, business, etc., to create elegant and user-friendly engineering marvels. Over the past
three years, we have worked towards creating a microcosm of this at our university at the
undergraduate level. State-of-the-art courses on this topic have been offered in three colleges,
synergistically and concurrently, with the aim to team up faculty members and students from
various colleges to work together towards this ideal. We have refined the process to a fairly
repeatable and robust process over the past three years. We will present the lessons we have
learned from our teaching and research that has led to this. We will provide sufficient
information so other professors can replicate our work.

II. Background:
Apple1 and Google2 have championed the seamless integration of functionality (an engineering
focus) with aesthetics, user-friendliness, relevance and empathy. It was our objective to develop
project oriented courses that integrated these aspects at the university level.

Our long journey towards this was inspired by ABET’s3 accreditation criteria 3(a-k) that map
well to team-oriented semester long projects, as envisioned and implemented in the capstone
projects of an engineering curriculum. However, not all the criteria can be met in the capstone
projects. The capstone projects also tend to vary much in quality and focus, leading to demands
on faculty and student members alike. This led us to utilize the lessons learned from a six- year
long industry funded project on significantly increasing engineering design productivity4. The
referenced paper documents the mapping of the concepts and processes from an engineering
design perspective to our academic project oriented three-course sequence. Further, once the
engineering aspects had been addressed, we (at first, just the first author; later, the first and
second authors, etc.,) had to start conversations with similarly inclined faculty members in other
colleges. We were able to achieve this by inviting them first to be judges, then mentors, and then
eventually teachers in joint courses. Once we had a core group of faculty members motivated to
collaborate, we jointly signed up for certification from our university for teaching eLearning
courses. This has allowed us to teach courses online and thus ultimately reach all potential
students who can now form and operate teams across our multiple campus sites and in the cyber
world. This will also allow us to potentially train professors elsewhere to replicate our efforts at
their institutions, to teach joint courses that are face-to-face (F2F), online, or a blend of both.

Bringing together engineering, arts and business majors would be a major challenge in academia,
since typically successful academic collaborations span only two colleges. However, we had to
work towards that ideal since these three areas represent the core of any successful App. We
believe we have achieved this. There, however, are two other core areas that are also equally
important: content providers and ethnographers. The former are needed to ensure that the App
developed is relevant to the domain being addressed. Inclusion of content providers is next on
our list. The inclusion of ethnographers was neither obvious nor planned for. It was a happy
accident when the third author from anthropology got involved as a content provider. He and his

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

students quickly realized that they are more effective as ethnographers, rather than as content
providers for social and medical Apps. We now realize that with their help these interdisciplinary
teams of business, engineering and arts majors can function as a team and resolve their ‘cultural’
and professional differences on a timely basis. So, we now strongly believe that every App team
to function in a predictable and goal-oriented manner must have members from business, arts,
sociology/anthropology, and engineering (BASE) in the team. We will detail their roles below.

We have offered such a joint course as a face-to-face (F2F) course at both undergraduate and
high school level several times over the past four years. We have also offered engineering
graduate courses that had both engineering and arts graduate students enrolled. However, we
need to make two remarks to clarify these general statements: (1) this paper will only focus on
the undergraduate student level collaboration (see Fig. 1), and (2) the joint courses have involved
anywhere from two to four disciplines, with more current ones being four-way. Reason for the
second item is obvious: Our collaboration has progressed in an incremental fashion over the past
four years. It was organic and was not planned for by the college administrators in a proactive
manner. However, we made presentations to these administrators and invited them to be judges
and guests of honor, to ensure that we communicated our goals well and secured their support.
With future successes in App marketing it will be easy to involve content providers as the fifth
partner. We have also offered it as an eLearning course, where it was a two-way collaboration;
however, the next offering will be a four-way collaboration. All these courses have been jointly
taught by a group of professors from different colleges. We provide sufficient details below for
others to reproduce our efforts at their institutions.

III. Overview:
III. A The Big Picture (See Fig. 2): We now have a three course sequence in place that
advantageously will synchronize the skill set and App goals at three different academic levels.
Graduate students in engineering and arts will create components/platforms in the Fall; Upper
level undergraduate students from BASE (business, arts, anthropology/sociology, and
engineering) majors will incorporate these and prototype Apps in the Spring; and high school
students will create fun and game Apps from these prototypes 5,6 in a three-week Summer course,
which may be easily and quickly marketable. The learning curve for the technology is too steep,
and mix of skills is too demanding, to achieve it all in one single three credit course. This
becomes clearer when described in the context of the taxonomy for educational objectives
prepared by Anderson et al.7. They use a 2 dimensional noun-verb matrix to identify the level of
a given objective, in terms of the required knowledge (A. Factual; B. Conceptual; C. Procedural;
and D. Meta-Cognitive) and cognitive process (1. Remember; 2. Understand; 3. Apply; 4.
Analyze; 5. Evaluate; and 6. Create). The higher alphanumeric value represents a higher level of
complexity7. The mapping for our course is as follows: High School course to levels (A and B,
6); Undergraduate course to levels (B and C, 5 and 6); and Graduate course to levels (C and D,
3). A business team to be successful, our ultimate goal to show economic impact of our
collaboration, will require expertise at levels (D, 5 and 6), reached with a mix of graduate and
undergraduate students who have taken our courses. The high school pairing may seem
paradoxical, but is appropriate here8.

III. B The Multi-College Course: This undergraduate course involves one faculty member from
each of the four disciplines in teaching their students. These students will complete their

discipline relevant material by mid-semester. During the semester they will undertake a team
project and work across disciplines in implementing a marketable App. The student teams
propose their Apps to a group of industry professionals by the mid part of the semester. The
professionals help the teams clarify their thinking and come up with a marketable App. The
teams then focus on this App and develop the App within about six weeks before the semester
ends. They make presentations to these professionals at semester end, who also grade their team
work. The final grade is dependent on both their individual/sub-team performance in their
individual disciplines (as determined by summative evaluations during the first-half of the
semester) and their team performance during the second half of the semester (as per a team
performance rubric recommended by the industry professionals9).

III. C. Timeline: Table 1 below provides the timeline of our joint teaching over the past four
years. This is provided only as evidence of the incremental refinement and exploration any
process goes through. Though the figures above present today’s well-formed pedagogy, the table
tells a more nuanced story of continuous improvement and academic realities. Our focus in this
paper is on the joint undergraduate (BASE) course.

III. D Course Sequence Details: This may be useful to other professors wishing to replicate our
efforts while avoiding our stumbles.

Pre-Launch (Fall 2008 - Summer 2009): We leveraged productivity lessons from a 6

First Year of Offering (Fall 2009-Summer 2010): The Apps from the engineering


year, $1M+ industry grant, to develop a three course sequence based on student capabilities at
three levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school). The Small Business Administration
(SBA) provided us with a $123K grant to facilitate this 10.

undergraduate student courses became the prototypes or platforms that high school students
used later that summer. Two engineering and two arts professors jointly taught the high school
students 5, 6. The high school students formed teams of three, with one student each responsible
for engineering (programming), graphics (asset creation), or business (project management and
promotional video creation) aspects. Nine engineering and graphics industry and academic
professionals evaluated the high school student team projects. Five of the 9 game Apps (fun
games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges. One engineering student started his
own company and is successful today11.
Second Year of Offering (Fall 2010- Summer 2011): The graduate engineering course

was offered. Students in such graduate courses developed a library of software components
(on imaging, robotics, web services, etc.). But the hand-off to lower level students did not occur
for technical reasons. In Spring 2011, a professor from Anthropology joined the team as a
content provider, so the undergraduate engineering students could focus on developing social
game Apps. These students were taught by the engineering professor and mentored by the arts
and anthropology professors. One undergraduate student team won the second prize in our
university’s business competition12. That business is viable today. The summer 2011 high
school course offered involved joint teaching by the engineering and graphics professors.
Seven engineering, graphics and business professionals evaluated the work of 9 student teams.
Five of the 9 game Apps (fun games) developed were deemed marketable by the judges.

students in engineering and arts took two concurrent courses taught by the engineering and arts
professors. The two professors covered material relevant to their disciplines. Three to five
engineering and arts students formed teams and focused on animation Apps. During Spring
2012, the teaching and student teams expanded to include all the four BASE majors. A total of
62 students from the four disciplines were concurrently taught by four professors, one each
from these four disciplines. They were tasked to develop Medical Apps. Each team typically
comprised of 3 engineering students, 3 business students, 1 arts students, and 0.5 anthropology
student. The anthropology students participated as social observers (or ethnographers). The
business majors were also content providers. Anthropology majors generated specific
recommendations to improve team dynamics at both student and faculty levels. Judging was by
a group of 8 BASE professionals 13. One team was able to leverage their App, raise venture
capital, and launch their company14. During Spring 2012, the first three co-authors also
underwent eLearning designer/facilitator certification, an intense semester long course. A joint
eLearning course was designed with the guidance of instructional designers15. Informal
ethnographic research results from Spring 2012 were incorporated.

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

Details on Summer 2012: Courses were offered at all the three levels. The graduate


course focused on software automation so components can be generated in a more robust and
comprehensive manner. This was taught by the engineering professor, but included both
engineering and arts students. One student used the tools to develop an ABET accreditation
software tool16. A joint undergraduate course was offered during Summer ’12 to arts and
engineering undergraduate students as an online course. Professors in engineering and arts
taught their courses concurrently. Nine teams of 3 to 4 students completed Apps and were
evaluated by industry professionals. A 3-week summer course for high school students was
also offered. We tried a variation of our earlier course. We used App Inventor17 for rapid
prototyping. These high school students compared the use of App Inventor and Java (with
Android SDK) for App development in terms of certain performance metrics (memory foot
print, response time and power dissipation). The former has limitations (high memory need and
App fragmentation), but is useful for rapid prototyping. Java, on the other hand, takes longer to
develop an App with, but the result is a more sophisticated App.

III.E Typical Course Flow: We present here details of a composite joint course as we expect to
conduct it in the future. It is based on multiple variations and combinations attempted over the
past four years. The syllabi of the four concurrent courses are documented at a team site15.

This is a joint teaching project that involves four faculty members from each of the BASE
disciplines. Each of the BASE professors will teach one course that is discipline specific. Each of
us will teach relevant material pertaining to our respective disciplines, then bring students
together (after a mid-term summative exam to ensure that the students could contribute
productively) to form cross-disciplinary teams to build mobile applications. All the courses have
three specified ‘lab’ hours, with students signing up for two. This facilitates their interaction. The
courses are on software and system development for smart phones (for engineers), animation and
graphics for mobile applications (for artists), Android App design and project management (for
business majors), and directed independent study (for anthropology majors). The first course
emphasizes a software component-based top-down system design approach for App
development. The second course deals with tools for asset (graphic and animation) buildup and
the aesthetic aspects in mobile application design. The third course focuses on business theories,
marketing strategies, project management, and work breakdown. The fourth course advises
anthropology students on research methods to observe, document, and (occasionally) advise the
project teams. Students meet regularly, separated by disciplines, and a few times together during
the class hours across the disciplines. They are encouraged to meet outside the class hours
(during the lab hours) with their team members from the paired courses. The hope is to mix
visual artists, analytically minded engineers, and venture-oriented business students together in
small teams to catalyze innovation, with anthropology students as ethnographers and moderators.
Since they have to form teams, we have a common assignment by the second week to post their
bios at a common Blackboard community site. They will have the next three weeks to
communicate with each other and determine the team make-up. We get involved if they are
unable to form teams on their own; we help them make up their minds. During the lab hours (see
below) the engineering and arts professors teardown our existing Apps. These are videotaped so
others can watch even if they missed the specific lecture. Since the lab hours are attended by all
of the students, independent of disciplines, it is an opportunity for interaction across disciplines.

Team Projects: By mid-semester (8th week), the students present their project ideas and get to
work creating the applications. To facilitate this, the combined team is assigned three weekly
common project assignments during 5th to 7th weeks: story-boarding of their App, technical
mockup with Balsamiq18, and prototyping with App Inventor17. The student teams make
presentations to the professors and industry professionals F2F or online and are given feedback
on feasibility (technical, artistic and marketing), uniqueness and useful links to find code and
assets. After that , by the 10th week, they start on their final three weekly project assignments, on
development of individual software components, graphic assets, and marketing plan; on
integration and testing; and finally on a portfolio presentation to well-respected local BASE
professionals to evaluate these Apps. The presentations (by the 13th week) includes a slide
presentation by the team, a three minute promotional video, a live demo with a phone, discussion
of the code and assets created, and a Q&A session. All the code, assets, documentation, & the
project folder had to be submitted by teams for a grade to be posted (by the 14th week).

Video production: The artists and/or business majors take the lead in producing a short video to
promote their team’s work. They use the storyboard to create a polished presentation showing
the features and uses of the mobile application. They used available video editing and effects
software. See Videos13.

Overview: The first half (weeks 1 to 7) of the semester is focused on discipline-specific
summative assignments. During weeks 5 to 14 there are project-specific formative assignments,
as cited above. During the second half, each week the students either have something in progress
to show or we work out problems in creating the graphics or software elements. Case studies and
tutoring are used extensively later in the course. Frustration and misunderstandings are to be
expected. To quote an anthropology student from our Spring ’12 semester “oh, how the forced
relationship can make a wonderful experience.”

Technology Plans: Based on student feedbacks, we are developing a virtual learning
environment, with a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the work of team projects online19.

IV. Results:
A total of 450 students from various disciplines and levels (high school students to professional
engineers) have undergone our program. Twenty five marketable Apps have been developed.
Some of them will be marketed through the university in the near future. Five of our student
teams have started small businesses to refine and launch their Apps (three of them are still
viable). We have included three screenshots of student team Apps here (See Figures 3 to 5).
More can be found online at our websites5, 13. About 200K global developers have visited FAU’s
Android site5. Three student led businesses are still viable. We get regular requests for graduates
to hire/partner with. So, it has been a success from multiple perspectives. The remaining work is
more on streamlining the operations and expanding to include all kinds of ‘students’ so true
innovation can be facilitated.

V. Challenges in Replicating Our Work:
We list here the problems we faced and our solutions that are working.

Even within a college of engineering, it is difficult to institute multi-disciplinary efforts,

V. A Interdisciplinary Collaboration: There were three types of variability that had to be
considered and overcome:

since the skill set and backgrounds of both students and faculty members limit the quality and
completeness of the project. To resolve this, we focused on reducing variability within the
engineering domain4 by the (a) use of a priori component development and design reuse, (b) use
of prototyped Apps, (c) access to sophisticated API (application programming interface)
libraries, (d) open source and local tech community support, (e) and clear separation of
summative (with exam and quizzes) and formative evaluations (with the projects judged by a
group of professionals). Graduate students helped with goal (a), while the work of previous
semesters by other undergraduate students provided the prototypes for the current group. This
met goal (b). Goal (c) was facilitated by Google’s release of Android APIs and a free SDK
(software development kit). Goal (d) was a consequence of both Google’s Android effort and our
own local effort to disseminate5. The last goal (e) resulted from iterative improvement during the
first two years, and the authors’ formal training in eLearning in the third year.
If we now wish to bring students and faculty members from various colleges (arts,

business, engineering, and content providers, such as nursing and urban planning) together,
differences in discipline-specific behaviors, perspectives, and focus may undermine the goal.
Even if professors worked together harmoniously, student teams may be impacted by individual
discipline specific behaviors. We invited faculty members from graphics, social science and
business to judge our engineering projects. This opened up discussions on the role of their
expertise, and their desire to participate more actively, along with their students. After this initial
exposure, these professors signed on to co-teach this semester long project course, thanks to the
willingness of the Chairs and Deans to support such collaborative efforts. Because of this two
stage involvement, the expectations were better understood and managed. This was an
incremental approach, first with joint teaching between engineering and arts professors during
the first year, which then extended to include a professor from anthropology during the second
year, and eventually a professor from business in the third year.

technology literacy21. A move to eLearning was necessary for two different reasons: Our
University is comprised of six different campus sites in south Florida, and we also wish to scale
it up so many joint collaborative teaching efforts could be underway, with different faculty
groups. During the third year, we took advantage of
for eLearning courses. More details are provided later.

Forming cyber-teams brings its own challenges of eLearning20 and information

training for designer/facilitator certification

V.B Team Dynamics: During spring 2012, anthropology majors joined other undergraduate
students to form BASE teams; they observed the team dynamics and cultural interactions. Six
anthropology majors generated valuable feedback. This research approach follows the design
based research (DBR) into learning, a practice-based research methodology 22. Their enquiry
brought to light a number of hurdles to overcome in the formation of interdisciplinary teams.
Foremost among them was the coordination of activities and this coordination ramified from the
top level (the professors) to the bottom (the students). The creation of teams depended greatly
on communication among the interdisciplinary professors, on coordinating activities in such a
manner that each individual discipline was proceeding in a manner that recognized the parallel
work of others. We now maintain a faculty team site that allows us to synchronize our activities,
but also provides transparency so students can be aware of the concurrent activities elsewhere15.

Our work suggests that the creation of undergraduate interdisciplinary teams for the development
of Android Apps is extraordinarily fruitful, not just for the sake of said Apps, but perhaps more
so as an introduction to team work environments that programmers, animators, and marketers
might find themselves in the future. Especially problematic, though, were the types of activities
that students themselves developed for working through application, process, and design issues.
Each small group appeared to understand the end product and their role (as programmer, graphic
designer, or marketer), but each was uniformly bereft of knowledge or skills for working
together in a coordinated, team-centered manner.

Their insight led to the following improvements in our Summer 2012 course: (1) Students did
not want to form teams by the second week of the course - they wanted some time to ‘settle
down’ and build connections. So, we now give them about five weeks before the above cited
team assignments start. (2) Non-engineering students had to wait for the engineering students to
complete a reasonably good prototype before they could proceed. Discussions (on promotional
video, market niche, etc) of business majors and asset (graphics, animation, etc.) creation of
artists were delayed as a consequence. So, we now have a quick prototype created with the App
Inventor17 that can then be used by business and arts majors to proceed on their own. This helps
provide for early synchronization and goal clarification for the whole team. (3) Students could
not meet their paired team mates from other disciplines. We now have scheduled ‘lab hours’ that
they sign up for. These are two hours during the week when they are available online to talk to
each other. The faculty members can schedule makeup or discussion sessions specific to
teams/sub-teams during these lab hours. (4) Students were overwhelmed with both discipline
specific assignments and team-wide project assignments. We now limit to five discipline specific
assignments, with several others provided as self-assignments. (5) Some of the engineering
students questioned the need for a team oriented project - they felt confident that they could
develop all of it on their own. We invited industry professionals to give guest lectures and also to
participate in team project evaluations. The teams hopefully now see that we are attempting to
create a microcosm of the real world in these courses. The business students usually grasp the
significance of this networking opportunity; but others have also benefitted). (6) The business
majors also misunderstood university IP (intellectual property) policies, which caused much
friction. Our Director for Technology Transfer has agreed to meet with the teams if they wish to
get clarification. Further, the Director can also help them start their business at our university’s
incubation center.

V. C Scalability and Transferability: We want to facilitate other faculty teams interested in
setting up similar courses. We will describe the stumble we had and how we are recovering from
it. During Spring 2012 we extended our collaboration to include the college of business, without
our staged process of due diligence. Apps developed clearly reached a higher plateau of real
world metrics9; but personality conflicts were more prevalent at both the faculty and student
levels alike. Fortunately, the three teaching professors on this paper were all enrolled during
Spring 2012 in the same team eLearning designer/ facilitator certification course at our
eLearning center. This was an intensive semester long course. This qualified us to teach the
eLearning course last summer. Our eLearning center23 fosters the “pedagogic integration of
technology into the design of teaching and learning processes through collaborative efforts with
faculty and other instructional technology personnel. It is where teaching, learning and

technology intersect to meet the rapidly changing educational, social and economic environments
in today's global society.” The eLearning course24 that we took used backward design of Wiggin
and McTighe 25 and assessment techniques based on Angelo26, Dunn27 and Mueller28. We
designed our joint summer course as a class requirement14. It allowed us all to appreciate the
teaching and learning pedagogy. This also helped us with regard to faculty team dynamics, since
we had the same vocabulary of teaching and learning outcomes, metrics, etc. Even then, we took
a step back during summer 2012 to a two-way joint eLearning course, between engineering and
arts students; we, however, did extend it to online teams. With the help of the instruction
designers and our own anthropology research, we now have a clearer roadmap on how to
develop a multiple-college course with BASE faculty and students15.

VI. Discussion:
We discuss here issues beyond the course boundaries.

VI.A Accreditation: Our various BASE disciplines are accredited under AACSB29, ABET3 and
SACS30. Though the individual keywords used vary, general themes in all these accreditations
include group-based activities, authentic learning, problem solving, critical thinking, and
systems-thinking. Starting from ABET’s criteria 3 (a- k) on student outcomes, we have
developed a framework of generalized learning outcomes to meet; apply STEM knowledge,
research and analyze, design and optimize, work on team projects, solve problems, become
ethical and responsible, communicate well, impact the community, learn life-long, achieve
excellence, and gain professionally. These metrics will be tracked through post-surveys of the
students, evaluation by the judging professionals, and long-term follow-up. They will not be used
to grade the students, but to appreciate better the steps to be undertaken (such as new software
tools for online learning and access to content, improved pedagogy, better assessment
techniques, etc.) to achieve those outcomes.

VI.B The Engineering Student: We believe that any engineering student can participate in this
course. The current course is listed as a semi-core course in the computer engineering curriculum
and thus attracts only computer engineering majors. We, however, find that current engineering
and computer science students have strong enough Java or programming background that we can
help them complete the Apps. Consider that we have taught this to high school students and that
a few arts students have taken our graduate course. There is a good reason for that: Android is
rich in its library support; one can build great Apps fairly easily. Since the Apps are different,
most students are willing to help each other. We also grade their work on an absolute basis which
reduces anxiety in out-competing others.

VI.C Tools Used: For the engineering aspect, we used open source tools (Eclipse, Java and
Android SDK) 4.10, 19. Open source tools in engineering are free and are supported by a strong
community spirit, which makes tutorials, code, Apps, quick help, etc., much easier to seek. Also,
more complex Apps can be built on pre-designed building blocks ( application programming
interfaces or APIs, libraries and components), thus facilitating easy learning and rapid
prototyping. We also chose the Android platform rather than the iPhone platform because of the
market trend of steadily increasing market share (currently at 60% Vs. 25% for iPhone). This
also implies that chances are that each team will have at least one or two students with the
Android smart phones with the latest operating system. Our course flow got better as the Android

Acceptedforpublicationatthe120thASEEAnnualConferenceandExposition,Atlanta,GA,June

CopyrightownedbyASEE

Authors: Ravi Shankar, Francis McAfee, Michael Harris, and Ravi Behara

infrastructure got more sophisticated. So, we are now well set to take advantage of a
sophisticated platform. The arts professor has struggled with accepting open source tools and the
componentization concept. Unlike the functionality goal of engineers, the artists take pride on
aesthetic beauty and uniqueness of their creation. The open source tools in art are not as well
accepted as are some of the commercial products (such as Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and
Camtasia), which incidentally are available at low cost to educational entities. We are, however,
slowly, making progress in incorporating open tools (such as Blender). The business tools used
are easy to obtain and use.

VI.D Marketing of Apps: We wish to market Apps through our university to secure some
funding to sustain the program. We wish to support two undergraduate students to help place a
select few Apps on the App market, maintain our website, tag the App assets, fine tune the tools
(yet to be developed), and generally improve the experience of students taking the course online
and F2F. Further, generating some revenue will motivate student groups to work together and
see collaborative opportunities beyond the university environment. This is not a problem for our
business students, but is for engineering and arts students. FAU has set up an account to receive
revenues from marketing the 25+ Apps in our portfolio. Some Apps will be marketed soon. We
could not market the Apps so far for three main reasons: (1) Our university has had its share of
turnovers. Decisions made by earlier administrators were reviewed by newer ones and the
characteristics of the account changed. However, the good thing is that currently it is a robust
structure that other universities can emulate. (2) Both software and hardware of Android smart
phones underwent rapid evolution. As an example, we used Nexus 1 and Android 2.2 version in
the first year; today, the versions to use are Nexus 4 and 7, and Android 3.1 and above. So, all
the Apps developed earlier have to be mapped to newer hardware platforms with different screen
sizes and resolutions. Of course, newer versions of the operating system do support all the earlier
software; so, that was not a problem. (3) All the colleges involved noted a popularity trend and
encouraged us to teach these joint courses more often. So, there were more coordination
challenges to face and less time to market the existing Apps.

VI.E Marketability of Apps: The marketability was decided by the industry professionals who
evaluated the projects as per a rubric9. The rubric may need some tweaking. A case in point:
We surveyed high school students on the marketability of our summer 2010 Apps. It was
interesting that some of the Apps that the adult judges considered not marketable were the ones
that appealed to them the most. So, the ‘marketability’ as defined here is limited to the opinion of
judging professionals. Putting all Apps on the market is not an option since much ‘production’
work will have to be completed to do so, as explained above. Also, some of these may have
missing some of the business logic and full technology support. All these can be developed by
student teams later on. However, we expect to present these ‘prototype’ Apps to other businesses
and seek collaborations. This is a long term proposal that will take some time for our university
to approve.

VI.F Availability of New Android Components: We finally have a good flow for our graduate
students. They will be able to build useful Android software components that undergraduates can
use. It may take two more iterations before the process is mature. Once that happens, the
undergraduate Apps will be more powerful and less of prototypes/platforms. They will come
close to having fully developed Apps ready to be marketed.

VI.G Entrepreneurship and Innovation: One may wonder whether our work can be considered to
be innovative from an economic entrepreneurship perspective. Merely getting students to work
on a real-world team project may not be considered to be entrepreneurial enough. Of course, we
are facilitating the formation of student-led small business and it will take much better shape
now that the college of business is a full partner. So, economic entrepreneurship is also evolving,
judging from the formation of a few student-led small businesses. We are also collaborating with
our local mobile technology consortium 31 in providing an avenue for student teams to meet and
interact with business and professional leaders in the high tech arena.

We also analyzed our work so far to verify that we are on indeed on a path of successful
innovation from yet another perspective, the wellbeing of a university. Denning and Dunham 32
define innovation as the art of getting people to adopt change. “Many inventions never become
innovations, and many innovations do not involve an invention.” They studied hundreds of
innovators and distilled their practices into eight categories. They suggest that innovation is a
continuing process of learning and practicing at increasing levels of skill. We have a good record
on innovation, with several patents, royalties and industry collaborations among us. We have
adopted their eight-stage process to combine change with existing practices and competing
interests, and achieve successful innovation. The mapping shows that our work on smart phone
Apps is proceeding concurrently at 4th to 7th stages. We believe that if we continue to make
progress under this frame of reference, outcome metrics for students (see above), the university
(such as increased enrolment, publications, grants, and revenue) , and the society ( such as small
business formation and economic impact) will show improvements.

Conclusions:
We have developed a fairly repeatable and robust process to enable multi-college collaboration
in developing potentially commercializable smart phone Apps for undergraduate students across
different colleges. We have also instituted mechanisms to continuously monitor team progress
and improve our teaching pedagogy to improve team and profession-oriented learning outcomes.

8. Anderson et al. discuss the difficulty in formulating the two-way matrix, as a simplification of Bloom’s
taxonomy. In their taxonomy, creativity is positioned at the highest level along the cognitive process. It
may seem paradoxical to place high school students at level 6 (‘Create’), above older and more mature
students. However, for App creation, one needs raw imagination devoid of real or imagined technological
limitations. We find that high school students are actually good at out-of-the box creativity. For example, a
Table Tennis App of our undergraduate students became a game of squirrels for high school students13.
