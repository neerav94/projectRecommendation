Abstract: Smartphones are the latest technology trend of the 
21st  century.  Today's  social  expectation  of  always  staying 
connected and the need for an increase in productivity are the 
reasons  for  the  increase  in  smartphone  usage.  One  of  the 
leaders  of  the  smartphone  evolution  is  Google's  Android 
Operating  System  (OS).  Our  paper  intends  to  address  the 
problem  of  measuring  the  distance  of  the  nearest  obstacle 
using  sound  waves.  The  implementation  has  been  done  in 
Android to make it useful for daily needs, especially suitable 
for the situations of sudden power cut. Whereas the Android 
app  finds  the  distance  of  the  obstacle,  the  purpose  of  the 
MATLAB  implementation  was  to  include  the  use  of  the 
Butterworth  signal-processing  filter  (a  band-pass  filter)  to 
reduce the inherent noise present in the environment to make 
the distance calculation more effective.

1. INTRODUCTION  
‘Acoustic’  refers  to  the  properties  of  any  object  that are 
related  to  sound.  While  determining  the  distance  of  the 
nearest  obstacle  from 
the  source,  we  need  some 
mechanism to capture the echo. To be audible and clearly 
distinguishable  from  the  original  sound,  an  echo  has  to 
travel to an obstacle at least 16.6 meters apart (Consider 
speed of sound in air = 332 m/s). However, to capture the 
echo from a nearer obstacle, we need a mechanism.  
Laptops, PCs and other devices with built in microphone 
can  record  the  sound  by  own  whereas  the  others  not 
having  built-in mic. needs an external mic. to record. In 
general, smartphones are equipped with microphones. 
Acoustic  range  finding  is  a  base  for  SONAR  (Sound 
Navigation 
that 
uses sound propagation 
as 
in submarine  navigation)  to navigate,  communicate  with 
or  detect  objects  on  or  under  the  surface  of  the  water. 
Active sonar  emits  pulses  of  sounds  and  listening  for 
echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location 
and  of  measurement  of  the  echo  characteristics  of 
"targets" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used 
before

the  distance 
calculation  is  possible  through  tiny  android  applications 
also.

2. BACKGROUND WORK 
We  can  find  the  use  of  such  an  application  in  nature 
itself.  Bats  are  not  equipped  with  envision  capabilities, 
hence  they  use  an  alternate  mechanism-transmit  an 
ultrasonic sound wave. The echo received is used to detect 
any  obstacle  in  their  paths  and  hence  their  flying 
mechanism is based on inherent acoustic distance finding 
capability.  As  we  have  already  mentioned 
the 
introduction, a lot of research work has been already done 
on how to use the sound signals to measure the depth of 
the water, or to detect below the surface objects (such as 
submarines, 
icebergs).  Some  other  applications  are 
helpful for blinds.  
 
A lot of apps are already available for Android which uses 
sound  recording,  e.g.,  the  voice  recognition  apps.  They 
use  the  default  recorder  available  in  the  mobile  phone. 
For  MATLAB,  we  need  to  use  a  microphone  with  the 
PC/Laptop in order to record the sound. 
 
For  accurate  measurements, 
introduction  of  noise 
reduction  filters  is  necessary.  The  reflected  sound  is 
generally  very  feeble  compared  to  the  original  sound. 
Noise  from  the  environment  can  distort  the  echo  by  a 
considerable margin. Thus we need to use the concept of 
band-pass filters (i.e., it will only allow a certain range of 
frequencies to pass) to remove the noise. The Butterworth 
filter  that  was  implemented  by  us  is  a  type  of signal 
processing  filter designed  to  have  as  flat  a frequency 
response as  possible  in  the pass-band. Though compared 
to  a Chebyshev Type  I/Type  II  filter  or  an elliptic  filter, 
the Butterworth filter has a slower roll-off (and thus will 
require  a  higher  order  to  implement  a  particular stop-
band specification), we used Butterworth filter because it 
has  a  more  linear  phase  response  in  the  pass-band than 
Chebyshev Type I/Type II and elliptic filters can achieve. 
Following are the images showing the gain of a discrete-
time Butterworth filter next to other common filter types 
(all the filters are of fifth order):

3. PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
Our  algorithm  to  find  the  distance  using  the  echo  is  as 
follows: 
Transmit sound. 
Start the recorder. 
Stop the recorder after a certain pre-
determined time. 
Analyze  the  recorded  sound  to  detect 
the instance of time at which the echo 
is received. (Using amplitude) 
From this time, subtract the delay that 
occurred  between  the  transmission  and 
the recording of sound. 
We get a time, say t sec. 
Distance travelled by sound in t sec = 
s = 332*t. 
Distance  of  the  source  and  obstacle  = 
s/2. 
 
The  above  algorithm  has  been  implemented  in  the 
android  by  using  the  MediaPlayer  class  to  generate  and 
transmit the sound and the MediaRecorder class to record 
the sound. The recorded sound has been stored in a buffer 
and  it  has  been  analyzed  to  detect  the  time  of  first 
reception of echo.  
 
The  above  scheme  has  been  modified  and  improved  in 
MATLAB to obtain a better result. We have provided the 
scheme  for  comparing  the  waveforms  of the transmitted 
and 
the  distance 
calculation  capability.  The  modified  algorithm  for  the 
MATLAB application is as follows: 
 Transmit 
using 
user-defined 
amplitude,  frequency,  volume,  sample 
rate,  delay,  transmission  time  and 
recording time. (This is done in order 
to analyze the waveforms easily). 
Start the recorder. 
Stop the recorder after a certain pre-
determined/user-determined time. 
Use  BUTTORD  and  BUTTER  functions  in 
MATLAB 
band-pass 
Butterworth  filter  on  the  received 
sound. 
Analyze  the  recorded  sound  to  detect 
the instance of time at which the echo 
is received. (Using amplitude) 
From this time, subtract the delay that 
occurred  between  the  transmission  and 
the recording of sound. 
We get a time, say t sec.

5. CONCLUSION 
The MATLAB implementation shows that the pass-band 
Butterworth filter can remove the noise in a very efficient 
manner  (from the waveform). For better results, we will 
try  to  equip  the  future  versions  of  our  app  with  noise 
reduction filters. This app can be as useful to the blinds as 
to  the  researchers concerned with acoustic range finders 
which can determine the range upto which the sound can 
travel  and    reflect  back  to  the  source.  They  are  also 
specifically  useful  in  situations  such  as  measuring  the 
distances between mountains.
