Abstract—The  evolution  of  mobile  devices,  especially 
in  these  modern  days,  has  drastically  changed  the  face 
of business. A mobile phone device is often expected to 
offer  computer-like  functionality.  These  days,  most 
mobile phone users find it somehow inconvenient to do 
some  tasks  using  their  computers.  Most  individuals 
prefer to  change positions while sitting, stretching,  and 
also  feeling  a  bit  more  comfortable  when  browsing 
through their computers. It can be very impractical to be 
confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse  while  sitting  5  or 
10  feet  from  the  computer.  Hence,  the  proposed 
application  is  meant  to  turn  the  hand  phone  into  a 
wireless keyboard and mouse with a touch-pad, through 
the  wireless  network.  This  prototype  is  proven  to  be 
able to perform  most of the actions a normal computer 
keyboard and mouse can perform.

development 

the  Android  Market.  The 
and 
improvement  of  an  existing  Android  innovation  has 
become a usual thing now in the Android Environment. 
Every  Android  developer  wants  to  design  or  create  a 
unique  application  that  has  a  lot  of  improvement  and 
advancement  towards  the  existing  applications.  A 
developer  who  has  just  built  an  application  might  end 
up  seeing  more  of  the  application  just  in  a  couple  of 
months. Due to the fact that Android is an open source, 
it has inevitably given Android developers the chance to 
improve  existing  work  and  as  well  create  what  is 
currently invoke in the market trend. As regards to this 
project’s aim, there have been existing works related to 
the  proposed  application  which  has  been  in  the  market 
since  last  and  earlier  this  year.  Below  are  some  of  the 
related  existing  Android  Remote  applications,  with  a 
brief outlines of their specifications.  

a. Gmote  [5]:  This  is  an  Android  remote  application 
that has been used to control a VideoLan Client (also 
known  as  VLC)  media  player,  with  basic  options 
such as play, pause, stop, forward track and backward 
track.  Its  advanced  feature  is  the  file  browser  that 
allows  it  user  to  pick  and  choose  what  to  play  and 
also  a  recently  added  feature  of  being  able  to  play 
some  of  the  media  files  directly  on  the  phone  as 
opposed  to  watching  it  on  the  computer.  However, 
this 
in 
controlling one program. 

remote  application  has 

its 

limitation 

b. myRemote  [6]:  This  application  is  very  simple  and 
easy  to  use,  easy  to  set  up,  and  it  is  an  excellent 
control for Home Theater PC (also known as HTPC). 
This  has  been  rated  the  best  Remote  control  for 
Windows  Media  Center,  compared  to  other  related 
application  of  its  kind.  The  only  limitation  for  this 
application is the poor skin design. 

c. gPad  [7]:  This  application  allows  users  to  define 
custom  remotes  via  key  strokes.  Its  limitations  are 
only  by  using  key  strokes  and  key  combinations,  so 
application  functionality  has  been 
limited.  The 
implementation  of  gPad  does  not  support a  two  way 
communication, i.e. the sending of data back to a user. 

d. RemoteDroid  [8]:  This  application  performs  as  a 
wireless  mouse  and  keyboard.  It  controls  the  touch 
screen  on  the  phone  into  three  sections,  just  like  a 
touch pad on a laptop. This is very similar to what the 
proposed  application  is  trying  to  achieve.  But  the 
drawback of this application is the user would need to 
memorize the application short cut keys if they want 
to  perform  functions  greater 
typing  and 
browsing through a particular media file. No custom 
buttons or controls are currently available.

Table 1: Comparison of Existing Remote Applications 

 

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote 
control  applications  either  from  Android  platform  or 
other  platforms  that  are  available  for  different  mobile 
phone  devices  like  Windows  Mobile  and  other  Apple 
applications. The analysis inspired the idea of designing 
a hand phone based computer controller which is able to 
play  VLC  Media  plays,  to  control  HTPC  and  so  on. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  prototype  is  able  to  perform 
click 
operations,  multi-touching,  multi-scrolling, 
zooming  and  pinch  gesture.  In  addition,  users  can  as 
well use the keypad function which works exactly as the 
normal computer keyboard where user can type to chat, 
write emails, search things and others.  

 

III.  Proposed System Design 

The aim of this application is to address the stress of 
an  uncomfortable moment with  the use of computer. It 
enables the user to search for files, click on the desktop 
applications,  play  with  media  such  as  forward,  rewind, 
pause,  run,  increase  or  reduce  the  volume  of  a  media 
file.  It  also  allows  the  user  to  do  multi-touch  scrolling 
and  pinch  gesture  for  zoom  in  and  out.  This  could  be 
achieved  by  installing  the  proposed  application  that 
emerges to the computer network via Wi-Fi which then 
connects  both  system  together,  then  comes  with  the 
command from the mobile phone that remotely controls 
the  computer.  The  system  architecture  is  shown  in  the 
Fig. 1 below.

Introduction 

currently 

In recent years, there has been a phenomenal growth 
in  mobile  or  handheld  computing  and  communication 
devices  such  as  mobile  phones,  personal  digital 
assistants,  personal  media  players  and  so  on  [1].  The 
evolution of mobile devices, especially in these modern 
days, has drastically changed the face of business. It is 
now 
attainable  with  our  knowledge 
infrastructure,  and  powerful  mobile  devices,  for  some 
individuals  in  doing  most  of  their  work  outside  the 
workplace  [2].  With  the  emergence  of  the  mobile 
phones  of  nowadays,  particularly  Apple 
iPhone, 
Android, HTC and Blackberry products, individuals can 
work  nearly  anywhere.  A  lot  of  mobile  applications 
have taken control over the mobile market trend [2][3]. 
Every day, new mobile applications are developed with 

its  own  compatibility,  making

purposefully to a particular mobile phone model and its 
specifications.

it 

Nowadays,  besides  using  computers  for  working 
purpose,  most  of  the  users  use  their  computers  for 
entertainment  purposes  such  as  watching  a  movie, 
sharing  photos,  browsing  music  or  playing  games. 
Sitting  on  a  particular  spot  is  never  a  fun  especially 
when  viewing  an  entertaining  media.  It  can  be  very 
impractical  to  be  confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse 
while sitting 5 or 10 feet from the computer. Therefore, 
remote  controls  or  wireless  mouse  and  keyboards  are 
also  available  for  computers  to  solve  the  limitation 
mentioned  above.  However,  these  remote  controls  or 
wireless keyboard and mouse have a fixed set of buttons 
attached to the device it has been attached and designed 
to control. A fixed distance from the computer would be 
another concern of using the existing remote controls or 
wireless keyboard and mouse. When sitting far from the 
computer, the user is unable to view clearly the items on 
the  computer  screen,  which  would  limit  them  in 
controlling the computer. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, some of the related Android applications are 
briefly  reviewed.  The  proposed  system  design  is 
discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the implementation 
process of the proposed system is explained. The testing 
scenario and result are reported in Section 5 and finally, 
the conclusion is given in Section 6. 

 

II.  Related Issues 

Android  platform  has  made  everything  so  easy  and 
achievable  in  its  environment.  In  line  with  a  research 
from  Gartner  [4],  Android  is  poised  to  become  the 
second  worldwide  mobile  operating  system  by  the  end 
of  year  2011.  There  have  been  lots  of  competitions  in

development 

the  Android  Market.  The 
and 
improvement  of  an  existing  Android  innovation  has 
become a usual thing now in the Android Environment. 
Every  Android  developer  wants  to  design  or  create  a 
unique  application  that  has  a  lot  of  improvement  and 
advancement  towards  the  existing  applications.  A 
developer  who  has  just  built  an  application  might  end 
up  seeing  more  of  the  application  just  in  a  couple  of 
months. Due to the fact that Android is an open source, 
it has inevitably given Android developers the chance to 
improve  existing  work  and  as  well  create  what  is 
currently invoke in the market trend. As regards to this 
project’s aim, there have been existing works related to 
the  proposed  application  which  has  been  in  the  market 
since  last  and  earlier  this  year.  Below  are  some  of  the 
related  existing  Android  Remote  applications,  with  a 
brief outlines of their specifications.  

a. Gmote  [5]:  This  is  an  Android  remote  application 
that has been used to control a VideoLan Client (also 
known  as  VLC)  media  player,  with  basic  options 
such as play, pause, stop, forward track and backward 
track.  Its  advanced  feature  is  the  file  browser  that 
allows  it  user  to  pick  and  choose  what  to  play  and 
also  a  recently  added  feature  of  being  able  to  play 
some  of  the  media  files  directly  on  the  phone  as 
opposed  to  watching  it  on  the  computer.  However, 
this 
in 
controlling one program. 

remote  application  has 

its 

limitation 

b. myRemote  [6]:  This  application  is  very  simple  and 
easy  to  use,  easy  to  set  up,  and  it  is  an  excellent 
control for Home Theater PC (also known as HTPC). 
This  has  been  rated  the  best  Remote  control  for 
Windows  Media  Center,  compared  to  other  related 
application  of  its  kind.  The  only  limitation  for  this 
application is the poor skin design. 

c. gPad  [7]:  This  application  allows  users  to  define 
custom  remotes  via  key  strokes.  Its  limitations  are 
only  by  using  key  strokes  and  key  combinations,  so 
application  functionality  has  been 
limited.  The 
implementation  of  gPad  does  not  support a  two  way 
communication, i.e. the sending of data back to a user. 

d. RemoteDroid  [8]:  This  application  performs  as  a 
wireless  mouse  and  keyboard.  It  controls  the  touch 
screen  on  the  phone  into  three  sections,  just  like  a 
touch pad on a laptop. This is very similar to what the 
proposed  application  is  trying  to  achieve.  But  the 
drawback of this application is the user would need to 
memorize the application short cut keys if they want 
to  perform  functions  greater 
typing  and 
browsing through a particular media file. No custom 
buttons or controls are currently available.

Table 1: Comparison of Existing Remote Applications 

 

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote 
control  applications  either  from  Android  platform  or 
other  platforms  that  are  available  for  different  mobile 
phone  devices  like  Windows  Mobile  and  other  Apple 
applications. The analysis inspired the idea of designing 
a hand phone based computer controller which is able to 
play  VLC  Media  plays,  to  control  HTPC  and  so  on. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  prototype  is  able  to  perform 
click 
operations,  multi-touching,  multi-scrolling, 
zooming  and  pinch  gesture.  In  addition,  users  can  as 
well use the keypad function which works exactly as the 
normal computer keyboard where user can type to chat, 
write emails, search things and others.  

 

III.  Proposed System Design 

The aim of this application is to address the stress of 
an  uncomfortable moment with  the use of computer. It 
enables the user to search for files, click on the desktop 
applications,  play  with  media  such  as  forward,  rewind, 
pause,  run,  increase  or  reduce  the  volume  of  a  media 
file.  It  also  allows  the  user  to  do  multi-touch  scrolling 
and  pinch  gesture  for  zoom  in  and  out.  This  could  be 
achieved  by  installing  the  proposed  application  that 
emerges to the computer network via Wi-Fi which then 
connects  both  system  together,  then  comes  with  the 
command from the mobile phone that remotely controls 
the  computer.  The  system  architecture  is  shown  in  the 
Fig. 1 below.

using  web  standards  and  accessed  through  a  web 
browser  [9].  Here  in  this  project  the  client  application 
was implemented. Based on the platform using Android 
Software  Development  Kit  [10],  this  application  was 
written using the Java Programming Language and was 
designed  to  run  on  a  customized  Linux-based  virtual 
machine called Dalvik. The developed client application 
has an .apk extension the interested users can download 
from the developer and installed directly to their mobile 
phone devices. Fig. 2 shows the program flow diagram 
of the client application. 

First,  the  application  program  starts  by  checking  the 
Wi-Fi  connection.  The  embedded  web  server  runs  in 
parallel  once  the  application  starts.  The  application 
pulls the xml file from the .apk file to generate the main 
screen and moves ahead to generate also the application 
Graphical  User  Interface  (also  known  as  GUI).  The 
application GUI awaits an input from the user and when 
the  action  has  been  performed,  it  sends  a  command  to 
the  Web  Server  which  then  processes  the  action  sent 
from  the  GUI.  Then  the  Web  Server  resends  back  the 
action  that  has  been  processed  to  the  Application  GUI 
which  then  updates  the  input  back  to  the  user  as 
expected.  

 

3.2  The Server Application 

Today’s  mobile  phones  are  having  more  computing 
power, running a server on mobile phones can do a lot 
more  help  in  running  the  device.  In  the  project  the 
server  works  as  a  pair  to  the  client.  For  without  the 
server  which  transmits  the  message  to  the  listener,  the 
application  itself  would  not  be  able  to  function.  To 
create  a  typical  web  server,  one  has  to  create  a  server 
socket  and  listen  to  the  desired  port.  Then  accept  the 
connection and finally process the request and send the 
response to the client. 

For  the  server  side  of  this  application,  a  java  server 
application  is  required  for  listening  to  client  activities. 
In  this  project  the  server  is  a  private  java  application 
server  which  has  been  hosted  by  the  application’s 
machine.  The  application’s  machine  can  also  be  any 
machine  where  Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE)  is 
installed. Fig. 3 shows the program flow diagram of the 
server application. 

Fig. 3: Server application flow diagram 

 

3.3  The Prototype Program Flow 

Fig.  4  shows  the  overall  program  flow  for  this 
application.  When  the  remote  control  is  run,  it  follows 
the  path  shown  on  the  figure  below.  After  application 
starts,  the  embedded  java  application  server  runs  in 
parallel.  Sound  notification  is  implemented  in  the 
proposed application so as to let users being aware that 
their  IP  address  has  been  validated  and  the  user  can 
proceed with the application.

3.4  Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 

The  Android  SDK 

is  a  Java  based  software 
development  kit  that  enables  the  developers  to  build 
applications  for  the  Android  platform.  It  includes 
development tools, source codes for sample projects, an 
emulator  and  the  necessary  libraries  to  create  Android 
applications. Applications are run on Dalvik which is a 
custom-built virtual machine that runs on top of a Linux 
Kernel [10]. The graphical user interface of an Android 
application is built from the libraries in the SDK using 
XML  and  the  graphical  input.  This  ensures  that  the 
scheme  created  by  the  developer  is  uniform  for  the 
application  and  between  applications.  In  an  Android 
application the user interface is created using View and 
ViewGroup  objects.  View  objects  are  the  fundamental 
units  of  user  interface  expression  on  the  Android 
platform [9].

Abstract—The  evolution  of  mobile  devices,  especially 
in  these  modern  days,  has  drastically  changed  the  face 
of business. A mobile phone device is often expected to 
offer  computer-like  functionality.  These  days,  most 
mobile phone users find it somehow inconvenient to do 
some  tasks  using  their  computers.  Most  individuals 
prefer to  change positions while sitting, stretching,  and 
also  feeling  a  bit  more  comfortable  when  browsing 
through their computers. It can be very impractical to be 
confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse  while  sitting  5  or 
10  feet  from  the  computer.  Hence,  the  proposed 
application  is  meant  to  turn  the  hand  phone  into  a 
wireless keyboard and mouse with a touch-pad, through 
the  wireless  network.  This  prototype  is  proven  to  be 
able to perform  most of the actions a normal computer 
keyboard and mouse can perform.

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote

3.4  Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 

The  Android  SDK 

is  a  Java  based  software 
development  kit  that  enables  the  developers  to  build 
applications  for  the  Android  platform.  It  includes 
development tools, source codes for sample projects, an 
emulator  and  the  necessary  libraries  to  create  Android 
applications. Applications are run on Dalvik which is a 
custom-built virtual machine that runs on top of a Linux 
Kernel [10]. The graphical user interface of an Android 
application is built from the libraries in the SDK using 
XML  and  the  graphical  input.  This  ensures  that  the 
scheme  created  by  the  developer  is  uniform  for  the 
application  and  between  applications.  In  an  Android 
application the user interface is created using View and 
ViewGroup  objects.  View  objects  are  the  fundamental 
units  of  user  interface  expression  on  the  Android 
platform [9].

On Android, permission is required to grant the built 
application  to  access  to  the  internet  in  performing 
certain  tasks.  The  developer  must  define  it  in  the 
configuration file of the application that it would like to 
use the concerned permission. If a user wants to install 
an  Android  application,  he  or  she  gets  a  screen  where 
by  the  required  permission  for  the  application  must  be 
confirmed.

Abstract—The  evolution  of  mobile  devices,  especially 
in  these  modern  days,  has  drastically  changed  the  face 
of business. A mobile phone device is often expected to 
offer  computer-like  functionality.  These  days,  most 
mobile phone users find it somehow inconvenient to do 
some  tasks  using  their  computers.  Most  individuals 
prefer to  change positions while sitting, stretching,  and 
also  feeling  a  bit  more  comfortable  when  browsing 
through their computers. It can be very impractical to be 
confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse  while  sitting  5  or 
10  feet  from  the  computer.  Hence,  the  proposed 
application  is  meant  to  turn  the  hand  phone  into  a 
wireless keyboard and mouse with a touch-pad, through 
the  wireless  network.  This  prototype  is  proven  to  be 
able to perform  most of the actions a normal computer 
keyboard and mouse can perform.

Introduction 

currently 

In recent years, there has been a phenomenal growth 
in  mobile  or  handheld  computing  and  communication 
devices  such  as  mobile  phones,  personal  digital 
assistants,  personal  media  players  and  so  on  [1].  The 
evolution of mobile devices, especially in these modern 
days, has drastically changed the face of business. It is 
now 
attainable  with  our  knowledge 
infrastructure,  and  powerful  mobile  devices,  for  some 
individuals  in  doing  most  of  their  work  outside  the 
workplace  [2].  With  the  emergence  of  the  mobile 
phones  of  nowadays,  particularly  Apple 
iPhone, 
Android, HTC and Blackberry products, individuals can 
work  nearly  anywhere.  A  lot  of  mobile  applications 
have taken control over the mobile market trend [2][3]. 
Every day, new mobile applications are developed with 

its  own  compatibility,  making

purposefully to a particular mobile phone model and its 
specifications.

it 

Nowadays,  besides  using  computers  for  working 
purpose,  most  of  the  users  use  their  computers  for 
entertainment  purposes  such  as  watching  a  movie, 
sharing  photos,  browsing  music  or  playing  games. 
Sitting  on  a  particular  spot  is  never  a  fun  especially 
when  viewing  an  entertaining  media.  It  can  be  very 
impractical  to  be  confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse 
while sitting 5 or 10 feet from the computer. Therefore, 
remote  controls  or  wireless  mouse  and  keyboards  are 
also  available  for  computers  to  solve  the  limitation 
mentioned  above.  However,  these  remote  controls  or 
wireless keyboard and mouse have a fixed set of buttons 
attached to the device it has been attached and designed 
to control. A fixed distance from the computer would be 
another concern of using the existing remote controls or 
wireless keyboard and mouse. When sitting far from the 
computer, the user is unable to view clearly the items on 
the  computer  screen,  which  would  limit  them  in 
controlling the computer. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, some of the related Android applications are 
briefly  reviewed.  The  proposed  system  design  is 
discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the implementation 
process of the proposed system is explained. The testing 
scenario and result are reported in Section 5 and finally, 
the conclusion is given in Section 6. 

 

II.  Related Issues 

Android  platform  has  made  everything  so  easy  and 
achievable  in  its  environment.  In  line  with  a  research 
from  Gartner  [4],  Android  is  poised  to  become  the 
second  worldwide  mobile  operating  system  by  the  end 
of  year  2011.  There  have  been  lots  of  competitions  in

development 

the  Android  Market.  The 
and 
improvement  of  an  existing  Android  innovation  has 
become a usual thing now in the Android Environment. 
Every  Android  developer  wants  to  design  or  create  a 
unique  application  that  has  a  lot  of  improvement  and 
advancement  towards  the  existing  applications.  A 
developer  who  has  just  built  an  application  might  end 
up  seeing  more  of  the  application  just  in  a  couple  of 
months. Due to the fact that Android is an open source, 
it has inevitably given Android developers the chance to 
improve  existing  work  and  as  well  create  what  is 
currently invoke in the market trend. As regards to this 
project’s aim, there have been existing works related to 
the  proposed  application  which  has  been  in  the  market 
since  last  and  earlier  this  year.  Below  are  some  of  the 
related  existing  Android  Remote  applications,  with  a 
brief outlines of their specifications.  

a. Gmote  [5]:  This  is  an  Android  remote  application 
that has been used to control a VideoLan Client (also 
known  as  VLC)  media  player,  with  basic  options 
such as play, pause, stop, forward track and backward 
track.  Its  advanced  feature  is  the  file  browser  that 
allows  it  user  to  pick  and  choose  what  to  play  and 
also  a  recently  added  feature  of  being  able  to  play 
some  of  the  media  files  directly  on  the  phone  as 
opposed  to  watching  it  on  the  computer.  However, 
this 
in 
controlling one program. 

remote  application  has 

its 

limitation 

b. myRemote  [6]:  This  application  is  very  simple  and 
easy  to  use,  easy  to  set  up,  and  it  is  an  excellent 
control for Home Theater PC (also known as HTPC). 
This  has  been  rated  the  best  Remote  control  for 
Windows  Media  Center,  compared  to  other  related 
application  of  its  kind.  The  only  limitation  for  this 
application is the poor skin design. 

c. gPad  [7]:  This  application  allows  users  to  define 
custom  remotes  via  key  strokes.  Its  limitations  are 
only  by  using  key  strokes  and  key  combinations,  so 
application  functionality  has  been 
limited.  The 
implementation  of  gPad  does  not  support a  two  way 
communication, i.e. the sending of data back to a user. 

d. RemoteDroid  [8]:  This  application  performs  as  a 
wireless  mouse  and  keyboard.  It  controls  the  touch 
screen  on  the  phone  into  three  sections,  just  like  a 
touch pad on a laptop. This is very similar to what the 
proposed  application  is  trying  to  achieve.  But  the 
drawback of this application is the user would need to 
memorize the application short cut keys if they want 
to  perform  functions  greater 
typing  and 
browsing through a particular media file. No custom 
buttons or controls are currently available.

Table 1: Comparison of Existing Remote Applications 

 

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote 
control  applications  either  from  Android  platform  or 
other  platforms  that  are  available  for  different  mobile 
phone  devices  like  Windows  Mobile  and  other  Apple 
applications. The analysis inspired the idea of designing 
a hand phone based computer controller which is able to 
play  VLC  Media  plays,  to  control  HTPC  and  so  on. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  prototype  is  able  to  perform 
click 
operations,  multi-touching,  multi-scrolling, 
zooming  and  pinch  gesture.  In  addition,  users  can  as 
well use the keypad function which works exactly as the 
normal computer keyboard where user can type to chat, 
write emails, search things and others.  

 

III.  Proposed System Design 

The aim of this application is to address the stress of 
an  uncomfortable moment with  the use of computer. It 
enables the user to search for files, click on the desktop 
applications,  play  with  media  such  as  forward,  rewind, 
pause,  run,  increase  or  reduce  the  volume  of  a  media 
file.  It  also  allows  the  user  to  do  multi-touch  scrolling 
and  pinch  gesture  for  zoom  in  and  out.  This  could  be 
achieved  by  installing  the  proposed  application  that 
emerges to the computer network via Wi-Fi which then 
connects  both  system  together,  then  comes  with  the 
command from the mobile phone that remotely controls 
the  computer.  The  system  architecture  is  shown  in  the 
Fig. 1 below.

using  web  standards  and  accessed  through  a  web 
browser  [9].  Here  in  this  project  the  client  application 
was implemented. Based on the platform using Android 
Software  Development  Kit  [10],  this  application  was 
written using the Java Programming Language and was 
designed  to  run  on  a  customized  Linux-based  virtual 
machine called Dalvik. The developed client application 
has an .apk extension the interested users can download 
from the developer and installed directly to their mobile 
phone devices. Fig. 2 shows the program flow diagram 
of the client application. 

First,  the  application  program  starts  by  checking  the 
Wi-Fi  connection.  The  embedded  web  server  runs  in 
parallel  once  the  application  starts.  The  application 
pulls the xml file from the .apk file to generate the main 
screen and moves ahead to generate also the application 
Graphical  User  Interface  (also  known  as  GUI).  The 
application GUI awaits an input from the user and when 
the  action  has  been  performed,  it  sends  a  command  to 
the  Web  Server  which  then  processes  the  action  sent 
from  the  GUI.  Then  the  Web  Server  resends  back  the 
action  that  has  been  processed  to  the  Application  GUI 
which  then  updates  the  input  back  to  the  user  as 
expected.  

 

3.2  The Server Application 

Today’s  mobile  phones  are  having  more  computing 
power, running a server on mobile phones can do a lot 
more  help  in  running  the  device.  In  the  project  the 
server  works  as  a  pair  to  the  client.  For  without  the 
server  which  transmits  the  message  to  the  listener,  the 
application  itself  would  not  be  able  to  function.  To 
create  a  typical  web  server,  one  has  to  create  a  server 
socket  and  listen  to  the  desired  port.  Then  accept  the 
connection and finally process the request and send the 
response to the client. 

For  the  server  side  of  this  application,  a  java  server 
application  is  required  for  listening  to  client  activities. 
In  this  project  the  server  is  a  private  java  application 
server  which  has  been  hosted  by  the  application’s 
machine.  The  application’s  machine  can  also  be  any 
machine  where  Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE)  is 
installed. Fig. 3 shows the program flow diagram of the 
server application.

3.3  The Prototype Program Flow 

Fig.  4  shows  the  overall  program  flow  for  this 
application.  When  the  remote  control  is  run,  it  follows 
the  path  shown  on  the  figure  below.  After  application 
starts,  the  embedded  java  application  server  runs  in 
parallel.  Sound  notification  is  implemented  in  the 
proposed application so as to let users being aware that 
their  IP  address  has  been  validated  and  the  user  can 
proceed with the application.

Nowadays,  besides  using  computers  for  working 
purpose,  most  of  the  users  use  their  computers  for 
entertainment  purposes  such  as  watching  a  movie, 
sharing  photos,  browsing  music  or  playing  games. 
Sitting  on  a  particular  spot  is  never  a  fun  especially 
when  viewing  an  entertaining  media.  It  can  be  very 
impractical  to  be  confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse 
while sitting 5 or 10 feet from the computer. Therefore, 
remote  controls  or  wireless  mouse  and  keyboards  are 
also  available  for  computers  to  solve  the  limitation 
mentioned  above.  However,  these  remote  controls  or 
wireless keyboard and mouse have a fixed set of buttons 
attached to the device it has been attached and designed 
to control. A fixed distance from the computer would be 
another concern of using the existing remote controls or 
wireless keyboard and mouse. When sitting far from the 
computer, the user is unable to view clearly the items on 
the  computer  screen,  which  would  limit  them  in 
controlling the computer. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, some of the related Android applications are 
briefly  reviewed.  The  proposed  system  design  is 
discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the implementation 
process of the proposed system is explained. The testing 
scenario and result are reported in Section 5 and finally, 
the conclusion is given in Section 6.

development 

the  Android  Market.  The 
and 
improvement  of  an  existing  Android  innovation  has 
become a usual thing now in the Android Environment. 
Every  Android  developer  wants  to  design  or  create  a 
unique  application  that  has  a  lot  of  improvement  and 
advancement  towards  the  existing  applications.  A 
developer  who  has  just  built  an  application  might  end 
up  seeing  more  of  the  application  just  in  a  couple  of 
months. Due to the fact that Android is an open source, 
it has inevitably given Android developers the chance to 
improve  existing  work  and  as  well  create  what  is 
currently invoke in the market trend. As regards to this 
project’s aim, there have been existing works related to 
the  proposed  application  which  has  been  in  the  market 
since  last  and  earlier  this  year.  Below  are  some  of  the 
related  existing  Android  Remote  applications,  with  a 
brief outlines of their specifications.  

a. Gmote  [5]:  This  is  an  Android  remote  application 
that has been used to control a VideoLan Client (also 
known  as  VLC)  media  player,  with  basic  options 
such as play, pause, stop, forward track and backward 
track.  Its  advanced  feature  is  the  file  browser  that 
allows  it  user  to  pick  and  choose  what  to  play  and 
also  a  recently  added  feature  of  being  able  to  play 
some  of  the  media  files  directly  on  the  phone  as 
opposed  to  watching  it  on  the  computer.  However, 
this 
in 
controlling one program. 

remote  application  has 

its 

limitation 

b. myRemote  [6]:  This  application  is  very  simple  and 
easy  to  use,  easy  to  set  up,  and  it  is  an  excellent 
control for Home Theater PC (also known as HTPC). 
This  has  been  rated  the  best  Remote  control  for 
Windows  Media  Center,  compared  to  other  related 
application  of  its  kind.  The  only  limitation  for  this 
application is the poor skin design. 

c. gPad  [7]:  This  application  allows  users  to  define 
custom  remotes  via  key  strokes.  Its  limitations  are 
only  by  using  key  strokes  and  key  combinations,  so 
application  functionality  has  been 
limited.  The 
implementation  of  gPad  does  not  support a  two  way 
communication, i.e. the sending of data back to a user. 

d. RemoteDroid  [8]:  This  application  performs  as  a 
wireless  mouse  and  keyboard.  It  controls  the  touch 
screen  on  the  phone  into  three  sections,  just  like  a 
touch pad on a laptop. This is very similar to what the 
proposed  application  is  trying  to  achieve.  But  the 
drawback of this application is the user would need to 
memorize the application short cut keys if they want 
to  perform  functions  greater 
typing  and 
browsing through a particular media file. No custom 
buttons or controls are currently available.

Table 1: Comparison of Existing Remote Applications 

 

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote 
control  applications  either  from  Android  platform  or 
other  platforms  that  are  available  for  different  mobile 
phone  devices  like  Windows  Mobile  and  other  Apple 
applications. The analysis inspired the idea of designing 
a hand phone based computer controller which is able to 
play  VLC  Media  plays,  to  control  HTPC  and  so  on. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  prototype  is  able  to  perform 
click 
operations,  multi-touching,  multi-scrolling, 
zooming  and  pinch  gesture.  In  addition,  users  can  as 
well use the keypad function which works exactly as the 
normal computer keyboard where user can type to chat, 
write emails, search things and others.  

 

III.  Proposed System Design 

The aim of this application is to address the stress of 
an  uncomfortable moment with  the use of computer. It 
enables the user to search for files, click on the desktop 
applications,  play  with  media  such  as  forward,  rewind, 
pause,  run,  increase  or  reduce  the  volume  of  a  media 
file.  It  also  allows  the  user  to  do  multi-touch  scrolling 
and  pinch  gesture  for  zoom  in  and  out.  This  could  be 
achieved  by  installing  the  proposed  application  that 
emerges to the computer network via Wi-Fi which then 
connects  both  system  together,  then  comes  with  the 
command from the mobile phone that remotely controls 
the  computer.  The  system  architecture  is  shown  in  the 
Fig. 1 below.

3.1  The Client Application 

There  are  essentially 

to  deliver  an 
application  on  Android:  as  a  client-side  application 
developed using the Android SDK and installed on user 
devices  as  an  .apk  or  as  a  web  application  developed

using  web  standards  and  accessed  through  a  web 
browser  [9].  Here  in  this  project  the  client  application 
was implemented. Based on the platform using Android 
Software  Development  Kit  [10],  this  application  was 
written using the Java Programming Language and was 
designed  to  run  on  a  customized  Linux-based  virtual 
machine called Dalvik. The developed client application 
has an .apk extension the interested users can download 
from the developer and installed directly to their mobile 
phone devices. Fig. 2 shows the program flow diagram 
of the client application. 

First,  the  application  program  starts  by  checking  the 
Wi-Fi  connection.  The  embedded  web  server  runs  in 
parallel  once  the  application  starts.  The  application 
pulls the xml file from the .apk file to generate the main 
screen and moves ahead to generate also the application 
Graphical  User  Interface  (also  known  as  GUI).  The 
application GUI awaits an input from the user and when 
the  action  has  been  performed,  it  sends  a  command  to 
the  Web  Server  which  then  processes  the  action  sent 
from  the  GUI.  Then  the  Web  Server  resends  back  the 
action  that  has  been  processed  to  the  Application  GUI 
which  then  updates  the  input  back  to  the  user  as 
expected.  

 

3.2  The Server Application 

Today’s  mobile  phones  are  having  more  computing 
power, running a server on mobile phones can do a lot 
more  help  in  running  the  device.  In  the  project  the 
server  works  as  a  pair  to  the  client.  For  without  the 
server  which  transmits  the  message  to  the  listener,  the 
application  itself  would  not  be  able  to  function.  To 
create  a  typical  web  server,  one  has  to  create  a  server 
socket  and  listen  to  the  desired  port.  Then  accept  the 
connection and finally process the request and send the 
response to the client. 

For  the  server  side  of  this  application,  a  java  server 
application  is  required  for  listening  to  client  activities. 
In  this  project  the  server  is  a  private  java  application 
server  which  has  been  hosted  by  the  application’s 
machine.  The  application’s  machine  can  also  be  any 
machine  where  Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE)  is 
installed. Fig. 3 shows the program flow diagram of the 
server application. 

Fig. 3: Server application flow diagram 

 

3.3  The Prototype Program Flow 

Fig.  4  shows  the  overall  program  flow  for  this 
application.  When  the  remote  control  is  run,  it  follows 
the  path  shown  on  the  figure  below.  After  application 
starts,  the  embedded  java  application  server  runs  in 
parallel.  Sound  notification  is  implemented  in  the 
proposed application so as to let users being aware that 
their  IP  address  has  been  validated  and  the  user  can 
proceed with the application.

3.4  Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 

The  Android  SDK 

is  a  Java  based  software 
development  kit  that  enables  the  developers  to  build 
applications  for  the  Android  platform.  It  includes 
development tools, source codes for sample projects, an 
emulator  and  the  necessary  libraries  to  create  Android 
applications. Applications are run on Dalvik which is a 
custom-built virtual machine that runs on top of a Linux 
Kernel [10]. The graphical user interface of an Android 
application is built from the libraries in the SDK using 
XML  and  the  graphical  input.  This  ensures  that  the 
scheme  created  by  the  developer  is  uniform  for  the 
application  and  between  applications.  In  an  Android 
application the user interface is created using View and 
ViewGroup  objects.  View  objects  are  the  fundamental 
units  of  user  interface  expression  on  the  Android 
platform [9].

On Android, permission is required to grant the built 
application  to  access  to  the  internet  in  performing 
certain  tasks.  The  developer  must  define  it  in  the 
configuration file of the application that it would like to 
use the concerned permission. If a user wants to install 
an  Android  application,  he  or  she  gets  a  screen  where 
by  the  required  permission  for  the  application  must  be 
confirmed.

c. Keypad Controller Page 
d. Menu Page (Preferences/Help). 

And  on  the  server-side  application  which  will  be 
installed  on  the  computer.  There  are  two  major 
functions. 

a. User  has  to  install  the  server  application  on  his/her 

computer. 

b. The server application installed should then be run as 

required.

Once  the  client  application  on  the  Android  device 
connects to  the server  application on the computer, the 
screen  on  the  Android  device  switches  to  a  touch-pad 
layout as shown above in Fig. 7. The large rectangle at 
the  top  is  the  mousing  surface  and  the  two  smaller 
rectangles  at  the  bottom  are  the  left  and  right  mouse 
buttons. The green keypad icon activates the keyboard.

Abstract—The  evolution  of  mobile  devices,  especially 
in  these  modern  days,  has  drastically  changed  the  face 
of business. A mobile phone device is often expected to 
offer  computer-like  functionality.  These  days,  most 
mobile phone users find it somehow inconvenient to do 
some  tasks  using  their  computers.  Most  individuals 
prefer to  change positions while sitting, stretching,  and 
also  feeling  a  bit  more  comfortable  when  browsing 
through their computers. It can be very impractical to be 
confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse  while  sitting  5  or 
10  feet  from  the  computer.  Hence,  the  proposed 
application  is  meant  to  turn  the  hand  phone  into  a 
wireless keyboard and mouse with a touch-pad, through 
the  wireless  network.  This  prototype  is  proven  to  be 
able to perform  most of the actions a normal computer 
keyboard and mouse can perform.

Introduction 

currently 

In recent years, there has been a phenomenal growth 
in  mobile  or  handheld  computing  and  communication 
devices  such  as  mobile  phones,  personal  digital 
assistants,  personal  media  players  and  so  on  [1].  The 
evolution of mobile devices, especially in these modern 
days, has drastically changed the face of business. It is 
now 
attainable  with  our  knowledge 
infrastructure,  and  powerful  mobile  devices,  for  some 
individuals  in  doing  most  of  their  work  outside  the 
workplace  [2].  With  the  emergence  of  the  mobile 
phones  of  nowadays,  particularly  Apple 
iPhone, 
Android, HTC and Blackberry products, individuals can 
work  nearly  anywhere.  A  lot  of  mobile  applications 
have taken control over the mobile market trend [2][3]. 
Every day, new mobile applications are developed with 

its  own  compatibility,  making

purposefully to a particular mobile phone model and its 
specifications.

it 

Nowadays,  besides  using  computers  for  working 
purpose,  most  of  the  users  use  their  computers  for 
entertainment  purposes  such  as  watching  a  movie, 
sharing  photos,  browsing  music  or  playing  games. 
Sitting  on  a  particular  spot  is  never  a  fun  especially 
when  viewing  an  entertaining  media.  It  can  be  very 
impractical  to  be  confined  to  the  keyboard  and  mouse 
while sitting 5 or 10 feet from the computer. Therefore, 
remote  controls  or  wireless  mouse  and  keyboards  are 
also  available  for  computers  to  solve  the  limitation 
mentioned  above.  However,  these  remote  controls  or 
wireless keyboard and mouse have a fixed set of buttons 
attached to the device it has been attached and designed 
to control. A fixed distance from the computer would be 
another concern of using the existing remote controls or 
wireless keyboard and mouse. When sitting far from the 
computer, the user is unable to view clearly the items on 
the  computer  screen,  which  would  limit  them  in 
controlling the computer. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Section 2, some of the related Android applications are 
briefly  reviewed.  The  proposed  system  design  is 
discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the implementation 
process of the proposed system is explained. The testing 
scenario and result are reported in Section 5 and finally, 
the conclusion is given in Section 6.

the  Android  Market.  The 
and 
improvement  of  an  existing  Android  innovation  has 
become a usual thing now in the Android Environment. 
Every  Android  developer  wants  to  design  or  create  a 
unique  application  that  has  a  lot  of  improvement  and 
advancement  towards  the  existing  applications.  A 
developer  who  has  just  built  an  application  might  end 
up  seeing  more  of  the  application  just  in  a  couple  of 
months. Due to the fact that Android is an open source, 
it has inevitably given Android developers the chance to 
improve  existing  work  and  as  well  create  what  is 
currently invoke in the market trend. As regards to this 
project’s aim, there have been existing works related to 
the  proposed  application  which  has  been  in  the  market 
since  last  and  earlier  this  year.  Below  are  some  of  the 
related  existing  Android  Remote  applications,  with  a 
brief outlines of their specifications.  

a. Gmote  [5]:  This  is  an  Android  remote  application 
that has been used to control a VideoLan Client (also 
known  as  VLC)  media  player,  with  basic  options 
such as play, pause, stop, forward track and backward 
track.  Its  advanced  feature  is  the  file  browser  that 
allows  it  user  to  pick  and  choose  what  to  play  and 
also  a  recently  added  feature  of  being  able  to  play 
some  of  the  media  files  directly  on  the  phone  as 
opposed  to  watching  it  on  the  computer.  However, 
this 
in 
controlling one program. 

remote  application  has 

its 

limitation 

b. myRemote  [6]:  This  application  is  very  simple  and 
easy  to  use,  easy  to  set  up,  and  it  is  an  excellent 
control for Home Theater PC (also known as HTPC). 
This  has  been  rated  the  best  Remote  control  for 
Windows  Media  Center,  compared  to  other  related 
application  of  its  kind.  The  only  limitation  for  this 
application is the poor skin design. 

c. gPad  [7]:  This  application  allows  users  to  define 
custom  remotes  via  key  strokes.  Its  limitations  are 
only  by  using  key  strokes  and  key  combinations,  so 
application  functionality  has  been 
limited.  The 
implementation  of  gPad  does  not  support a  two  way 
communication, i.e. the sending of data back to a user. 

d. RemoteDroid  [8]:  This  application  performs  as  a 
wireless  mouse  and  keyboard.  It  controls  the  touch 
screen  on  the  phone  into  three  sections,  just  like  a 
touch pad on a laptop. This is very similar to what the 
proposed  application  is  trying  to  achieve.  But  the 
drawback of this application is the user would need to 
memorize the application short cut keys if they want 
to  perform  functions  greater 
typing  and 
browsing through a particular media file. No custom 
buttons or controls are currently available.

Table 1: Comparison of Existing Remote Applications 

 

Table  1  shows  the  comparison  of  existing  remote 
applications in the  market.  There are  also other remote 
control  applications  either  from  Android  platform  or 
other  platforms  that  are  available  for  different  mobile 
phone  devices  like  Windows  Mobile  and  other  Apple 
applications. The analysis inspired the idea of designing 
a hand phone based computer controller which is able to 
play  VLC  Media  plays,  to  control  HTPC  and  so  on. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  prototype  is  able  to  perform 
click 
operations,  multi-touching,  multi-scrolling, 
zooming  and  pinch  gesture.  In  addition,  users  can  as 
well use the keypad function which works exactly as the 
normal computer keyboard where user can type to chat, 
write emails, search things and others.  

 

III.  Proposed System Design 

The aim of this application is to address the stress of 
an  uncomfortable moment with  the use of computer. It 
enables the user to search for files, click on the desktop 
applications,  play  with  media  such  as  forward,  rewind, 
pause,  run,  increase  or  reduce  the  volume  of  a  media 
file.  It  also  allows  the  user  to  do  multi-touch  scrolling 
and  pinch  gesture  for  zoom  in  and  out.  This  could  be 
achieved  by  installing  the  proposed  application  that 
emerges to the computer network via Wi-Fi which then 
connects  both  system  together,  then  comes  with  the 
command from the mobile phone that remotely controls 
the  computer.  The  system  architecture  is  shown  in  the 
Fig. 1 below.

3.1  The Client Application 

There  are  essentially 

to  deliver  an 
application  on  Android:  as  a  client-side  application 
developed using the Android SDK and installed on user 
devices  as  an  .apk  or  as  a  web  application  developed

using  web  standards  and  accessed  through  a  web 
browser  [9].  Here  in  this  project  the  client  application 
was implemented. Based on the platform using Android 
Software  Development  Kit  [10],  this  application  was 
written using the Java Programming Language and was 
designed  to  run  on  a  customized  Linux-based  virtual 
machine called Dalvik. The developed client application 
has an .apk extension the interested users can download 
from the developer and installed directly to their mobile 
phone devices. Fig. 2 shows the program flow diagram 
of the client application. 

First,  the  application  program  starts  by  checking  the 
Wi-Fi  connection.  The  embedded  web  server  runs  in 
parallel  once  the  application  starts.  The  application 
pulls the xml file from the .apk file to generate the main 
screen and moves ahead to generate also the application 
Graphical  User  Interface  (also  known  as  GUI).  The 
application GUI awaits an input from the user and when 
the  action  has  been  performed,  it  sends  a  command  to 
the  Web  Server  which  then  processes  the  action  sent 
from  the  GUI.  Then  the  Web  Server  resends  back  the 
action  that  has  been  processed  to  the  Application  GUI 
which  then  updates  the  input  back  to  the  user  as 
expected.  

 

3.2  The Server Application 

Today’s  mobile  phones  are  having  more  computing 
power, running a server on mobile phones can do a lot 
more  help  in  running  the  device.  In  the  project  the 
server  works  as  a  pair  to  the  client.  For  without  the 
server  which  transmits  the  message  to  the  listener,  the 
application  itself  would  not  be  able  to  function.  To 
create  a  typical  web  server,  one  has  to  create  a  server 
socket  and  listen  to  the  desired  port.  Then  accept  the 
connection and finally process the request and send the 
response to the client. 

For  the  server  side  of  this  application,  a  java  server 
application  is  required  for  listening  to  client  activities. 
In  this  project  the  server  is  a  private  java  application 
server  which  has  been  hosted  by  the  application’s 
machine.  The  application’s  machine  can  also  be  any 
machine  where  Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE)  is 
installed. Fig. 3 shows the program flow diagram of the 
server application. 

Fig. 3: Server application flow diagram 

 

3.3  The Prototype Program Flow 

Fig.  4  shows  the  overall  program  flow  for  this 
application.  When  the  remote  control  is  run,  it  follows 
the  path  shown  on  the  figure  below.  After  application 
starts,  the  embedded  java  application  server  runs  in 
parallel.  Sound  notification  is  implemented  in  the 
proposed application so as to let users being aware that 
their  IP  address  has  been  validated  and  the  user  can 
proceed with the application.

3.4  Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 

The  Android  SDK 

is  a  Java  based  software 
development  kit  that  enables  the  developers  to  build 
applications  for  the  Android  platform.  It  includes 
development tools, source codes for sample projects, an 
emulator  and  the  necessary  libraries  to  create  Android 
applications. Applications are run on Dalvik which is a 
custom-built virtual machine that runs on top of a Linux 
Kernel [10]. The graphical user interface of an Android 
application is built from the libraries in the SDK using 
XML  and  the  graphical  input.  This  ensures  that  the 
scheme  created  by  the  developer  is  uniform  for  the 
application  and  between  applications.  In  an  Android 
application the user interface is created using View and 
ViewGroup  objects.  View  objects  are  the  fundamental 
units  of  user  interface  expression  on  the  Android 
platform [9].

On Android, permission is required to grant the built 
application  to  access  to  the  internet  in  performing 
certain  tasks.  The  developer  must  define  it  in  the 
configuration file of the application that it would like to 
use the concerned permission. If a user wants to install 
an  Android  application,  he  or  she  gets  a  screen  where 
by  the  required  permission  for  the  application  must  be 
confirmed.

IV.  Implementation Process  

The  main  purpose  of  the  development  of  this 
prototype is to help the users remotely use their mobile 
devices  as  an  ease  to  access  their  computers  via  a 
limited distance.  This application is said to increase the 
level  of  relaxation,  save  cost,  and 
the 
convenience in controlling the computers.

4.1  Prototype Functionalities 

There are four major functions that can be performed 
by  the  installed  client-side  application  on  the  device. 
They are; 

a. I.P Address Login Page 
b. Touch Pad Layout Screen Page 
c. Keypad Controller Page 
d. Menu Page (Preferences/Help). 

And  on  the  server-side  application  which  will  be 
installed  on  the  computer.  There  are  two  major 
functions. 

a. User  has  to  install  the  server  application  on  his/her 

computer. 

b. The server application installed should then be run as 

required. 

 

4.2  Prototype Graphical User Interface  

a. IP Address Login Page

Once  the  client  application  on  the  Android  device 
connects to  the server  application on the computer, the 
screen  on  the  Android  device  switches  to  a  touch-pad 
layout as shown above in Fig. 7. The large rectangle at 
the  top  is  the  mousing  surface  and  the  two  smaller 
rectangles  at  the  bottom  are  the  left  and  right  mouse 
buttons. The green keypad icon activates the keyboard. 
Here 
to  play  along  as 
implemented.  The  activities  to  be  carried  out  here  on 
the remote touch-pad screen are: Multi-scrolling, Multi-
touching,  Pinch-gesture  and  users  can  as  well  use  the 
touch-pad mouse button, if the user does not prefer the 
multi-accelerator  features.  And  also  between  the  left 
and right mouse buttons is the keypad’s icon for typing 
purpose.

Fig.  6  shows  the  IP  address  login  page,  where  users 
are required to key in the IP address as appeared on the 
servers  interface  screen.  Then,  the  connect  button  for 
connection  between  both  machines  is  clicked  so  as  to 
generate the desired output. One of the extra features of 
this application is introducing a sound/voice notification 
that  allows  the  user  to  know whether  the  connection  is 
successfully connected and is ready to use. 

 

b. Touch Pad Layout Screen Page

Other than this, an online survey has been conducted 
to collect the feedback from the public regarding to the 
usage  of  the  mobile  phone  as  a  controller  on  the 
computer  or  laptop  via  wireless  network.  This  survey 
has received responses from 51 potential users  all over 
the world. Most of the participants own a mobile phone 
and  94%  of  them  have  used  the  mobile  application 
which  shows  that  mobile  application  is  getting popular 
among the mobile phone users.  

In this survey, 52% of participants  have heard about 
the Android remote control application and 63% of the 
participants  are  satisfied  with  the  overall  performance 
of  the  application.  Most  of  the  participants  pose  a 
positive  attitude  on  the  application  and  89%  of  them 
feel  comfortable  with  the  idea  of  preferring  to  use  the 
device. Besides, 35% of them are willing to try out the 
application even when they have no android device and 
40%  of  them  are  as  well  willing  to  continue  in  the 
advancement of the project. 

 

VI.  Conclusion 

This project explores the possibility of controlling the 
computer remotely using an Android phone device. The 
proposed prototype is able to control a lot of operations 
a normal computer keyboard and mouse would perform. 
It  practically  turns  a  mobile  phone  into  a  wireless 
keyboard  and  mouse  using  a  wireless  network  via  a 
portable  mobile  device  running  under  an  Android 
Platform Operating System. It helps mobile phone users 
on  facilitating  their  work  in  study  life,  home  life  or 
working  life,  where  the  use  of  the  prototype  helps  in 
easing the device control. 

It is proven that this prototype would relieve a pain in 
the  neck  and  also  the  normal  back  ache  due  to 
constantly sitting at a particular place. With the help of 
this  prototype, 
these  stressful  moments  will  be 
minimized  as  users  will  be  having  a  very  relaxed 
position  as  intended.  This  is  a  convenient  application 
for  simple  operations  and  for  manipulating  such 
computer  without 
the  keyboard  and  mouse  been 
connected.
