ABSTRACT 

With the advancement of urbanization, how to make the city taxi system efficiently operate is an important 
problem in public transportation. The traditional cruise or point-point type guest-looking ways lead to the 
waste of resources, high operation cost and long passengers' waiting time. This is because the information 
transmission between the taxi and passenger is not real-time. This paper implements a taxi calling system 
based on intelligent mobile terminal, by which the passengers and the taxi driver can exchange information 
anytime. It can analyze the randomly appeared personalized passenger transport demand and timely transfer 
it to the appropriate service provider (cab), so as to fully use the existing taxi service potential, promote the 
improvement and development of city bus system, improve the quality of urban residents and promote the 
quality of the city. This paper tests the city taxi calling system through the actual system and simulation 
methods. The experimental results show that the use of the system can reduce the taxi empty loading rate 
by 68%, and the average passenger waiting time by 73%.

The  system  is  composed  of  a  taxi  car  node, 
passenger hand-hold terminal node and the monitor 
node. 

location 

The  structures  of  taxi  car  nodes  and  passenger 
hand-hold terminal nodes are the same, and they are 
made  up  of  the  following  several  modules:  a  car 
GPS  module  is  mainly  used  to  record  the  current 
user’s  geographic 
information;  Taxi 
display interface is used to display the geographical 
position  in  Baidu  map;  Taxi  condition  monitoring 
module  is  mainly  used  to  manage  the  changes  of 
user’s  state;  The  wireless  connection  module  is 
mainly  used  to  exchange  information  between  the 
client terminal and server; Taxi terminal software is 
mainly  used  to  adjust  the  integration  of  the  client 
terminal  position 
information  and  baidu  map 
information. The server monitoring node is mainly 
composed  of  wireless  connection  module  and 
historical information storage inquires. The former 
is responsible for the exchange of data between the 
client  and  the  server  data;  the  later  is  responsible 
for recording and inquires the historical information 
module. 

The car GPS module is the first to operate. It is 
to  transmit  the  location  information  of  the  taxi 
terminal  and  passenger  terminal  from  the  wireless 
connection module to the backbone, then the server 
wireless  connection  module  is  responsible  for 
receiving, and the final data flow to the server. The 

Technical principles: 
As shown in figure 1, the mobile phone terminals 
of  passengers  and  the  driver  are  integrated  with 
GPS  node  equipment.  No  matter  where  the  users, 
the  satellite  positioning  can  find  the  accurate 
position,  and  reflect  it  in  Baidu  map.  So  the  not-
taken taxi driver’s position and action can be a real 
time control of the passengers in need of services. 
Meanwhile,  the  driver  can  also  know  the  nearby 
call  of  the  passengers,  which  can  easily  get  the 
position of the passengers. 

In addition, the taxi and cell phone can pass the 
information  through  the  GSM  to  the  backbone. 
Then,  the  taxi  company  and  traffic  management 
department can monitor the current city taxi service 
information,  do  statistics  and  analyze,  thus  for  the 
company and municipal to decide. 

The  passengers’  login  interface  includes  the 
and  making 

responds, 

listening, 

states  of 
appointments. 

1.  The  passengers  can  observe  the  driver  and 
passengers  users  around  through  the  Baidu  map, 
and when needs service, he can send call request to 
the sever, thus he is into the call request state; when 
the  passenger  is  to  cancel  the  call  request,  he  will 
come back to the listening state. 

2.  Once  the  passengers’  call  request  has  been 
responded by the driver, the passengers can choose 
to response his driver by matching, then he is into 
the reservation status. 

3. The passengers in booking condition cancel or 
cancel  after  the  appointment  will  return  to  the 
listening status.

ABSTRACT 

With the advancement of urbanization, how to make the city taxi system efficiently operate is an important 
problem in public transportation. The traditional cruise or point-point type guest-looking ways lead to the 
waste of resources, high operation cost and long passengers' waiting time. This is because the information 
transmission between the taxi and passenger is not real-time. This paper implements a taxi calling system 
based on intelligent mobile terminal, by which the passengers and the taxi driver can exchange information 
anytime. It can analyze the randomly appeared personalized passenger transport demand and timely transfer 
it to the appropriate service provider (cab), so as to fully use the existing taxi service potential, promote the 
improvement and development of city bus system, improve the quality of urban residents and promote the 
quality of the city. This paper tests the city taxi calling system through the actual system and simulation 
methods. The experimental results show that the use of the system can reduce the taxi empty loading rate 
by 68%, and the average passenger waiting time by 73%.

and  the  driver.  Thus,  the  demanders  and  service 
providers can't completely  master real-time supply 
and demand, so lead to the resources idle, and there 
are waiting and inconvenience. 

The city taxi system is responsible for about 20% 
of  the  passenger  capacity  domestically,  and  along 
with  the  acceleration  of  urbanization  and  urban 
public  transport  system,  the  passenger  capacity  of 
the  taxi  takes  will  further  improve.  However,  the 
growing  user  needs  of  taxi  system  bring  heavy 
pressure.  Due  to  the  shortcomings  of  management 
and  usage  way,  the  existing  taxi  system  operation 
cost is higher, and the passenger efficiency is low. 
The traditional ways looking for guest include 
1.  Cruise  type:  the  taxi  blindly  cruises  among 
blocks  to  look  for  tourists.  It  is  lack  of  clear 
purpose.  Although 
to  find 
passengers, the schedule time is too long, resources 
the  operating  costs  will  be 
will  be  wasted, 
increased,  and 
the  economic  benefit  will  be 
reduced.  What’s  more,  it  can  increase  the  road 
congestion. 

it  has  a  chance 

2. Point-point type: the taxi parks in the potential 
area  to  wait  for  passengers.  This  way  can  disturb 
the  order  of  parking  areas,  and  the  speculative 
approach  also  often  leads  to  a  long  wait  but  no 
tourists, causing the waste of time. 

The  defects  of  the  above  two  ways  can  not 
establish real-time contacts between the passengers 

The existing taxi calling and scheduling methods 

can be classified into the following several kinds: 

through 

1.  Manual  call:  the  passengers  call  a  taxi 
company  service 
the  communication 
equipment,  and  then  the  service  counter  inquires 
and  informs  the  free  taxi  near  the  position  of  the 
passengers. This way can not locates accurate, and 
the labor cost is higher. 

2.  Fixed  site  type:  the  recently  proposed  taxi 
calling systems can be called as the fixed site type. 
The  taxi  company  or  the  traffic  management 
department in the city build many fixed stations, so 
the  passengers  in  need  of  a  taxi  can  walk  to  the 
nearest  taxi  station,  then  send  the  station  numbers 
to  the  taxi  site  dispatching  center,  or  call  the 
dispatch center. The dispatching center assigns the 
nearest free rental vehicles to serve the passengers. 
But the taxi stops set in the city blocks may not too 
much,  and  the  passengers  in  need  of  service  are 
often  not  near  the  site.  Thus,  that  increases  the 
passengers' waiting time, and reduces the taxi agile 
convenience.

AND KEY TECHNOLOGY 
 

The  system  is  composed  of  a  taxi  car  node, 
passenger hand-hold terminal node and the monitor 
node. 

location 

The  structures  of  taxi  car  nodes  and  passenger 
hand-hold terminal nodes are the same, and they are 
made  up  of  the  following  several  modules:  a  car 
GPS  module  is  mainly  used  to  record  the  current 
user’s  geographic 
information;  Taxi 
display interface is used to display the geographical 
position  in  Baidu  map;  Taxi  condition  monitoring 
module  is  mainly  used  to  manage  the  changes  of 
user’s  state;  The  wireless  connection  module  is 
mainly  used  to  exchange  information  between  the 
client terminal and server; Taxi terminal software is 
mainly  used  to  adjust  the  integration  of  the  client 
terminal  position 
information  and  baidu  map 
information. The server monitoring node is mainly 
composed  of  wireless  connection  module  and 
historical information storage inquires. The former 
is responsible for the exchange of data between the 
client  and  the  server  data;  the  later  is  responsible 
for recording and inquires the historical information 
module. 

The car GPS module is the first to operate. It is 
to  transmit  the  location  information  of  the  taxi 
terminal  and  passenger  terminal  from  the  wireless 
connection module to the backbone, then the server 
wireless  connection  module  is  responsible  for 
receiving, and the final data flow to the server. The 

Technical principles: 
As shown in figure 1, the mobile phone terminals 
of  passengers  and  the  driver  are  integrated  with 
GPS  node  equipment.  No  matter  where  the  users, 
the  satellite  positioning  can  find  the  accurate 
position,  and  reflect  it  in  Baidu  map.  So  the  not-
taken taxi driver’s position and action can be a real 
time control of the passengers in need of services. 
Meanwhile,  the  driver  can  also  know  the  nearby 
call  of  the  passengers,  which  can  easily  get  the 
position of the passengers. 

In addition, the taxi and cell phone can pass the 
information  through  the  GSM  to  the  backbone. 
Then,  the  taxi  company  and  traffic  management 
department can monitor the current city taxi service 
information,  do  statistics  and  analyze,  thus  for  the 
company and municipal to decide. 

The  passengers’  login  interface  includes  the 
and  making 

responds, 

listening, 

states  of 
appointments. 

1.  The  passengers  can  observe  the  driver  and 
passengers  users  around  through  the  Baidu  map, 
and when needs service, he can send call request to 
the sever, thus he is into the call request state; when 
the  passenger  is  to  cancel  the  call  request,  he  will 
come back to the listening state. 

2.  Once  the  passengers’  call  request  has  been 
responded by the driver, the passengers can choose 
to response his driver by matching, then he is into 
the reservation status. 

3. The passengers in booking condition cancel or 
cancel  after  the  appointment  will  return  to  the 
listening status.

The  states  of  driver  after  login  can  be  divided 

into monitor, response, and making appointments. 

1.  The  driver  can  see  other  drivers  around  and 
the  other  passengers  users.  When  the  passengers 
send call signal to the server, the driver client will 
show  the  coordinates  in  the  flicker,  the  driver  can

2.  When  passengers  accept 

the  driver’s 
reservation  invitation,  it  means  the  matching  is 
successful. Before the cancel, the drivers can go to 
the  destination  to  achieve  the  appointment,  if  the 
passengers  cancel  the  reservation,  the  driver  goes 
back to the listening state, and he can response the 
passenger’s reservation again.

the  simulation  time  is  1  to  941.  Let’s  see  the 
changes of number of not-taken taxis. 

Analysis on the Number of Not- taken Taxi 
In the test process, there are three variables: the 
number of input taxis, passengers’ appear rate, and 
the  number of not-taken taxis. Here, we fix the taxi 
input quantity, and the passengers’ appear rate, and 
then simulate number of not-taken taxis for variable 

When the operation is stable, the number of not-
taken taxis will increase as the the number of taxi in 
operation increases. It is shown in figure 3.

4.  CHAPTER 4:  CONCLUSION  
 

intelligent  mobile 

This  paper  implements  a  taxi  calling  system 
based  on 
terminal.  The 
experimental results show that the use of the system 
can reduce the empty loading rate by 68%, and the 
taxi passenger average waiting time reduce by 73%. 
This  system  is  a  prototype  system,  so  its  further 
work  is  to  increase  the  reliability  of  information 
transmission.
