INTRODUCTION 

In today's  world of automation, time is equivalent to  money. Doing the  work on the  go is the  need of the  hour. 

The major problem these days arises in the organization is, for performing even the small task the user has to input the data 

manually  into  the  corresponding  software  on  the  computer.  This  becomes  very  time  consuming  and  tedious  task  for  the 

user. Results for strategic decisions are required every now and then, but, on the other hand, it takes a long time for the user 

to obtain the results. Archaic aims on solving all the above problems on the go by just using their mobile phones.  

The project aims at using scanning and comparing techniques intended to identify printed text and equations into a 

digital  format,  in  other  words,  getting  answer  of  equation  and  meaning  of  words.  In  comparison  with  other  calculation 

software’s  that  are  available  for  PCs  and  mobiles,  Archaic  has  the  potential  to  give  the  output  just  by  scanning  the  data 

taken as input in the form of equations or words from a mobile camera rather than making the user input the data manually. 

This Project is being implemented with the following aim in mind 

  Calculator:  The  Calculator  feature  help  users  by  calculating  answers  to  the  equations  involving  mathematical 

calculation  like  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication  and  division  by  just  capturing  the  image  by  mobile  camera 

and getting the solution immediately.  

  Dictionary:  The  Dictionary  feature  is  used  to  provide  users  to  understand  what  they  are  reading  and  hence 

provide with the meaning of the particular word by just clicking a picture of it.

SnaPanda’s API was designed to integrate with any Android application.  Developed by Edulan, it has following features: 

Tactically extract a word from a physical document (newspaper, magazine), obtain the definitions and expressions of that 

English word, and personalize new vocabulary lists. 

  Camera Dictionary OCR 

An application [1] for cell phones with Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile systems. It operates on the basis 

58                                                                                                             Bhakti Karani, Parita Sanghavi, Harshita Bhalakiya & Vinaya Sawant 

of  recorded  text  recognition  and  its  immediate  translation  to  another  language.  Even  though,  this  recorded  language  is 

available in Chinese or English, the translation is extended by couple of other languages. Furthermore, it enables the text 

recording with consequent signing of the translated text or so called ―Video‖ regime during which the cursor appears on 

the  screen.  The  text  below  the  cursor  is  immediately  translated.  However,  the  main  disadvantages  are  the  price  and  the 

necessity of internet connection when used. 

  Babel Reader-LE 

Babel  Reader-LE  [2]  is  a  particular  version  of  Babel  Reader  for  Windows  Mobile  distributed  as  a  freeware.  It 

enables capturing of an image and subsequent storing of this image in a  form of text.  Babel Reader-LE is a very simple 

application. Moreover, it is possible to adjust the captured image before the actual recognition e.g. by background  noise 

removal. As in the case of Nokia solution a clipboard and keyboard option is not possible. 

PROBLEMS OF EXISTING MOBILE OCR SOLUTIONS 

SnaPanda Applicaion crashes frequently and it’s not compatible with respect to the GUI. Camera Dictionary OCR 

is  a  commercial  application  which  is  very  specialized  and  not  free.  Finally,  the  last  mentioned  application  called  Babel 

Reader was only invented for text recognition. The selection of these applications with OCR for cell phones is significantly 

limited and the broader application with OCR, which would  work as an alternative for a virtual keyboard, is still missing. 

These  reasons  lead  us  to  develop  a  new  application  which  is  described  in  this  article.  We  expect  to  develop  a  solution 

which fills a space on current market. 

METHODOLOGY 

Due  to  the  extent  of  this  application,  it  is  planned  to  use  the  existing  OCR  engine.  Following  types  of  engines 

were chosen as the most suitable: 

  Tesseract  OCR  [9]  –  OCR  Engine  developed  by  HP  Company  in  since  1985  until  1995.  Nowadays,  it  is  being 

improved by Google. It is offered in C/C++ language. 

  Ocrad [10] – another open-source OCR engine. One of his main advantages is mainly an automatic transformation 

of  an  input  image.  It  does  not  accomplish  post-processing  on  the  basis  of  language  dictionaries.  It  is  written  in 

C/C++ language. 

  Puma.NET [11] – an engine for implementation in C# projects with .NET framework. 

  ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine [12] – a commercial engine used here just for comparison of results. Not available 

for end users, tested by ABBYY FineReader Online service. 

The ABBYY’s OCR engine was selected due to following reasons: 

Compact  and  undemanding  but  efficient  and  powerful  –  these  are  the  key  features  of  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR 

Engine. With ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine you can make your products more valuable to customers, upgrade and expand 

the functionality and areas of use of your application: 

  Choose the ABBYY Mobile OCR SDK, which is based on the world-renowned FineReader OCR technology, and 

receive high accuracy and quality of recognition combined with sophisticated OCR functionality. 

  Evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR: low  resource  requirements,  optimized  memory 

management, and efficient loading for high performance.

Implementation Steps of ABBY 

In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  text  detection  /  recognition  translation  algorithm  as  represented  in  Figure  1  that 

consists of following steps: 

 

Image Import and Processing. 

  Document Analysis. 

  Optical Character Recognition 

  Result Processing 

Figure 1: ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine Processing 

 

Step 1: Image Import and Processing 

The image is loaded from memory and prepared for OCR. Image binarisation as shown in Figure 2 separates text 

from the background, producing a black-and-white image that is much smaller in size than the  color original. Additional 

skew correction and document orientation detection can be applied.

Automatic Image Skew Correction Function 

When  you  take  photographs  with  a  mobile  device  camera  or  scan  images  with  a  portable  scanner  on-the-run, 

image  skews  occur  fairly  often,  which  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  recognition  quality.  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR  Engine 

allows detection and correction of skews within one degree of precision, which results in a significant improvement of the 

quality and accuracy of mobile OCR.  

Document Orientation Detection Function 

Image pre-processing automatically detects the orientation of a page of text to be recognized

Step 2: Document Analysis 

Document Analysis is a set of algorithms that analyses the image — it detects letters, joins the letters into words, 

then into lines of text, and finally, into paragraphs. Additionally, the reading area is cleaned and noise removed. 

Hyphenation Support 

If the engine encounters a part of a hyphenated word (e.g. Mon-) on one line and the second part (e.g. day) on the 

next line, it will join them into one (Monday) as shown in Figure 3. 

Figure 3: Hyphenation 

 

Preserving Multi-Column Text 

In the previous versions of ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine, text was recognized left to right top to bottom strictly, 

which resulted in placing all the recognized data into one linear massive. ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine 4.0 has a function 

called  «Paragraph  Assembly»,  thanks  to  which  the  new  DA  identifies  text  block  borders  and  recognizes  each  block 

separately,  recognizing  text  left  to  right  and  top  to  bottom  only  within  a  separate  block,  thus  preserving  the  format  of  a 

multi-column text, paragraphs, and text segmenting. 

Preserving Character Fonts 

ABBYY  Mobile  OCR  Engine  identifies  the  font  properties  of  a  source  text,  i.e.  «bold  type»,  «italic»  or 

«underlined». 

Confidence Level Indicator 

This  function shows  the  level  of  certainty  for  recognized  text,  allowing  developers  to  set  flexible  criteria  for 

implementation of proofreading and verification functions. 

Spell Checking 

During text recognition also considerably improves the quality of the output text 

Step 3: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 

Then  the  detected  blocks  on  the  image  are  recognized  using  the  special  language  and  pattern  definitions.  If 

dictionaries are available, then the texts are also compared to improve the overall recognition quality. Recognition results 

are  the  set  of  characters  with  coordinates  united  in  lines.  Each  character  has  the  level  confidence  which  show  how 

recognition engine was sure in final character choice. 

Two Mobile Recognition Modes 

  Fast  mode  of  express  recognition  –  it  is  most  convenient  when  the  image  is  of  good  quality  and  allows  cutting 

down the time required for its recognition and processing. 

  Full mode for accurate recognition – it is best for low-quality images, when more time is required to achieve the 

optimal result.

KEYWORDS: ABBYY’s Engine, Android OS, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 

INTRODUCTION 

In today's  world of automation, time is equivalent to  money. Doing the  work on the  go is the  need of the  hour. 

The major problem these days arises in the organization is, for performing even the small task the user has to input the data 

manually  into  the  corresponding  software  on  the  computer.  This  becomes  very  time  consuming  and  tedious  task  for  the 

user. Results for strategic decisions are required every now and then, but, on the other hand, it takes a long time for the user 

to obtain the results. Archaic aims on solving all the above problems on the go by just using their mobile phones.  

The project aims at using scanning and comparing techniques intended to identify printed text and equations into a 

digital  format,  in  other  words,  getting  answer  of  equation  and  meaning  of  words.  In  comparison  with  other  calculation 

software’s  that  are  available  for  PCs  and  mobiles,  Archaic  has  the  potential  to  give  the  output  just  by  scanning  the  data 

taken as input in the form of equations or words from a mobile camera rather than making the user input the data manually. 

This Project is being implemented with the following aim in mind 

  Calculator:  The  Calculator  feature  help  users  by  calculating  answers  to  the  equations  involving  mathematical 

calculation  like  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication  and  division  by  just  capturing  the  image  by  mobile  camera 

and getting the solution immediately.  

  Dictionary:  The  Dictionary  feature  is  used  to  provide  users  to  understand  what  they  are  reading  and  hence 

provide with the meaning of the particular word by just clicking a picture of it. 

EXISTING MOBILE APPLICATONS BASED ON OCR 

  SnaPanda 

SnaPanda is an entertaining and educational  Smartphone application for those  who seek to enrich their English. 

SnaPanda’s API was designed to integrate with any Android application.  Developed by Edulan, it has following features: 

Tactically extract a word from a physical document (newspaper, magazine), obtain the definitions and expressions of that 

English word, and personalize new vocabulary lists. 

  Camera Dictionary OCR 

An application [1] for cell phones with Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile systems. It operates on the basis 

58                                                                                                             Bhakti Karani, Parita Sanghavi, Harshita Bhalakiya & Vinaya Sawant 

of  recorded  text  recognition  and  its  immediate  translation  to  another  language.  Even  though,  this  recorded  language  is 

available in Chinese or English, the translation is extended by couple of other languages. Furthermore, it enables the text 

recording with consequent signing of the translated text or so called ―Video‖ regime during which the cursor appears on 

the  screen.  The  text  below  the  cursor  is  immediately  translated.  However,  the  main  disadvantages  are  the  price  and  the 

necessity of internet connection when used. 

  Babel Reader-LE 

Babel  Reader-LE  [2]  is  a  particular  version  of  Babel  Reader  for  Windows  Mobile  distributed  as  a  freeware.  It 

enables capturing of an image and subsequent storing of this image in a  form of text.  Babel Reader-LE is a very simple 

application. Moreover, it is possible to adjust the captured image before the actual recognition e.g. by background  noise 

removal. As in the case of Nokia solution a clipboard and keyboard option is not possible. 

PROBLEMS OF EXISTING MOBILE OCR SOLUTIONS 

SnaPanda Applicaion crashes frequently and it’s not compatible with respect to the GUI. Camera Dictionary OCR 

is  a  commercial  application  which  is  very  specialized  and  not  free.  Finally,  the  last  mentioned  application  called  Babel 

Reader was only invented for text recognition. The selection of these applications with OCR for cell phones is significantly 

limited and the broader application with OCR, which would  work as an alternative for a virtual keyboard, is still missing. 

These  reasons  lead  us  to  develop  a  new  application  which  is  described  in  this  article.  We  expect  to  develop  a  solution 

which fills a space on current market. 

METHODOLOGY 

Due  to  the  extent  of  this  application,  it  is  planned  to  use  the  existing  OCR  engine.  Following  types  of  engines 

were chosen as the most suitable: 

  Tesseract  OCR  [9]  –  OCR  Engine  developed  by  HP  Company  in  since  1985  until  1995.  Nowadays,  it  is  being 

improved by Google. It is offered in C/C++ language. 

  Ocrad [10] – another open-source OCR engine. One of his main advantages is mainly an automatic transformation 

of  an  input  image.  It  does  not  accomplish  post-processing  on  the  basis  of  language  dictionaries.  It  is  written  in 

C/C++ language. 

  Puma.NET [11] – an engine for implementation in C# projects with .NET framework. 

  ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine [12] – a commercial engine used here just for comparison of results. Not available 

for end users, tested by ABBYY FineReader Online service. 

The ABBYY’s OCR engine was selected due to following reasons: 

Compact  and  undemanding  but  efficient  and  powerful  –  these  are  the  key  features  of  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR 

Engine. With ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine you can make your products more valuable to customers, upgrade and expand 

the functionality and areas of use of your application: 

  Choose the ABBYY Mobile OCR SDK, which is based on the world-renowned FineReader OCR technology, and 

receive high accuracy and quality of recognition combined with sophisticated OCR functionality. 

  Evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR: low  resource  requirements,  optimized  memory 

management, and efficient loading for high performance.

  Widen  your  markets  with  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR  Engine’s multiple  OS  support:  Android,  iOS  (iPhone), 

Mac, Windows. 

Implementation Steps of ABBY 

In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  text  detection  /  recognition  translation  algorithm  as  represented  in  Figure  1  that 

consists of following steps: 

 

Image Import and Processing. 

  Document Analysis. 

  Optical Character Recognition 

  Result Processing 

Figure 1: ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine Processing 

 

Step 1: Image Import and Processing 

The image is loaded from memory and prepared for OCR. Image binarisation as shown in Figure 2 separates text 

from the background, producing a black-and-white image that is much smaller in size than the  color original. Additional 

skew correction and document orientation detection can be applied. 

Figure 2: Image Binarisation 

 

Automatic Image Skew Correction Function 

When  you  take  photographs  with  a  mobile  device  camera  or  scan  images  with  a  portable  scanner  on-the-run, 

image  skews  occur  fairly  often,  which  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  recognition  quality.  ABBYY  Mobile  OCR  Engine 

allows detection and correction of skews within one degree of precision, which results in a significant improvement of the 

quality and accuracy of mobile OCR.  

Document Orientation Detection Function 

Image pre-processing automatically detects the orientation of a page of text to be recognized  

60                                                                                                             Bhakti Karani, Parita Sanghavi, Harshita Bhalakiya & Vinaya Sawant 

Step 2: Document Analysis 

Document Analysis is a set of algorithms that analyses the image — it detects letters, joins the letters into words, 

then into lines of text, and finally, into paragraphs. Additionally, the reading area is cleaned and noise removed. 

Hyphenation Support 

If the engine encounters a part of a hyphenated word (e.g. Mon-) on one line and the second part (e.g. day) on the 

next line, it will join them into one (Monday) as shown in Figure 3. 

Figure 3: Hyphenation 

 

Preserving Multi-Column Text 

In the previous versions of ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine, text was recognized left to right top to bottom strictly, 

which resulted in placing all the recognized data into one linear massive. ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine 4.0 has a function 

called  «Paragraph  Assembly»,  thanks  to  which  the  new  DA  identifies  text  block  borders  and  recognizes  each  block 

separately,  recognizing  text  left  to  right  and  top  to  bottom  only  within  a  separate  block,  thus  preserving  the  format  of  a 

multi-column text, paragraphs, and text segmenting. 

Preserving Character Fonts 

ABBYY  Mobile  OCR  Engine  identifies  the  font  properties  of  a  source  text,  i.e.  «bold  type»,  «italic»  or 

«underlined». 

Confidence Level Indicator 

This  function shows  the  level  of  certainty  for  recognized  text,  allowing  developers  to  set  flexible  criteria  for 

implementation of proofreading and verification functions. 

Spell Checking 

During text recognition also considerably improves the quality of the output text 

Step 3: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 

Then  the  detected  blocks  on  the  image  are  recognized  using  the  special  language  and  pattern  definitions.  If 

dictionaries are available, then the texts are also compared to improve the overall recognition quality. Recognition results 

are  the  set  of  characters  with  coordinates  united  in  lines.  Each  character  has  the  level  confidence  which  show  how 

recognition engine was sure in final character choice.

  Fast  mode  of  express  recognition  –  it  is  most  convenient  when  the  image  is  of  good  quality  and  allows  cutting 

down the time required for its recognition and processing. 

  Full mode for accurate recognition – it is best for low-quality images, when more time is required to achieve the 

optimal result.

Step 4: Result Processing 

The recognition results can be processed and exported. The developer of the application has full control over the 

OCR results.

This application can be further extended by integrating various other features to the existing application like:  

  Finding the price of various products by just clicking the picture of it. 

 

 

Identifying the location of the place by clicking the image of its name.  

It can also enhanced by converting handwritten image to text. 

  Calculating complex equations. 

CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  implemented  the  Application  based  on  OCR  Technology  where  user  can  either  perform  normal 

calculation  or  find  meaning  of  a  particular  word.The  existing  application  to  implement  OCR  such  as  OCR  TEST  didn’t 

serve  to  be  helpful  since  the  provided  user  interface  was  not  easy  and  simple  to  use.  The  OCR  TEST  requires  a  large 

amount of RAM. If your device doesn't have enough RAM, the application will quit during OCR. The OCR Test is a very 

useful application, but lack of controlling flash causes poor performance in low light. Also the other available application 

SNAPANDA  crashes  frequently  and  it  does  not  fit  on  many  Android  phones  like  Samsung  s3,  Motorola  atrix  4  etc. 

ARCHAIC  tries  to  overcome  all  the  shortcomings  from  the  existing  applications.  As  it  uses  ABBYY’s  algorithm,  the 

following steps required for OCR such as image processing, text recognition and document analysis is faster and accurate. 

The  GUI  of  the  application  is  user-friendly  and  the  user  wouldn’t  need  any  special  training  to  run  the  application.  The 

calculator provided by the application serves to be very useful to the user since it makes the user’s work simpler by solving 

large tedious equations faster and without errors. The dictionary provided helps the user to find the synonym of the words 

which are difficult. As all this takes place in the user’s Android phone, he can use it anywhere and anytime.
