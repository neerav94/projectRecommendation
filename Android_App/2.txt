INTRODUCTION 

                      Due to increasing population, the metropolitan cities are facing an acute problem of traffic and congestion. 
Due to lack of flexibility of public transportation, people prefer to travel by their own vehicles which results in gigantic 
increase  in  number  of  vehicles.  Due  to  increasing  number  of  vehicles,  problems  of  fuel  combustion,  pollution  are 
increasing at an alarming rate. This will result in extinction of natural resources like petrol, diesel and also harming the 
environment by releasing the contents of carbon dioxide, and other harmful gases in surrounding. To overcome or to find 
a accurate solution a concept of carpooling comes into picture.A carpool is a system in which several people share rides 
to  work,  school  or  other  destinations.  This  system  helps  save  money  by  dividing  fuel  costs  among  several  individuals, 
instead  of  each  person  bearing  the  cost  of  his  own  fuel.  It  also  reduces  environmental  pollution  by  limiting  fuel 
consumption  and  reducing  the  number  of  vehicles  on  the  road  and  subsequent  emissions.  Carpooling  is  an  easy  and 
effective  way to reduce  your  environmental impact and save cash. By finding a co-worker or neighbour (or several) to 
share the drive with, you will also be reducing traffic congestion for yourself and others. Bonus: reducing the number of 
miles put on  your car  will increase its lifetime. The  more  you carpool, the  more  your  wallet, car, and the environment 
will  thank  you.  To  overcome  this  problem  an  application  was  developed  on  smartphone  operating  on  iOS  operating 
system but this application was not flexible for users having android operating system.So we developed an application on 
android  which is easily available to users as everyone  has  a smartphone  with android operating  system.Taking an idea 
from  previous  application  we  developed  an  application  for  android  devices  and  which  can  track  both  passenger  and 
driver.The  paper  is  organized  in  different  section  like,Section  II  containing  the  review  of  previous  work  and  their 
limitation,Section III contains the architecture of proposed system and how the system will work,Section IV will contain 
the result and analysis and finally the Section V will contain the conclusion and future works.

A.  Need for Carpooling Application:- 
                There  are  many  websites  for  carpooling  but  these  websites  fail  during  the  actual  working[2].Carpooling 
websites  are  not  flexible  and    does  not  give  an  assurance  during  the  payment  matters.The  Carpooling  application  for 
apple phone was also not that much flexible because of driver can keep tracking the passenger and the passenger does not 
know  the  status  of  driver  and  also  there  were  issues  related  to  security.The  apple  application  “Carticipate”[3]  is  not 
flexible  in  countries  like  India,where  people  have  operating  system  like  android,  symbian.So  we  developed  an 
application on android as it is more user-friendly and easily available.

  User/Passenger cannot track the driver[3]. 
  Cannot be used on other operating systems[3]. 
 
  Security issues. 

 More Expensive. 

Carticipate  tends  to  struggle  from  lack  of  users.Only  10.8%  of  all  commuters  carpool  due  reasons  such  as  finding 
people willing to carpool with them.There are different websites which help in carpooling but fails at some level while 
dealing with issues like payment, security and real-time tracking. 
 
C.  Proposed solution to Carpool using Android:- 
          To overcome the drawbacks of previous system or applications, we proposed a application for android users. In our 
system  we are  mainly dealing  with security issues  which resulted in  failure of previous systems. To deal  with security 
issues we are using a comment and rating system. The passenger and driver are given a provision to rate and comment 
each  other.  This  details  will  be  helpful  for  people  who  are  travelling  with  same  passenger  and  driver.  Our  system  will 
contain  a  driver  ,passenger  module,  modules  for  comment  and  rating  and  for  google  maps.The  system  will  be 
communicating with xampp server which is having Mysql and php as cross platform. The system will work in a two-way 
communication between driver and passenger and thus creating a flexible environment. The details which are given by 
passenger  will  be  displayed  on  drivers  phone  and  vice-versa.  The  passengers  cane  booked  the  seats  by  reviewing  the 
history  and  then  taking  final  decision  of  whether  to  carpool  or  not.  The  reason  behind  choosing  Android  is  it  is  more 
popular among users and is less expensive. The applications can be easily downloaded from the Google Play and can be 
used whenever want. Inspired by the use of android applications in different sectors, we tried to develop an application 
which will help in conserving environment and also in reducing traffic congestion problems. The main aim or goal of our 
system is to provide a application  which  will  help in serving  the customer requirements and also because of  following 
points listed below: 

  Enhanced security for women passenger. 
  High reliability due to real-time tracking. 
  Enhanced payment features. 
  Reviewing the history. 
  Both driver and passenger can stay in touch with each-other. 

 

A.  System Architecture:- 
    The System architecture shown in fig.1 show how the system actually works o interacts.The main modules are the 

passenger and driver.The application will be installed on both the devices and they will interact with each other. 

III. The Carpool Android System 

 
The Carpool application will contain the most important things and they are listed below:- 

Fig 1.System Architecture with internet access. 

 The application will be deployed on the driver and passenger android phone. 
 The database which will allot id to the driver and passenger. 
 The central database which will manage other database and control the activities. 
 The ratings and comments history will be displayed on mobile phones.

         In this we are giving a detailed description of how exactly the user and passengers will interact and also some use-
case  diagram  and  also  class  diagram.  The  passenger  or  the  driver  has  to  register  themselves  if  they  are  using  the 
application for first time. If they are already registered they have to login using their phone number and password. After 
login, they have to select whether they are driver or user. If  he/she is a driver then the details of carpool will be filled and 
it  will be stored in database. If he/she is a passenger then  the details  will be displayed  on their respective phones. The 
passenger will fill the details and seats will be booked. 

       After successful carpool, the driver as well as passenger will rate and comment and this will be stored in database. 

The google maps will be displayed for the source and destination given by driver.

Abstract— As a rapid increase in urbanization, there are huge problems face in travelling. People are migrating from 
on city to other in search of jobs. This result in increasing population and thus resulting in insufficient transportation 
facilities.  Due  to  this  people  prefer  to  travel  by  their  own  vehicle  than  using  public  transportation.  This  leads  to 
problems  like  increase  in  number  of  vehicles,  traffic,  fuel  combustion,  heavy  cost  on  resources,  parking  problems. 
Using  two  different  vehicles  leads  to  an  increase  in  personal  expenses,  stress.  To  overcome  this  hurdle,  a  quite 
different but realistic solution called “CarPooling” can be used. Carpooling is concept in which  people travelling to 
same destination can share car without  using different cars. Carpooling can also be called ride-sharing. Carpooling 
will help in reducing the problems of traffic jams, fuel combustion, also help in controlling pollution and resulting in 
green  environment.This  application  will  successfully  overcome  the  drawbacks  of  previous  application  which  can  be 
accessed only by the driver and not the passenger which resulted in inflexibility and also is less expensive and anyone 
can afford it on their Smartphone and is quite more user-friendly.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

                      Due to increasing population, the metropolitan cities are facing an acute problem of traffic and congestion. 
Due to lack of flexibility of public transportation, people prefer to travel by their own vehicles which results in gigantic 
increase  in  number  of  vehicles.  Due  to  increasing  number  of  vehicles,  problems  of  fuel  combustion,  pollution  are 
increasing at an alarming rate. This will result in extinction of natural resources like petrol, diesel and also harming the 
environment by releasing the contents of carbon dioxide, and other harmful gases in surrounding. To overcome or to find 
a accurate solution a concept of carpooling comes into picture.A carpool is a system in which several people share rides 
to  work,  school  or  other  destinations.  This  system  helps  save  money  by  dividing  fuel  costs  among  several  individuals, 
instead  of  each  person  bearing  the  cost  of  his  own  fuel.  It  also  reduces  environmental  pollution  by  limiting  fuel 
consumption  and  reducing  the  number  of  vehicles  on  the  road  and  subsequent  emissions.  Carpooling  is  an  easy  and 
effective  way to reduce  your  environmental impact and save cash. By finding a co-worker or neighbour (or several) to 
share the drive with, you will also be reducing traffic congestion for yourself and others. Bonus: reducing the number of 
miles put on  your car  will increase its lifetime. The  more  you carpool, the  more  your  wallet, car, and the environment 
will  thank  you.  To  overcome  this  problem  an  application  was  developed  on  smartphone  operating  on  iOS  operating 
system but this application was not flexible for users having android operating system.So we developed an application on 
android  which is easily available to users as everyone  has  a smartphone  with android operating  system.Taking an idea 
from  previous  application  we  developed  an  application  for  android  devices  and  which  can  track  both  passenger  and 
driver.The  paper  is  organized  in  different  section  like,Section  II  containing  the  review  of  previous  work  and  their 
limitation,Section III contains the architecture of proposed system and how the system will work,Section IV will contain 
the result and analysis and finally the Section V will contain the conclusion and future works.

Related Work 

A.  Need for Carpooling Application:- 
                There  are  many  websites  for  carpooling  but  these  websites  fail  during  the  actual  working[2].Carpooling 
websites  are  not  flexible  and    does  not  give  an  assurance  during  the  payment  matters.The  Carpooling  application  for 
apple phone was also not that much flexible because of driver can keep tracking the passenger and the passenger does not 
know  the  status  of  driver  and  also  there  were  issues  related  to  security.The  apple  application  “Carticipate”[3]  is  not 
flexible  in  countries  like  India,where  people  have  operating  system  like  android,  symbian.So  we  developed  an 
application on android as it is more user-friendly and easily available. 

 

B.  Limitations of Previous Systems:- 
        The  Carticipate  carpool  application  is  not  susceptible  because  it  was  not  able  to  fulfil  the  requirement  which  are 
listed below:-

  User/Passenger cannot track the driver[3]. 
  Cannot be used on other operating systems[3]. 
 
  Security issues. 

 More Expensive. 

Carticipate  tends  to  struggle  from  lack  of  users.Only  10.8%  of  all  commuters  carpool  due  reasons  such  as  finding 
people willing to carpool with them.There are different websites which help in carpooling but fails at some level while 
dealing with issues like payment, security and real-time tracking. 
 
C.  Proposed solution to Carpool using Android:- 
          To overcome the drawbacks of previous system or applications, we proposed a application for android users. In our 
system  we are  mainly dealing  with security issues  which resulted in  failure of previous systems. To deal  with security 
issues we are using a comment and rating system. The passenger and driver are given a provision to rate and comment 
each  other.  This  details  will  be  helpful  for  people  who  are  travelling  with  same  passenger  and  driver.  Our  system  will 
contain  a  driver  ,passenger  module,  modules  for  comment  and  rating  and  for  google  maps.The  system  will  be 
communicating with xampp server which is having Mysql and php as cross platform. The system will work in a two-way 
communication between driver and passenger and thus creating a flexible environment. The details which are given by 
passenger  will  be  displayed  on  drivers  phone  and  vice-versa.  The  passengers  cane  booked  the  seats  by  reviewing  the 
history  and  then  taking  final  decision  of  whether  to  carpool  or  not.  The  reason  behind  choosing  Android  is  it  is  more 
popular among users and is less expensive. The applications can be easily downloaded from the Google Play and can be 
used whenever want. Inspired by the use of android applications in different sectors, we tried to develop an application 
which will help in conserving environment and also in reducing traffic congestion problems. The main aim or goal of our 
system is to provide a application  which  will  help in serving  the customer requirements and also because of  following 
points listed below: 

  Enhanced security for women passenger. 
  High reliability due to real-time tracking. 
  Enhanced payment features. 
  Reviewing the history. 
  Both driver and passenger can stay in touch with each-other. 

 

A.  System Architecture:- 
    The System architecture shown in fig.1 show how the system actually works o interacts.The main modules are the 

passenger and driver.The application will be installed on both the devices and they will interact with each other. 

III. The Carpool Android System 

 
The Carpool application will contain the most important things and they are listed below:- 

Fig 1.System Architecture with internet access. 

 The application will be deployed on the driver and passenger android phone. 
 The database which will allot id to the driver and passenger. 
 The central database which will manage other database and control the activities. 
 The ratings and comments history will be displayed on mobile phones.
