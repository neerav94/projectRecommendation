2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

In  that  period,  sales  through  mobile  increased  rapidly.  Revenue  through  mobile  phone 
increased  by  26.6%  yearly  from  2009  to  2012,  which  was  the  time  when  the  number  of 
mobile  phone  users  was  increasing  by  14.2%  annually.  In  particular,  smartphone  sales 
reached the annual increase rate of 114% [3].  

These  two  rapidly  growing  businesses,  films  and  mobile  phones,  can  be  combined  to 
present a new sales opportunity for the film industry. This can be accomplished by providing 
applications  to  search  and  buy  tickets  to  movies  via  a  mobile  phone.  This  is  already 
widespread in Korea, but not in China yet [4].  

This case study is to introduce a mobile movie tracking application and internal system 
developed  by  a  theater  company  which  operates  17  theaters  in  China.  Through  this  case

identified.  Further,  reservation  information  by  individual  and  segment  markets  can  be 
collected  through  this  reservation  system  and  put  into  a  database.  Then,  through  mixture 
modeling, a list of recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to 
reserve  is  shown  on  the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc 
segmentation  has  taken  center  stage,  but  in  the  film  industry,  mixture  modeling,  which  is 
rarely used in business, is being used [5]. 
 
2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.  

Copyright ⓒ 2013 SERSC  

 

307 

International Journal of  Smart Home 
Vol.7, No.5 (2013) 
 
 

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In 
particular,  for  users  who  purchased  a  VIP  card,  which  is  widely  used  in  the  movie 
industry in China, demographic variables can also be included on the DB. 

If a moviegoer has n number of movie watching records, the probability (pns) of one 
record i showing up on a specific segmented market s shows up as the likelihood of the 
movie watching record yn showing up under (θs), the condition (θ) of the variables of 
the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

Abstract 

This case study is to introduce a Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) and its internal 
system developed by a theater company which operates 17 theaters in China. Through this 
case  study,  from  a  business  perspective,  components  within  the  MMTS  can  be  identified. 
Further, reservation information by individual and segment level can be collected through the 
MMTS and put into a database. Then, through mixture modeling, a list, time, and theater of 
recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to reserve is shown on 
the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc  segmentation  such  as 
mixture modeling has been reported frequently, but in the film industry, mixture modeling is 
rarely  used  in  practice.  Especially,  the  output  example  in  fuzzy  clustering  algorithm  by 
mixture  modeling  in  MMTS  shows  the  probability  of  when,  where,  and  which  movie  a 
potential moviegoer choosing movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a 
movie.  The  system  first  suggests  the  theater  where  the  individual  would  visit.  The  visit 
probability is calculated by the mixture model using the previous visit database [11]. 

However, in case of newcomer to application, the proposed system is designed to suggest 
the theaters by using location-based information. The system uses Google Maps to provide 
such geographical information.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

In  that  period,  sales  through  mobile  increased  rapidly.  Revenue  through  mobile  phone 
increased  by  26.6%  yearly  from  2009  to  2012,  which  was  the  time  when  the  number  of 
mobile  phone  users  was  increasing  by  14.2%  annually.  In  particular,  smartphone  sales 
reached the annual increase rate of 114% [3].  

These  two  rapidly  growing  businesses,  films  and  mobile  phones,  can  be  combined  to 
present a new sales opportunity for the film industry. This can be accomplished by providing 
applications  to  search  and  buy  tickets  to  movies  via  a  mobile  phone.  This  is  already 
widespread in Korea, but not in China yet [4].  

This case study is to introduce a mobile movie tracking application and internal system 
developed  by  a  theater  company  which  operates  17  theaters  in  China.  Through  this  case 
study, from a business perspective, components within the movie reservation system can be

identified.  Further,  reservation  information  by  individual  and  segment  markets  can  be 
collected  through  this  reservation  system  and  put  into  a  database.  Then,  through  mixture 
modeling, a list of recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to 
reserve  is  shown  on  the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc 
segmentation  has  taken  center  stage,  but  in  the  film  industry,  mixture  modeling,  which  is 
rarely used in business, is being used [5]. 
 
2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.  

Copyright ⓒ 2013 SERSC  

 

307 

International Journal of  Smart Home 
Vol.7, No.5 (2013) 
 
 

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In 
particular,  for  users  who  purchased  a  VIP  card,  which  is  widely  used  in  the  movie 
industry in China, demographic variables can also be included on the DB. 

If a moviegoer has n number of movie watching records, the probability (pns) of one 
record i showing up on a specific segmented market s shows up as the likelihood of the 
movie watching record yn showing up under (θs), the condition (θ) of the variables of 
the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

Figure 3. Review Posting System for User 

2.3. Theater Selection System 

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a 
movie.  The  system  first  suggests  the  theater  where  the  individual  would  visit.  The  visit 
probability is calculated by the mixture model using the previous visit database [11]. 

However, in case of newcomer to application, the proposed system is designed to suggest 
the theaters by using location-based information. The system uses Google Maps to provide 
such geographical information.

2.4. Date/time Selection System 

The proposed system gathers detailed information used for reservation at a specific movie 
theater. The standard process involves the selection of the date and time first and then that of 
the number of tickets and the seats. A scroll bar is placed to increase the interest of the users 
when  choosing  date,  time,  and  number  of  people.  Of  course,  the  mixture  model  makes  it 
possible  to  calculate  the  probability  of  the  preferred  day  and  time  of  the  existing  users. 
Therefore,  as  soon  as  the  user  touches  a  button  to  select  the  preferred  date  and  time  at  a 
specific theater, the screen can provide the day and time often selected previously by the user.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 6. Date and Time Selection 

In case of the Chinese theater company, the moviegoers are shown to have the day-of-the 
week effect. In other words, theaters attract a higher number of visitors on specific days than 
on  the  other  days.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  specific  clients  preferring  specific  days  is 
calculated by tracking the existing moviegoers, and this can be used as illustrated in Figure 6.

Abstract 

This case study is to introduce a Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) and its internal 
system developed by a theater company which operates 17 theaters in China. Through this 
case  study,  from  a  business  perspective,  components  within  the  MMTS  can  be  identified. 
Further, reservation information by individual and segment level can be collected through the 
MMTS and put into a database. Then, through mixture modeling, a list, time, and theater of 
recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to reserve is shown on 
the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc  segmentation  such  as 
mixture modeling has been reported frequently, but in the film industry, mixture modeling is 
rarely  used  in  practice.  Especially,  the  output  example  in  fuzzy  clustering  algorithm  by 
mixture  modeling  in  MMTS  shows  the  probability  of  when,  where,  and  which  movie  a 
potential moviegoer choosing movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In

the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

2.3. Theater Selection System 

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a 
movie.  The  system  first  suggests  the  theater  where  the  individual  would  visit.  The  visit 
probability is calculated by the mixture model using the previous visit database [11]. 

However, in case of newcomer to application, the proposed system is designed to suggest 
the theaters by using location-based information. The system uses Google Maps to provide 
such geographical information.

2.4. Date/time Selection System 

The proposed system gathers detailed information used for reservation at a specific movie 
theater. The standard process involves the selection of the date and time first and then that of 
the number of tickets and the seats. A scroll bar is placed to increase the interest of the users 
when  choosing  date,  time,  and  number  of  people.  Of  course,  the  mixture  model  makes  it 
possible  to  calculate  the  probability  of  the  preferred  day  and  time  of  the  existing  users. 
Therefore,  as  soon  as  the  user  touches  a  button  to  select  the  preferred  date  and  time  at  a 
specific theater, the screen can provide the day and time often selected previously by the user.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 6. Date and Time Selection 

In case of the Chinese theater company, the moviegoers are shown to have the day-of-the 
week effect. In other words, theaters attract a higher number of visitors on specific days than 
on  the  other  days.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  specific  clients  preferring  specific  days  is 
calculated by tracking the existing moviegoers, and this can be used as illustrated in Figure 6.

2.5. Payment and Reservation Confirmation System 

These two systems implement general and commercialized services. The payment system 
must  include  the  selection  of  a  payment  method  and  link  the  applicable  discount  system. 
Depending on the payment method, a sub-payment system must be additionally established. 
For example, if a user pays with a credit card, a system called “Alipay” is used in China. 
Figure 8 shows the payment process. 

The  reservation  confirmation  system  lets  moviegoers  check  all  their  previously  selected 
contents on the app. That is, it can display a user’s reservation history, cancelation history, 
point information, and setting options.  

This reservation information is not only provided on the app provided by MMTS but also 
on the user’s mobile phone as an image. This image is automatically sent as the user finishes 
the reservation process.

Abstract 

This case study is to introduce a Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) and its internal 
system developed by a theater company which operates 17 theaters in China. Through this 
case  study,  from  a  business  perspective,  components  within  the  MMTS  can  be  identified. 
Further, reservation information by individual and segment level can be collected through the 
MMTS and put into a database. Then, through mixture modeling, a list, time, and theater of 
recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to reserve is shown on 
the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc  segmentation  such  as 
mixture modeling has been reported frequently, but in the film industry, mixture modeling is 
rarely  used  in  practice.  Especially,  the  output  example  in  fuzzy  clustering  algorithm  by 
mixture  modeling  in  MMTS  shows  the  probability  of  when,  where,  and  which  movie  a 
potential moviegoer choosing movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

In  that  period,  sales  through  mobile  increased  rapidly.  Revenue  through  mobile  phone 
increased  by  26.6%  yearly  from  2009  to  2012,  which  was  the  time  when  the  number  of 
mobile  phone  users  was  increasing  by  14.2%  annually.  In  particular,  smartphone  sales 
reached the annual increase rate of 114% [3].  

These  two  rapidly  growing  businesses,  films  and  mobile  phones,  can  be  combined  to 
present a new sales opportunity for the film industry. This can be accomplished by providing 
applications  to  search  and  buy  tickets  to  movies  via  a  mobile  phone.  This  is  already 
widespread in Korea, but not in China yet [4].  

This case study is to introduce a mobile movie tracking application and internal system 
developed  by  a  theater  company  which  operates  17  theaters  in  China.  Through  this  case 
study, from a business perspective, components within the movie reservation system can be

identified.  Further,  reservation  information  by  individual  and  segment  markets  can  be 
collected  through  this  reservation  system  and  put  into  a  database.  Then,  through  mixture 
modeling, a list of recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to 
reserve  is  shown  on  the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc 
segmentation  has  taken  center  stage,  but  in  the  film  industry,  mixture  modeling,  which  is 
rarely used in business, is being used [5]. 
 
2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.  

Copyright ⓒ 2013 SERSC  

 

307 

International Journal of  Smart Home 
Vol.7, No.5 (2013) 
 
 

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In 
particular,  for  users  who  purchased  a  VIP  card,  which  is  widely  used  in  the  movie 
industry in China, demographic variables can also be included on the DB. 

If a moviegoer has n number of movie watching records, the probability (pns) of one 
record i showing up on a specific segmented market s shows up as the likelihood of the 
movie watching record yn showing up under (θs), the condition (θ) of the variables of 
the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a

In case of the Chinese theater company, the moviegoers are shown to have the day-of-the 
week effect. In other words, theaters attract a higher number of visitors on specific days than 
on  the  other  days.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  specific  clients  preferring  specific  days  is 
calculated by tracking the existing moviegoers, and this can be used as illustrated in Figure 6.

The  reservation  confirmation  system  lets  moviegoers  check  all  their  previously  selected 
contents on the app. That is, it can display a user’s reservation history, cancelation history,

This reservation information is not only provided on the app provided by MMTS but also

4. Prospects for MMTS 

Among the MMTSs introduced above, a location-based theater recommendation service is 
what ordinary people are familiar with. On the other hand, workers in the film industry or 
academia  are  not  familiar  with  a  customized  movie  information  service,  theater  location 
providing  service,  and  preferred  day  and  time  providing  service  provided  by  the  mixture 
model  for  the  existing  moviegoers.  However,  users  can  see  their  preferred  movie  genres, 
time, place, and day from the very first page of the screen without having to go through other 
uninteresting  movie  genres,  time  frames,  or  places.  In  order  to  make  this  possible,  the 
collection of and the construction of a DB of the movie watching information of the existing 
users are essential. Therefore, the future MMTS development direction depends on how much 
information of how many users can be accumulated on the DB. 

The second development direction is strengthening the earning power. The existing system 
only has a simple payment function. However, the future payment system must calculate the 
moviegoers’  frequency  of  watching  movies  as  well  as  the  price  elasticity  in  advance,  and 
provide  the  movie  price  by  day/time/genre/number  of  people  accompanying  the  user.  For 
example, some of the moviegoers of this theater frequently watched movies on Tuesdays and 
the  price  was  inelastic,  and  those  that  watched  movies  on  weekends  had  to  pay  an  elastic 
price. Therefore, increasing the movie ticket price on Tuesdays will not reduce the number of 
moviegoers.

system developed by a theater company which operates 17 theaters in China. Through this 
case  study,  from  a  business  perspective,  components  within  the  MMTS  can  be  identified. 
Further, reservation information by individual and segment level can be collected through the 
MMTS and put into a database. Then, through mixture modeling, a list, time, and theater of 
recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to reserve is shown on 
the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc  segmentation  such  as 
mixture modeling has been reported frequently, but in the film industry, mixture modeling is 
rarely  used  in  practice.  Especially,  the  output  example  in  fuzzy  clustering  algorithm  by 
mixture  modeling  in  MMTS  shows  the  probability  of  when,  where,  and  which  movie  a 
potential moviegoer choosing movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

In  that  period,  sales  through  mobile  increased  rapidly.  Revenue  through  mobile  phone 
increased  by  26.6%  yearly  from  2009  to  2012,  which  was  the  time  when  the  number  of 
mobile  phone  users  was  increasing  by  14.2%  annually.  In  particular,  smartphone  sales 
reached the annual increase rate of 114% [3].  

These  two  rapidly  growing  businesses,  films  and  mobile  phones,  can  be  combined  to 
present a new sales opportunity for the film industry. This can be accomplished by providing 
applications  to  search  and  buy  tickets  to  movies  via  a  mobile  phone.  This  is  already 
widespread in Korea, but not in China yet [4].  

This case study is to introduce a mobile movie tracking application and internal system 
developed  by  a  theater  company  which  operates  17  theaters  in  China.  Through  this  case 
study, from a business perspective, components within the movie reservation system can be

identified.  Further,  reservation  information  by  individual  and  segment  markets  can  be 
collected  through  this  reservation  system  and  put  into  a  database.  Then,  through  mixture 
modeling, a list of recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to 
reserve  is  shown  on  the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc 
segmentation  has  taken  center  stage,  but  in  the  film  industry,  mixture  modeling,  which  is 
rarely used in business, is being used [5]. 
 
2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.  

Copyright ⓒ 2013 SERSC  

 

307 

International Journal of  Smart Home 
Vol.7, No.5 (2013) 
 
 

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In 
particular,  for  users  who  purchased  a  VIP  card,  which  is  widely  used  in  the  movie 
industry in China, demographic variables can also be included on the DB. 

If a moviegoer has n number of movie watching records, the probability (pns) of one 
record i showing up on a specific segmented market s shows up as the likelihood of the 
movie watching record yn showing up under (θs), the condition (θ) of the variables of 
the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

2.3. Theater Selection System 

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a 
movie.  The  system  first  suggests  the  theater  where  the  individual  would  visit.  The  visit 
probability is calculated by the mixture model using the previous visit database [11]. 

However, in case of newcomer to application, the proposed system is designed to suggest 
the theaters by using location-based information. The system uses Google Maps to provide 
such geographical information.

2.4. Date/time Selection System 

The proposed system gathers detailed information used for reservation at a specific movie 
theater. The standard process involves the selection of the date and time first and then that of 
the number of tickets and the seats. A scroll bar is placed to increase the interest of the users 
when  choosing  date,  time,  and  number  of  people.  Of  course,  the  mixture  model  makes  it 
possible  to  calculate  the  probability  of  the  preferred  day  and  time  of  the  existing  users. 
Therefore,  as  soon  as  the  user  touches  a  button  to  select  the  preferred  date  and  time  at  a 
specific theater, the screen can provide the day and time often selected previously by the user.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 6. Date and Time Selection 

In case of the Chinese theater company, the moviegoers are shown to have the day-of-the 
week effect. In other words, theaters attract a higher number of visitors on specific days than 
on  the  other  days.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  specific  clients  preferring  specific  days  is 
calculated by tracking the existing moviegoers, and this can be used as illustrated in Figure 6.

2.5. Payment and Reservation Confirmation System 

These two systems implement general and commercialized services. The payment system 
must  include  the  selection  of  a  payment  method  and  link  the  applicable  discount  system. 
Depending on the payment method, a sub-payment system must be additionally established. 
For example, if a user pays with a credit card, a system called “Alipay” is used in China. 
Figure 8 shows the payment process. 

The  reservation  confirmation  system  lets  moviegoers  check  all  their  previously  selected 
contents on the app. That is, it can display a user’s reservation history, cancelation history, 
point information, and setting options.  

This reservation information is not only provided on the app provided by MMTS but also 
on the user’s mobile phone as an image. This image is automatically sent as the user finishes 
the reservation process.

4. Prospects for MMTS 

Among the MMTSs introduced above, a location-based theater recommendation service is 
what ordinary people are familiar with. On the other hand, workers in the film industry or 
academia  are  not  familiar  with  a  customized  movie  information  service,  theater  location 
providing  service,  and  preferred  day  and  time  providing  service  provided  by  the  mixture 
model  for  the  existing  moviegoers.  However,  users  can  see  their  preferred  movie  genres, 
time, place, and day from the very first page of the screen without having to go through other 
uninteresting  movie  genres,  time  frames,  or  places.  In  order  to  make  this  possible,  the 
collection of and the construction of a DB of the movie watching information of the existing 
users are essential. Therefore, the future MMTS development direction depends on how much 
information of how many users can be accumulated on the DB. 

The second development direction is strengthening the earning power. The existing system 
only has a simple payment function. However, the future payment system must calculate the 
moviegoers’  frequency  of  watching  movies  as  well  as  the  price  elasticity  in  advance,  and 
provide  the  movie  price  by  day/time/genre/number  of  people  accompanying  the  user.  For 
example, some of the moviegoers of this theater frequently watched movies on Tuesdays and 
the  price  was  inelastic,  and  those  that  watched  movies  on  weekends  had  to  pay  an  elastic 
price. Therefore, increasing the movie ticket price on Tuesdays will not reduce the number of 
moviegoers.

Abstract 

This case study is to introduce a Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) and its internal 
system developed by a theater company which operates 17 theaters in China. Through this 
case  study,  from  a  business  perspective,  components  within  the  MMTS  can  be  identified. 
Further, reservation information by individual and segment level can be collected through the 
MMTS and put into a database. Then, through mixture modeling, a list, time, and theater of 
recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to reserve is shown on 
the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc  segmentation  such  as 
mixture modeling has been reported frequently, but in the film industry, mixture modeling is 
rarely  used  in  practice.  Especially,  the  output  example  in  fuzzy  clustering  algorithm  by 
mixture  modeling  in  MMTS  shows  the  probability  of  when,  where,  and  which  movie  a 
potential moviegoer choosing movies.

1. Introduction 

China  is  the  newest  rising  film  market.  Movie  revenue  in  the  North  American  region 
including the U.S. and Canada ranked the highest with $10.8 billion, and China stepped up to 
the second  place  with  $2.7  billion. Japan  has  always  maintained  its  position in  the  second 
place next to the U.S. and Canada, but China overtook this position for the first time last year. 
The global movie industry revenue in 2012 was $34.7 billion, increased by 6% from 2011. 
Movie revenue in the U.S. and Canada has also increased by 6%. However, within the same 
period, the film industry in China has increased by 36%, the fastest growing pace in the world 
[1].  

As shown in Table 1, the film sales in China increased by 40% yearly between 2009 and 
2012, while the number of moviegoers increased by 31% yearly. This number shows a steady 
increase  in  the  price  of  movie  tickets  during  these  years.  In  other  words,  despite  the 
increasing price that a moviegoer must pay, the number of moviegoers has increased.

The sales increase of film industry has stimulated film suppliers. The number of theaters 
playing  movies  increased  by  30%  annually  between  2009  and  2012.  And  the  number  of 
screens increased by 41%. It shows that theaters have become bigger. Besides, the number of 
companies in film market increased by 8% in the same period [2].

In  that  period,  sales  through  mobile  increased  rapidly.  Revenue  through  mobile  phone 
increased  by  26.6%  yearly  from  2009  to  2012,  which  was  the  time  when  the  number  of 
mobile  phone  users  was  increasing  by  14.2%  annually.  In  particular,  smartphone  sales 
reached the annual increase rate of 114% [3].  

These  two  rapidly  growing  businesses,  films  and  mobile  phones,  can  be  combined  to 
present a new sales opportunity for the film industry. This can be accomplished by providing 
applications  to  search  and  buy  tickets  to  movies  via  a  mobile  phone.  This  is  already 
widespread in Korea, but not in China yet [4].  

This case study is to introduce a mobile movie tracking application and internal system 
developed  by  a  theater  company  which  operates  17  theaters  in  China.  Through  this  case 
study, from a business perspective, components within the movie reservation system can be

identified.  Further,  reservation  information  by  individual  and  segment  markets  can  be 
collected  through  this  reservation  system  and  put  into  a  database.  Then,  through  mixture 
modeling, a list of recommended film contents that a mobile phone user would most likely to 
reserve  is  shown  on  the  application  screen.  From  an  academic  point  of  view,  post-hoc 
segmentation  has  taken  center  stage,  but  in  the  film  industry,  mixture  modeling,  which  is 
rarely used in business, is being used [5]. 
 
2. Mobile Movie Tracking System (MMTS) in China 
 
2.1. Structure of MMTS 

Authors  call  a  system  that  future  moviegoers  will  use  for  searching  for  and  reserving 
movie  tickets through  their  mobile  phones,  Mobile Movie  Tracking  System  (MMTS).  The 
reason that authors used the word “tracking system” is that the system actively recommends 
movies that a user will be most likely to reserve tickets for by tracking down the previous 
movies that the user purchased tickets for and provides the result on the screen instead of just 
showing movies that are playing at the moment. 

MMTS is composed of five systems as shown in Figure 1: proactive (or push based) movie 
information  system,  movie  theater  selection  system,  date/time  selection  system,  payment 
system, and reservation confirmation system.

2.2. Proactive (or push-based) Movie Information System 

A proactive (or push-based) movie information system provides largely two types of 
information.  One  is  provided  by  the  filmmakers  to  attract  moviegoers.  It  is  the  first 
piece of information that a user connects to the application (app.). 

Once the app is downloaded on the mobile phone, the user can see the most popular 
movies that are playing in the theater on the phone screen. If the user has a history of 
purchasing  a  ticket  through  the  application,  mixture  modeling  at  the  application’s 
database  (DB)  will  calculate  which  movies  the  user  would  most  likely  want  to  watch 
and show them on the phone screen instead of the latest movies.

International Journal of  Smart Home 
Vol.7, No.5 (2013) 
 
 

For  the  users  who  purchased  tickets  on  the  app  before,  information  such  as  the 
frequency  of  watching  movies,  time  period,  type  (genre  and  country  of  origin)  of  the 
movie,  number  of  people  accompanying  him,  and  the  price  paid  (each  movie  might 
have  a  different  price  in  China)  gets  recorded  on  the  DB  of  this  movie  company.  In 
particular,  for  users  who  purchased  a  VIP  card,  which  is  widely  used  in  the  movie 
industry in China, demographic variables can also be included on the DB. 

If a moviegoer has n number of movie watching records, the probability (pns) of one 
record i showing up on a specific segmented market s shows up as the likelihood of the 
movie watching record yn showing up under (θs), the condition (θ) of the variables of 
the  specific  segmented  market  s  (Formula  1).  In  other  words,  it  adopts  a  fuzzy 
clustering algorithm. The probability density function at this point can take on various 
forms of normal distribution, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. Irrespective of 
the  scale,  mixture  modeling  can  include  all  variables  and  calculate  the  probability  of 
choosing a specific object [6, 7].

Therefore, the moment a moviegoer opens the mobile app, he/she sees on the screen 
the result of  what has been already calculated to be the probable  genre,  playing time, 
and theater location of a movie as well as with whom the user would likely watch the 
movie  shown  at  Table  3.  Of  course,  the  now-playing  movies  and  the  future-playing 
movies are already saved on the DB by the movie producers. Therefore, MMTS can be 
called a knowledge based information system [8-10]. 

A  subordinate  system  of  an  active  movie  information  provider  system  is  the 
moviegoer production information system. In this system, real-time moviegoer reviews 
on  the  now-playing  movies  are  provided.  The  recently  established  MMTS  does  not 
simply  provide  all  the  reviews  posted  by  the  moviegoers.  Negative  words  among  the 
reviews are searched as prohibited words in advance, and reviews with these prohibited 
words are not provided on the user’s mobile phone.

2.3. Theater Selection System 

Just  like  the  movie  information  provider  system,  this  system  is  designed  to  target 
customers. The first target applies to the existing users who use the application to search for a 
movie.  The  system  first  suggests  the  theater  where  the  individual  would  visit.  The  visit 
probability is calculated by the mixture model using the previous visit database [11]. 

However, in case of newcomer to application, the proposed system is designed to suggest 
the theaters by using location-based information. The system uses Google Maps to provide 
such geographical information.

2.4. Date/time Selection System 

The proposed system gathers detailed information used for reservation at a specific movie 
theater. The standard process involves the selection of the date and time first and then that of 
the number of tickets and the seats. A scroll bar is placed to increase the interest of the users 
when  choosing  date,  time,  and  number  of  people.  Of  course,  the  mixture  model  makes  it 
possible  to  calculate  the  probability  of  the  preferred  day  and  time  of  the  existing  users. 
Therefore,  as  soon  as  the  user  touches  a  button  to  select  the  preferred  date  and  time  at  a 
specific theater, the screen can provide the day and time often selected previously by the user.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 6. Date and Time Selection 

In case of the Chinese theater company, the moviegoers are shown to have the day-of-the 
week effect. In other words, theaters attract a higher number of visitors on specific days than 
on  the  other  days.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  specific  clients  preferring  specific  days  is 
calculated by tracking the existing moviegoers, and this can be used as illustrated in Figure 6.

2.5. Payment and Reservation Confirmation System 

These two systems implement general and commercialized services. The payment system 
must  include  the  selection  of  a  payment  method  and  link  the  applicable  discount  system. 
Depending on the payment method, a sub-payment system must be additionally established. 
For example, if a user pays with a credit card, a system called “Alipay” is used in China. 
Figure 8 shows the payment process. 

The  reservation  confirmation  system  lets  moviegoers  check  all  their  previously  selected 
contents on the app. That is, it can display a user’s reservation history, cancelation history, 
point information, and setting options.  

This reservation information is not only provided on the app provided by MMTS but also 
on the user’s mobile phone as an image. This image is automatically sent as the user finishes 
the reservation process.

4. Prospects for MMTS 

Among the MMTSs introduced above, a location-based theater recommendation service is 
what ordinary people are familiar with. On the other hand, workers in the film industry or 
academia  are  not  familiar  with  a  customized  movie  information  service,  theater  location 
providing  service,  and  preferred  day  and  time  providing  service  provided  by  the  mixture 
model  for  the  existing  moviegoers.  However,  users  can  see  their  preferred  movie  genres, 
time, place, and day from the very first page of the screen without having to go through other 
uninteresting  movie  genres,  time  frames,  or  places.  In  order  to  make  this  possible,  the 
collection of and the construction of a DB of the movie watching information of the existing 
users are essential. Therefore, the future MMTS development direction depends on how much 
information of how many users can be accumulated on the DB. 

The second development direction is strengthening the earning power. The existing system 
only has a simple payment function. However, the future payment system must calculate the 
moviegoers’  frequency  of  watching  movies  as  well  as  the  price  elasticity  in  advance,  and 
provide  the  movie  price  by  day/time/genre/number  of  people  accompanying  the  user.  For 
example, some of the moviegoers of this theater frequently watched movies on Tuesdays and 
the  price  was  inelastic,  and  those  that  watched  movies  on  weekends  had  to  pay  an  elastic 
price. Therefore, increasing the movie ticket price on Tuesdays will not reduce the number of 
moviegoers.
