educationalachivement of male intermediate school students of Zanjan in 2014-15. The applied study is 
descriptive-correlational in its data collection method. The participants of the case study were 199 people, 
that is, all the male first grade intermediate students’ of gifted program school in Zanjan (Region 1) during 
2014-15.  According  to  Morgan’s  table,  the  sample  size  was  determined  to  be108  people.  Stratified

collection  tool.  To measure  the students’  academicimprovement  in their  education,  their  previous  year’s 
grade-point  average  (GPA)  was  used.  Analyzing  the  data  based  on  descriptive  and  inferential  statistics 
such  as  Pearson  and  ETA  square  showed  a  weak  significant  inverse  relationship  between  students’ 
educationalachivement  and  social  networks  membership;  an  increase  in  social  networking  slightly

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

 

 

The  current millennium  has  witnessed  the  emergence  of  the  Internet as  a  mass  communication  medium. 
Among  the  many  services  that  the  Internet  offers  its  users,  social  networks  has  been  welcomed  more  warmly. 
Social  networks  are  a  set  of  sites  that  allow  the  users  to  share  their  favorites,  ideas,  and  activities  with  others, 
inviting  others  to  view  their  ideas  and  activities.  A  social  network  is  a  set  of  web-based  services  that  makes  it 
possible for the usersto create public and personal descriptions of themselves, communicate with other members 
of the network, share their information, and choose new connections from the available public descriptions [1]. 

Since the birth of social networks, thousands of such websites have been created all over the world [1]. 
Social networks have become one of the most important and well-known ways of communication all over 

the world [2]. 

These websites have the potential to bring about fundamental changes in the social life of each individual 

both on interpersonal and social levels of relationships [3]. 

The  most  important  effect  of  such  websites  has  commonly  been  considered  to  be  their  potentiality  for 
maintaining and improving existing relationships (Hampton and Wellman [4]). However, one cannot ignore the role 
of  these websites  in establishing new  interpersonal  relationships  [5]. On the other  hand,  although  membership in 
these networks facilitates communication with friends  [2], it interferes with the learning process of the students by 
decreasing their studying time [6].

Students’  improvement  in  their  educational  achievement  is  one  of  the  important  factors  in  pedagogical 
evaluation,  and  the  educational  systemdoes  its  best  to  materialize  this  goal.  In  other  words,  society  and  the

The present study is applied in its objective, and descriptive-correlational in its data collection method. The 
case  study  includes  all  first  grade  intermediate  students  of  male  gifted  program  school  in  Zanjan,  region  1,  199 
people,  during  2014-15.  Based  on  Morgan’s  table,  108  were  selected  as  the  sample,  which  due  to  defects,  103 
people were finally studied. Stratified random sampling method was used for distribution. 
 
Research tools 

Researcher-constructed  questionnaire  was  used  for  dada  collection.  The  questionnaire  has  two  parts.  Part 
One includes information about grade of education, age, and GPA of last year. Part Two of the questionnaire has 
five  questions  regarding  membership  in  social  networks,  type  of  social  network,  hours  spent  social  networking 
every  day,  duration  of  membership,  and  the  reason  for  social  networking.  For  analyzing  the  data,  in  addition  to 
descriptive statistics, inferential statistics such as Pearson and ETA were used.

Because the independentvariable of membership in social networks is nominal, and the variable of learning 
 
performance is interval, ETA square was used, however, to determine the kind of relationship (direct or inverse) the 
Pearson coefficient was used. ETA square (0/1550) shows that the relationship is inverse with low strength, that is, 
the  learning  performance  of  non-memberstudents  is  better  than  member  students.  Moreover,  based  on  the 
obtained  determination  coefficient  (15%),  it  can  be  stated  that  15  %  of  the  variance  or  distribution  of  the 
dependentvariable  of  students’  performance  is  determined  by  the  independent  variable  of  membership  in  social 
networks.  
Third  Question:  Is  there  a  relationship  between  the  amount  of  hours  spent  social  networking  and  students’ 
performance?

Because the hours for social networking as an independent variable ishierarchical, and the learning performance of 
the  student  as  a  dependent  variable  is  interval,  Pearson  coefficient  was  used.  Given  the  fact  that  the  level  of 
significance is more than 0/05 (0/93), there is no significant correlation between the two variables.

Given the  obtained  ETA  square,  membership in  Telegram  and  Instagram,  and the  inverse slightly  strong 
relationship with the learning performance, students who have not used Telegram or Instagram have had a better 
performance  in  comparison  to  those  who  have  used  these  networks.  Moreover,  according  to  the  obtained 
determination  coefficient,  it  can  be  stated  that  10%  of  the  variance  or  distribution  of  the  dependent  variable  of 
students’ performance is determined by the independent variable of membership in Telegram, and 8 % of variance 
or distribution of the dependent variable of performance is explained by the independent variable of membership in 
Instagram.

Because the duration of membership in social networks as an independent variable is hierarchical, and the 
educational  performance  as  a  dependent  variable  is  interval,  Pearson  coefficient  was  used.  Given  the  obtained 
level of significance (0/23) which is more than 0/05 it can be stated that there is no significant relationship between 
the two variables. 
 

CONCLUSION 

 

A  survey  of  social  networks  shows  that  millions  of  users  have  become  members.  These  members  use 
social  networks  for  different  reasons,  including,  communication,  academic  purposes,  and  completing  class 
activities.  The  present  study  investigated  the  relationship  between  social  networking  and  the  educational 
performance  of  students,  and  found  out  that  student  use  Telegram  more  than  other  networks,  and  their  primary

ABSTRACT:  This  study  has  investigated  the  relationship  between  social  networking  and  the 
educationalachivement of male intermediate school students of Zanjan in 2014-15. The applied study is 
descriptive-correlational in its data collection method. The participants of the case study were 199 people, 
that is, all the male first grade intermediate students’ of gifted program school in Zanjan (Region 1) during 
2014-15.  According  to  Morgan’s  table,  the  sample  size  was  determined  to  be108  people.  Stratified 
random  sampling  method  was  used  for  distribution.  Researcher-made  questionnaire  was  used  as  data 
collection  tool.  To measure  the students’  academicimprovement  in their  education,  their  previous  year’s 
grade-point  average  (GPA)  was  used.  Analyzing  the  data  based  on  descriptive  and  inferential  statistics 
such  as  Pearson  and  ETA  square  showed  a  weak  significant  inverse  relationship  between  students’ 
educationalachivement  and  social  networks  membership;  an  increase  in  social  networking  slightly 
decreases their GPAs.

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

 

 

The  current millennium  has  witnessed  the  emergence  of  the  Internet as  a  mass  communication  medium. 
Among  the  many  services  that  the  Internet  offers  its  users,  social  networks  has  been  welcomed  more  warmly. 
Social  networks  are  a  set  of  sites  that  allow  the  users  to  share  their  favorites,  ideas,  and  activities  with  others, 
inviting  others  to  view  their  ideas  and  activities.  A  social  network  is  a  set  of  web-based  services  that  makes  it 
possible for the usersto create public and personal descriptions of themselves, communicate with other members 
of the network, share their information, and choose new connections from the available public descriptions [1]. 

Since the birth of social networks, thousands of such websites have been created all over the world [1]. 
Social networks have become one of the most important and well-known ways of communication all over 

the world [2]. 

These websites have the potential to bring about fundamental changes in the social life of each individual 

both on interpersonal and social levels of relationships [3]. 

The  most  important  effect  of  such  websites  has  commonly  been  considered  to  be  their  potentiality  for 
maintaining and improving existing relationships (Hampton and Wellman [4]). However, one cannot ignore the role 
of  these websites  in establishing new  interpersonal  relationships  [5]. On the other  hand,  although  membership in 
these networks facilitates communication with friends  [2], it interferes with the learning process of the students by 
decreasing their studying time [6]. 
 

DISCUSSION 

 

Students’  improvement  in  their  educational  achievement  is  one  of  the  important  factors  in  pedagogical 
evaluation,  and  the  educational  systemdoes  its  best  to  materialize  this  goal.  In  other  words,  society  and  the 
educational  systemare  concerned about  the development  of  students  and their  future  position in the society,  and

expect  that  children and  students  progress  in different aspects  of life, including, cognitive, emotional,  personality, 
skills  and  abilities.  To  achieve  progress  in  students’  education,  one  needs  to  pay  attention  to  the  factors  which 
influence it [7]. 
 
Virtual social networks have become one of the concerns of pedagogics and parents recently because of 
the  students  surfing  the  net  and  playing  online  games.  Social  networks  do  not  just  have  negative  effects,  rather 
they can be used properly in enhancing the learning process [8]. Communicating with others, learning social rules, 
entertainment, and sharing experience are among the most common reasons for using social networks [9]. 
 
Javadinia  (2012)  in  “The  Effect  of  Social  Networks  on  the  Learning  of  Students  in  Birjand  University  of 
Medical Sciences” has found out that students with a lower GPA and performance use social networks more than 
those with a higher GPA and better performance.  
 
Mehmood  and  Taswir  (2013)  in  “The  Effects  of  Social  Networking  on  the  Academic  Performance  of 
Students  in  College  of  Applied  Sciences,  Nizwa,  Oman”  have  found  out  that  these  social  tools  were  useful  for 
sharing and communicating the students’ information.  
Helou  and  Ab-Rahim  (2014)  in  “The  Effect  of  Social  Networking  on  the  Academic  Performance  of 
 
Malaysian Students” have stated that most of the respondents agree that social networking has a positive effect on 
their academic performance. 
 
Al-Rahmi and Othman (2013) in “The Effect of Social Networks on University Students’ Performance” have 
shown the remarkable positive effect of social networks on learning because of the interaction among the students 
and their instructors.

Accordingly,  the  present  study  intends  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  social  networking  and

reason  is  contacting  friends.  It  was  also  found  out  that  students  who  spend  less  hours  social  networking  have  a 
better educational performance in comparison who use more social networking. These findings are consistent with 
Javadinia (2012), but inconsistent with Helou and Ab-Rahim (2014) and Al-Rahmi and Othman (2013). According 
to the findings in the present study, it can be stated that social networks do clearly affect people’s lives, especially 
teenagers  who have had a growing interest in them. Therefore, it is recommended that social  networks and sites 
which  are  appropriate  for  people’s  age  and  in  accordance  with  educational  purposes  be  designed,  students  be 
taught how to correctly use them, and the dangers of using social networks be explained to the students.
