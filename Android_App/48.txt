Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology

vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the

B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

interval 

QT 

interval 

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the 

80 to 120 ms 

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

U wave 

J wave 

The  U  wave  is  hypothesized  to  be  caused  by  the  repolarization  of  the  interventricular 
septum. They normally have a low amplitude, and even more often completely absent. They 
always  follow  the  T  wave  and  also  follow  the  same  direction  in  amplitude.  If  they  are  too 
prominent, suspect hypokalemia, hypercalcemia or hyperthyroidism usually. 

The J wave elevated J-point or Osborn wave appears as a late delta wave following the QRS 
or  as  a  small  secondary  R  wave.  It  is  considered  pathognomonic  of  hypothermia  or 
hypocalcaemia.

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Prema Sundaram, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing  Vol.2 Issue. 5, May- 2013, pg. 191-201 

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones on the low 
end, to enterprise servers and supercomputers on the high end. While less common, Java applets are sometimes 
used  to  provide  improved  and  secure  functions  while  browsing  the  World  Wide  Web  on  desktop  computers.
 

 
•  Android  
Android is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet computers. It 
is developed by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google. Google releases the Android code as open-source, 
under  the  Apache  License.  The  Android  Open  Source  Project  (AOSP)  is  tasked  with  the  maintenance  and 
further  development  of  Android.  The  version  used  here  is  Android  2.2  Froyo  was  released,  based  on  Linux 
kernel 2.6.32 is used to carry out out our project work. 

•  ECLIPSE

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

interval 

QT 

interval 

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the 

80 to 120 ms 

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

U wave 

J wave 

The  U  wave  is  hypothesized  to  be  caused  by  the  repolarization  of  the  interventricular 
septum. They normally have a low amplitude, and even more often completely absent. They 
always  follow  the  T  wave  and  also  follow  the  same  direction  in  amplitude.  If  they  are  too 
prominent, suspect hypokalemia, hypercalcemia or hyperthyroidism usually. 

The J wave elevated J-point or Osborn wave appears as a late delta wave following the QRS 
or  as  a  small  secondary  R  wave.  It  is  considered  pathognomonic  of  hypothermia  or 
hypocalcaemia.

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Prema Sundaram, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing  Vol.2 Issue. 5, May- 2013, pg. 191-201 

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

interval 

QT 

interval 

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the 

80 to 120 ms 

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

U wave 

J wave 

The  U  wave  is  hypothesized  to  be  caused  by  the  repolarization  of  the  interventricular 
septum. They normally have a low amplitude, and even more often completely absent. They 
always  follow  the  T  wave  and  also  follow  the  same  direction  in  amplitude.  If  they  are  too 
prominent, suspect hypokalemia, hypercalcemia or hyperthyroidism usually. 

The J wave elevated J-point or Osborn wave appears as a late delta wave following the QRS 
or  as  a  small  secondary  R  wave.  It  is  considered  pathognomonic  of  hypothermia  or 
hypocalcaemia.

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Prema Sundaram, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing  Vol.2 Issue. 5, May- 2013, pg. 191-201 

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones on the low 
end, to enterprise servers and supercomputers on the high end. While less common, Java applets are sometimes 
used  to  provide  improved  and  secure  functions  while  browsing  the  World  Wide  Web  on  desktop  computers.
 

 
•  Android  
Android is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet computers. It 
is developed by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google. Google releases the Android code as open-source, 
under  the  Apache  License.  The  Android  Open  Source  Project  (AOSP)  is  tasked  with  the  maintenance  and 
further  development  of  Android.  The  version  used  here  is  Android  2.2  Froyo  was  released,  based  on  Linux 
kernel 2.6.32 is used to carry out out our project work. 

•  ECLIPSE

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

T wave 

ST 

interval 

QT 

interval 

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the 

80 to 120 ms 

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

U wave 

J wave 

The  U  wave  is  hypothesized  to  be  caused  by  the  repolarization  of  the  interventricular 
septum. They normally have a low amplitude, and even more often completely absent. They 
always  follow  the  T  wave  and  also  follow  the  same  direction  in  amplitude.  If  they  are  too 
prominent, suspect hypokalemia, hypercalcemia or hyperthyroidism usually. 

The J wave elevated J-point or Osborn wave appears as a late delta wave following the QRS 
or  as  a  small  secondary  R  wave.  It  is  considered  pathognomonic  of  hypothermia  or 
hypocalcaemia.

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Prema Sundaram, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing  Vol.2 Issue. 5, May- 2013, pg. 191-201 

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

The Android SDK includes a mobile device emulator — a virtual mobile device that runs on our computer. 
The emulator lets us develop and test Android applications without using a physical device. This document is a 
reference to the available command line options and the keyboard mapping to device keys. 
 

Remote patient monitoring system enables the doctor who is not in the hospital to know about the details of 
his patient. The values of the bedside monitor in the ICU device are obtained and are uploaded to a server. Then 
it is made available to the doctor. Notification is send in case of abnormality.

IV.  CONCLUSION 

This project shows the patient’s vital parameters such as ECG, heart rate, SpO2, pulse rate and temperature 
are measured using a patient monitoring system. These values are entered into a database and are uploaded into 
a web based server manually; there is scope of entering the database automatically in the future. Also, the entire 
details of the patient suffering from various chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s etc can be sent to a doctor 
sitting abroad in order to analyze and recommend the type of treatment and medicines for the diagnosis of the 
disease.

Abstract— Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinic medicine where medical information is 
transferred through the  phone or internet or other networks for the purpose  of  consulting and  performing 
remote medical procedures or examinations. Telemedicine can be applied to a greater extend in the field of 
cardiology  where  ECG  serves  as  the  major  tool.  This  project  elaborates  the  experience;  a  methodology 
adopted and highlights various design aspects to be considered for making telemedicine in patient monitoring 
system  effective. In this method, the patient’s vital signs  like ECG, heart  rate, breathing rate,  temperature, 
SpO2 are captured and the values are entered into the database. It is then uploaded into the web based server 
and sent to the doctor’s phone using ANDROID technology. It also enables the doctors to instantly send back 
their feedback to the nurse station.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern visionary of healthcare industry is to provide better healthcare to people anytime and anywhere 
in  the  world  in  a  more  economic  and  patient  friendly  manner.  Therefore  for  increasing  the  patient  care 
efficiency,  there  arises  a  need  to  improve  the  patient  monitoring  devices  and  make  them  more  mobile.  The 
medical world today faces two basic problems when it comes to patient monitoring. Firstly, the needs of health 
care’s provider’s presence near the bedside of the patient and secondly, the patient is restricted to bed and wired 
to large machines. In order to achieve better quality patient care, the above cited problems have to be solved. 

As  the  bio  instrumentation,  computers  and  telecommunications  technologies  are  advancing,  it  has  become 
feasible to design more portal vital sign tele monitoring systems to acquire, record, display and to transmit the 
physiological signal from the human body to any location. Recent works in communication technologies have 
inspired the development of telemedicine to a large extent. Telemedicine benefits not only the customers who 
are able to receive health care more efficiently; it also benefits the doctors who can streamline their efforts to 
assist more patients. 

 
A. Tele-Health Care 
Tele-healthcare is the use of information technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. It includes 
anything from medical services at the inpatient or at the outpatient stage. It could even include when a doctor in 
one  hospital  supports  surgery  with  a  doctor  in  another  hospital  somewhere  on  another  continent.  What  the 
doctors  actually  would  like  to  see  is  constant  monitoring  of  those  parameters  so  they  always  know  what  the 
history is and how big the change from yesterday to today be and when you have these findings and have these 
data points available, then a much earlier intervention can take place for a patient.  

Telemedicine can be extremely beneficial for people living in isolated communities and remote regions and is 
currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Patients who live in such areas can be seen by a doctor 
or specialist, who can provide an accurate and complete examination, while the patient may not have to travel or

wait  the normal distances  or times like those from conventional  hospital  or  general  practitioner  visits. Recent 
developments  in  mobile  collaboration  technology  with  the  use  of  hand-held  mobile  devices  allow  healthcare 
professionals in multiple locations the ability to view, discuss and access  patient issues  as if they  were in the 
same room. 

 
B. Telemedicine 
Telemedicine  is  the  use  of  electronic  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  to  support  long 
distance  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  care,  patient  and  professional  health  related  education, 
public  health  and  health  administration.  Telemedicine  can  be  used  as  a  teaching  tool,  by  which  experienced 
medical  staff  can  observe,  show  and  instruct  medical  staff  in  another  location  by  more  effective  or  faster 
examination  techniques.  It  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  cost  of  healthcare  and  increase  efficiency  through 
better management of chronic diseases, shared health professional staffing, reduced travel times, and fewer or 
shorter hospital stays.                 

 
C. Telemonitoring 
Telemonitoring  is  a  medical  practice  that  involves  remotely  monitoring  patients  who  are  not  at  the  same 
location as the health care provider. In general, a patient will have a number of monitoring devices at home, and 
the  results  of  these  devices  will  be  transmitted  via  telephone  to  the  health  care  provider.  Telemonitoring  is  a 
convenient  way  for  patients  to  avoid  travel  and  to  perform  some  of  the  more  basic  work  of  healthcare  for 
themselves. In addition to objective technological monitoring, most telemonitoring programs include subjective 
questioning regarding the patient's health and comfort. This questioning can take place automatically over the 
phone,  or  telemonitoring  software  can  help  to  keep  the  patient  in  touch  with  the  health  care  provider.  The 
provider  can  then  make  decisions  about  the  patient's  treatment  based  on  a  combination  of  subjective  and 
objective information similar to what would be revealed during an on-site appointment. 

Some of the more common things that telemonitoring devices keep track of include blood pressure, heart rate, 
weight, blood glucose, and hemoglobin. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, the provider may 
check these statistics on a daily or weekly basis to determine the best course of treatment. Monitoring a patient 
at home using known devices like blood pressure monitors and transferring the information to a caregiver is a 
fast  growing  emerging  service.  These  remote  monitoring  solutions  have  a  focus  on  current  high  morbidity 
chronic diseases and are mainly deployed for the first world.  

The  Telemedicine  system  consists  of  customized  hardware  and  software  at  both  the  patient  and  specialist 
doctor ends with some of the diagnostic equipments like ECG, X-ray or pathology microscope/camera provided 
at the patient end. Through a telemedicine system consisting of simple computer with communication systems, 
the medical images and other information pertaining to the patients can be sent to the specialist doctors, either in 
advance or on a real time basis through the satellite link in the form of digital data packets. These packets are 
received at the specialist centre, the images and other information are reconstructed so that the specialist doctor 
can study the data, perform diagnosis, interact with the patient and suggest the appropriate treatment during a 
video conference with the patient  end. Telemedicine facility  thus enables  the specialist doctor and the patient 
separated by thousands of kilometers to see visually and talk to each other. This enables the specialist doctor to 
assess  the  physical  and  psychological  state  of  the  patient  and  suggest  treatment.  In  this  way,  the  systematic 
application  of  information  and  communication  technologies  to  the  practice  of  healthcare  rapidly  expands  the 
outreach of the healthcare system. 

 
D. Remote Patient Telemonitoring 
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology  to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional 

clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs. 

Incorporating RPM in chronic disease management can significantly improve an individual’s quality of life. 
It  allows  patients  to  maintain  independence,  prevent  complications,  and  minimize  personal  costs.  RPM 
facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel 
comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly 
important when patients are managing complex self-care processes such as home haemodialysis. Key features of 
RPM,  like  remote  monitoring  and  trend  analysis  of  physiological  parameters,  enable  early  detection  of 
deterioration;  thereby,  reducing  number  of  emergency  department  visits,  hospitalizations,  and  duration  of 
hospital stays. The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community 
and institutional settings. The  time saved as a result  of RPM implementation  increases efficiency, and allows 
healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.  

 
E. Remote Patient Telemonitoring Using Android Technology 
Remote patient telemonitoring  system using  Java enabled  3G  mobile phone enables doctors to  monitor  the 
vital bio signal such as ECG, Respiration rate, heart rate SpO2 and temperature, of patients in ICU/CCU using

the real time waveform and data monitoring function of installed Java based application on the mobile phone. 
This project discusses the benefits of patient monitoring using android technology. It discusses the technology to 
collect data from a patient monitoring system, to feed the same to two separate interfaces displaying the patient 
parameters and details and sync the important information to a web based server. This can in turn accessed by 
the doctor remotely using an application installed in his android phone, which he analyses and sent feedback in 
order to take preventive measures before he reaches the hospital. The physiological parameters like temperature, 
heart rate, ECG, breathing rate and SpO2 are acquired from the patient monitoring  system. Values such as R-
wave amplitude and QRS complex width are also acquired in order to simulate an ECG waveform in the android 
application, which enable the doctors to get a clear scenario of the patient condition.

B.  Patient Parameters   

ECG 
Electrocardiography is a trans thoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a 
device external to the body.  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Fig. 2 Wave description 

 
The  recording  produced  by  this  non-invasive  procedure  is  termed  an  electrocardiogram  (also  ECG  or 
EKG).An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the 
chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, 
such as a pacemaker. 

 Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed 

on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Description 
The interval between an R wave and the next R wave: Normal resting heart rate is between 

Duration 
0.6 to 1.2s 

60 and 100 bpm. 

During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node 
towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P 
wave on the ECG. 

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS 
complex. The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus 
node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval  is, therefore, a good 
estimate of AV node function. 

The PR segment connects the P wave and the QRS complex. The impulse vector is from the 
AV  node  to  the  bundle  of  His  to  the  bundle  branches  and  then  to  the  Purkinje  fibers.  This 
electrical activity does not produce a contraction directly and is merely traveling down towards 
the ventricles, and this shows up flat on the ECG. The PR interval is more clinically relevant. 

The  QRS  complex  reflects  the  rapid  depolarization  of  the  right  and  left  ventricles.  They 
have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has much larger 
amplitude than the P-wave.

interval 

QT 

interval 

The ST segment connects the QRS complex and the T wave. The ST segment represents the 

80 to 120 ms 

period when the ventricles are depolarized. It is isoelectric. 

The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from 
the  beginning  of  the  QRS  complex  to  the  apex  of  the  T  wave  is  referred  to  as  the  absolute 
refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or 
vulnerable period). 

The ST interval is measured from the J point to the end of the T wave. 

160 ms 

320 ms 

The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T 
wave.  A  prolonged  QT  interval  is  a  risk  factor  for  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  and  sudden 
death. It varies with heart rate and for clinical relevance requires a correction for this, giving 
the QTc.

U wave 

J wave 

The  U  wave  is  hypothesized  to  be  caused  by  the  repolarization  of  the  interventricular 
septum. They normally have a low amplitude, and even more often completely absent. They 
always  follow  the  T  wave  and  also  follow  the  same  direction  in  amplitude.  If  they  are  too 
prominent, suspect hypokalemia, hypercalcemia or hyperthyroidism usually. 

The J wave elevated J-point or Osborn wave appears as a late delta wave following the QRS 
or  as  a  small  secondary  R  wave.  It  is  considered  pathognomonic  of  hypothermia  or 
hypocalcaemia.

Heart Rate 
A normal resting heart rate for adult’s ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at 
rest  implies  more  efficient  heart  function  and  better  cardiovascular  fitness.  There  are  many  ways  in  which 
the Heart  Rate speeds  up  or  slows  down. Normal  resting  heart  rates  range  from  60-100  bpm. Bradycardia is 
defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate  below  60  bpm.  However,  heart  rate  from  50  to  60  bpm  are  common  among 
healthy  people  and  do  not  necessarily  require  special  attention. Tachycardia is  defined  as  a  resting  heart  rate 
above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may 
be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia. 

Pulse Rate 
The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level.                              In medicine, 
one’s pulse represents  the  tactile arterial palpation of  the heartbeat by  trained  fingertips.  Pulse  (or  the  count  of 
arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.  

Several pulse patterns can be of clinical significance. These include: 
•  Pulsus alternans  
•  Pulsus bigemnus 
•  Pulsus bisferiens 
•  Pulsus tardus et parvus 
•  Pulsus paradoxus 
•  Tachycardia        
Temperature 
Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. The body is very good at 
keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. 
Normal  human  body  temperature,  also  known  as normothermia or euthermia,  depends  upon  the  place  in 
the body at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person. 

Different  parts  of the body  have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal measurements,  or measurements 
taken  directly  inside  the  body  cavity,  are  typically  slightly  higher  than  oral  measurements,  and  oral 
measurements  are  somewhat  higher  than  skin  temperature.  The  commonly  accepted  average  core  body 
temperature (taken internally) is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  

SpO2 
Usually,  levels  of  SpO2  range  from  96  to  99%  in  healthy  individuals.  However,  when  patients  have 
pulmonary  or  cardiovascular  chronic diseases at the same  time as a common  cold  or pneumonia, the level  of 
SpO2 may drop rapidly. SpO2 lower than 90% is defined as acute respiratory failure. When SpO2 drops by 3 to 
4% from its usual level, even if it is not less than  90%, an acute disease  may be suspected. In some patients, 
usual levels of SpO2 may be below 90%. Most other individuals will have fluctuations of 3 to 4%.  

Depending on individual pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions, the level of SpO2 may be relatively higher 
at rest, even though the level drops considerably during exercise or sleep. As with “normal” body temperature,

Prema Sundaram, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing  Vol.2 Issue. 5, May- 2013, pg. 191-201 

the level of SpO2 varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to record the individual’s level of SpO2 over 
a  long  period,  and  determine  their  typical  range  at  rest  and  at  various  levels  of  activity  so  that  abnormal 
decreases can be detected.

The Android SDK includes a mobile device emulator — a virtual mobile device that runs on our computer. 
The emulator lets us develop and test Android applications without using a physical device. This document is a 
reference to the available command line options and the keyboard mapping to device keys. 
 

Remote patient monitoring system enables the doctor who is not in the hospital to know about the details of 
his patient. The values of the bedside monitor in the ICU device are obtained and are uploaded to a server. Then 
it is made available to the doctor. Notification is send in case of abnormality.

IV.  CONCLUSION 

This project shows the patient’s vital parameters such as ECG, heart rate, SpO2, pulse rate and temperature 
are measured using a patient monitoring system. These values are entered into a database and are uploaded into 
a web based server manually; there is scope of entering the database automatically in the future. Also, the entire 
details of the patient suffering from various chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s etc can be sent to a doctor 
sitting abroad in order to analyze and recommend the type of treatment and medicines for the diagnosis of the 
disease.
