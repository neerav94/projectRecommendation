Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development.

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010.

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.   

6 

 

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

smaller than other IT service firms. Having 50 to 100 employees is considered as a big company for a

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.   

6 

 

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and 

10 

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a 

11 

direction of app development via videoconferencing. Belarus offshore team will work between 12:30 

pm and 8:30 pm, and US team will start their shift 30 minutes before Belarus team takes off work. In 

summary,  US  onsite  team  works  for  8  hours  and  30  minutes;  Indian  team  works  for  9  hours  and 

Belarus  team  works  for  8  hours.  There  will  be  three  30  minutes  gaps  between  shifts  for 

videoconferencing and one hour break for each team, but 19 hours and 30 minutes will be allocated 

toward  app  development  every  day.  Clients  can  review  work  progress  on  a  daily  basis  and  give 

feedbacks. Each US onsite team will be assigned to four projects so that the team can allocate two 

hours  for  each  project.  US  onsite team  will  supervise  offshore  teams’  work  progress, interact  with 

clients, define requirements, and specify tasks for offshore teams (See Figure 1.2).

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

smaller than other IT service firms. Having 50 to 100 employees is considered as a big company for a

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.   

6 

 

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Figure 1.1 (2 Shifts Model) 

 

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and 

10 

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a 

11 

direction of app development via videoconferencing. Belarus offshore team will work between 12:30 

pm and 8:30 pm, and US team will start their shift 30 minutes before Belarus team takes off work. In 

summary,  US  onsite  team  works  for  8  hours  and  30  minutes;  Indian  team  works  for  9  hours  and 

Belarus  team  works  for  8  hours.  There  will  be  three  30  minutes  gaps  between  shifts  for 

videoconferencing and one hour break for each team, but 19 hours and 30 minutes will be allocated 

toward  app  development  every  day.  Clients  can  review  work  progress  on  a  daily  basis  and  give 

feedbacks. Each US onsite team will be assigned to four projects so that the team can allocate two 

hours  for  each  project.  US  onsite team  will  supervise  offshore  teams’  work  progress, interact  with 

clients, define requirements, and specify tasks for offshore teams (See Figure 1.2). 

 

 

Figure 1.2 (24HKF Implementation with 3 global locations) 

12 

Here are more details. Offshore teams consist with a project manager and 5 to 9 app developers and 

are only responsible for one specific project at a time. App designers work closely with US onsite 

teams, which will give more authority to US onsite teams. US project managers lead development 

projects as they will act as middlemen between clients and development teams. Communication with 

clients  is  mainly  done  by  US  project  managers,  but  clients  also  can  contact  other  offshore  sites’ 

project managers when necessary, and vice versa. Because many mobile apps are targeting specific 

US  customers  in  contemporary  culture,  it  is  critical  that  offshore  teams  need  to  understand  US 

contemporary culture while developing. Therefore, offshore sites’ project managers must come from 

local who are culturally aware of US (preferably who had lived in US). Excellent communication skill 

is also required for project managers to mitigate communication barrier.   

 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  mobile  app  development  will  be  benefited  from  24HKF.  24HKF  facilitates  more 

interactions  with  clients  and  quality  controls  for  Agile  and  RAD  approaches.  Also,  24HKF  can 

mitigate risks from communication and cultural barrier. However, it is difficult for small companies or 

startups to implement 24HKF due to requiring a huge financial commitment and lack of management 

capability. As a pilot program, small companies can start with two shifts at offshore site or they can 

joint venture with existing offshore companies, but this paper does not validate the assumptions that 

further research is required.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.   

6 

 

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Figure 1.1 (2 Shifts Model) 

 

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and 

10 

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a 

11 

direction of app development via videoconferencing. Belarus offshore team will work between 12:30 

pm and 8:30 pm, and US team will start their shift 30 minutes before Belarus team takes off work. In 

summary,  US  onsite  team  works  for  8  hours  and  30  minutes;  Indian  team  works  for  9  hours  and 

Belarus  team  works  for  8  hours.  There  will  be  three  30  minutes  gaps  between  shifts  for 

videoconferencing and one hour break for each team, but 19 hours and 30 minutes will be allocated 

toward  app  development  every  day.  Clients  can  review  work  progress  on  a  daily  basis  and  give 

feedbacks. Each US onsite team will be assigned to four projects so that the team can allocate two 

hours  for  each  project.  US  onsite team  will  supervise  offshore  teams’  work  progress, interact  with 

clients, define requirements, and specify tasks for offshore teams (See Figure 1.2). 

 

 

Figure 1.2 (24HKF Implementation with 3 global locations)

Here are more details. Offshore teams consist with a project manager and 5 to 9 app developers and 

are only responsible for one specific project at a time. App designers work closely with US onsite 

teams, which will give more authority to US onsite teams. US project managers lead development 

projects as they will act as middlemen between clients and development teams. Communication with 

clients  is  mainly  done  by  US  project  managers,  but  clients  also  can  contact  other  offshore  sites’ 

project managers when necessary, and vice versa. Because many mobile apps are targeting specific 

US  customers  in  contemporary  culture,  it  is  critical  that  offshore  teams  need  to  understand  US 

contemporary culture while developing. Therefore, offshore sites’ project managers must come from 

local who are culturally aware of US (preferably who had lived in US). Excellent communication skill 

is also required for project managers to mitigate communication barrier.   

 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  mobile  app  development  will  be  benefited  from  24HKF.  24HKF  facilitates  more 

interactions  with  clients  and  quality  controls  for  Agile  and  RAD  approaches.  Also,  24HKF  can 

mitigate risks from communication and cultural barrier. However, it is difficult for small companies or 

startups to implement 24HKF due to requiring a huge financial commitment and lack of management 

capability. As a pilot program, small companies can start with two shifts at offshore site or they can 

joint venture with existing offshore companies, but this paper does not validate the assumptions that 

further research is required.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

smaller than other IT service firms. Having 50 to 100 employees is considered as a big company for a 
specialized mobile app development service firm.

sense,  this  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  as  small  companies  or  startups.  Moreover, 

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development. 

7 

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and 

10 

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a 

11 

direction of app development via videoconferencing. Belarus offshore team will work between 12:30 

pm and 8:30 pm, and US team will start their shift 30 minutes before Belarus team takes off work. In 

summary,  US  onsite  team  works  for  8  hours  and  30  minutes;  Indian  team  works  for  9  hours  and 

Belarus  team  works  for  8  hours.  There  will  be  three  30  minutes  gaps  between  shifts  for 

videoconferencing and one hour break for each team, but 19 hours and 30 minutes will be allocated 

toward  app  development  every  day.  Clients  can  review  work  progress  on  a  daily  basis  and  give 

feedbacks. Each US onsite team will be assigned to four projects so that the team can allocate two 

hours  for  each  project.  US  onsite team  will  supervise  offshore  teams’  work  progress, interact  with 

clients, define requirements, and specify tasks for offshore teams (See Figure 1.2). 

 

 

Figure 1.2 (24HKF Implementation with 3 global locations) 

12 

Here are more details. Offshore teams consist with a project manager and 5 to 9 app developers and 

are only responsible for one specific project at a time. App designers work closely with US onsite 

teams, which will give more authority to US onsite teams. US project managers lead development 

projects as they will act as middlemen between clients and development teams. Communication with 

clients  is  mainly  done  by  US  project  managers,  but  clients  also  can  contact  other  offshore  sites’ 

project managers when necessary, and vice versa. Because many mobile apps are targeting specific 

US  customers  in  contemporary  culture,  it  is  critical  that  offshore  teams  need  to  understand  US 

contemporary culture while developing. Therefore, offshore sites’ project managers must come from 

local who are culturally aware of US (preferably who had lived in US). Excellent communication skill 

is also required for project managers to mitigate communication barrier.   

 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  mobile  app  development  will  be  benefited  from  24HKF.  24HKF  facilitates  more 

interactions  with  clients  and  quality  controls  for  Agile  and  RAD  approaches.  Also,  24HKF  can 

mitigate risks from communication and cultural barrier. However, it is difficult for small companies or 

startups to implement 24HKF due to requiring a huge financial commitment and lack of management 

capability. As a pilot program, small companies can start with two shifts at offshore site or they can 

joint venture with existing offshore companies, but this paper does not validate the assumptions that 

further research is required.

Abstract 

Mobile application market is one of the most rapidly growing  markets. The market will reach $58 

billion  by  2014  and  it  has  created  many  business  opportunities.  However,  hiring  skillful  app 

developers is very expensive in US, and traditional offshore has communication issues when using 

Agile or RAD approaches.   

 

24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) paradigm can solve the addressed issues. 24HKF can utilize 

both RAD and Agile approaches with more interactions with clients, and doing so improving quality 

of  outputs  and  mitigating  communication  barrier  issues  will  be  possible.  This  paper  will  focus  on 

implementing 24HKF in mobile app development as a small company and discuss potential risks. Few 

modifications  and  suggestions  are  made  toward  the  original  concept  to  successfully  implement 

24HKF as a small company. Here are the suggestions: 

  Before the actual implementation, start with two shifts at the offshore site as a pilot project 

 

Joint venture with existing offshore companies, but there will be more potential risks 

  US site team will handle multiple projects 

  US site team will allocate more time with clients and supervise ongoing projects 

 

Overall, despite the challenges of implementing 24HKF as a small company, 24HKF still offers many 

competitive advantages that 24HKF will be shown as a benchmark model for offshoring mobile app 

development.

Introduction: 24-Hour Knowledge Factory (24HFK) Paradigm 

24HKF1

  is a new paradigm that connects globally distributed teams (GDTs) in different time zones to 

work on a project or around the clock (Gupta 227). 24HKF can be considered as a global three-shift 

model which each shift can work during the daytime. Based on “the Role of Information Resource 

Management in Enabling the 24-Hour Knowledge factory” (Seshasai & Gupta 2007), here are key 

main advantages of 24HKF: 

•  Project (development) cycle is faster by performing work over a 24-hour period. 

•  Overall efficiency and productive are improved. 

•  Bottlenecks issues will be reduced on a sequential basis projects. 

•  GDTs can work the normal daytime period (9 am to 5 pm) to maintain work productivity for 

long term projects. 

•  24HKF endorses better team coordination and quality control than traditional offshore that 

can provide semi-structured works. 

 

Software development is one of the areas where 24HKF can optimize its structured work. Tasks of 

software  development  can  be  broken:  obtaining  requirements  from  clients,  designing  specs  and 

prototyping codes, and testing codes and receiving feedbacks from clients. With 24HKF, bottlenecks 

caused by sequential processes will be reduced, and it will utilize quality control and supervision.   

 

This  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  in  mobile  app  development.  Here  are  general 

characteristics of mobile application development. First, most mobile app development projects are 

outsourced or offshored. Second, most mobile app development projects use Agile (Agile Software 

Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  approach,  which  requires  extensive 

interactions with clients. Third, many offshore mobile app development firms are small sized2

. In that

smaller than other IT service firms. Having 50 to 100 employees is considered as a big company for a 
specialized mobile app development service firm.

sense,  this  paper  will  focus  on  implementing  24HKF  as  small  companies  or  startups.  Moreover, 

potential issues of 24HKF and suggestions to mitigate risks will be discussed. 

 

Opportunities from Mobile Application Market 

Mobile  application  market  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  markets  despite  the  economic 

recession. Because mobile application market has been continuously evolving and growing rapidly, 

the market growth rate always has exceeded analysts’ expectations. According to Juniper Research’s 

2010 report, they estimated that mobile application market revenue will reach $25 billion by 2015. On 

the other hand, Gartner’s 2011 report forecast the market revenue will reach $29.5 billion by 2013 and 

$58  billion  by  2014.  Considering  that  the  market  revenue  was  only  $4.2  billion  in  2009  and  $5.2 

billion in 2010 (Baghdassarian, et al., 2010), the potential growth of mobile app market is enormous.   

 

There are two main reasons for such rapid growth in mobile application market. First, market share of 

smartphone has been increased exponentially since 2009. The Nielsen Company states that market 

share of smartphone in 2009 was 21%, but they discover that market share of smartphone will exceed 

standard  phone’s  market  share  by  end  of  2011.  Second,  although  competition  arises  in  app  store 

market, each platform has successfully increased their revenues. According to IHS, Apple’s market 

share was decreased from 92.8% to 82.7% in 2010, and yet their revenue was increased by 131.9%. 

Android app store market revenue was also increased by 861.5% in 2010. 

   

This  rapidly  growing  market  brings  many  business  opportunities.  Seeing  Angry  Bird’s  “overnight 

success,” more startups jump into mobile app market everyday (Cheshire). For instance, according to 

McGuire  Entrepreneurship  Program3

  class  of  2011,  6  of  23  venture  projects  are  delivering  their 

services via mobile applications.   

                                           
3  McGuire Entrepreneurship Program is offered by the University of Arizona as a double major. Throughout the 
program, students with different backgrounds (e.g. management, marketing, finance) form a team and work on a 
venture concept for a year. The venture teams will develop ideas to a venture concept, business model, write 
business plan, and finally present it to investors for capitals. For more information, please check the link:

Cost of Mobile App Development is too Expensive 

Even though mobile application stores open the door for everyone to develop and sell their apps in the 

market,  programming  skills  requirement  sets  a  high  barrier  to  entry.  Developing  an  application 

requires to write sophisticated codes in Java or C/C++ with Assembly languages. Outsourcing mobile 

app  development  seems  a  good  alternative  solution  for  individuals  and  small  startups  without 

programming skills. 

 

The  main  problem  comes  from  high  costs  associated  with  outsourcing  development.  With  rapid 

growth in mobile application market, it is not surprising to notice that app developers are high on 

demand  but  short  on  supply  (Light).  Under  the  circumstances,  hiring  app  developers  has  been 

becoming  more  difficult  and  expensive.  It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  cost  since  each  application 

development cost varies depending on complexity of codes and development time. App developers 

usually  charge  $50  to  $150  per  hour  for  each  developer,  and  it  takes  160  hours  to  400  hours  to 

develop an application. The former CEO of AppVee, Ahlund states that the average total application 

developing costs $6,453 if development is done in house; if development is done outsourced, it will 

cost 5 to 10 times more than $6,453. Despite the expensive expenditure on application development, 

skilled app developers prefer to work on their own projects because they expect more than 15 times 

return on their development cost (Ahlund). 

 

An interview with Heinlein clearly demonstrates how expensive and difficult is to hire application 

developers for individuals or small startups. She is a marketing manager at F.I.T., which is one of the 

venture projects from McGuire Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Arizona. F.I.T. provides 

fitness solutions via the web and a smartphone application. Heinlein stated that it is very difficult for a 

startup to hire skilled app developers because skilled app developers do not accept small scaled jobs. 

F.I.T. concludes that they will outsource their mobile app development with $110,000.

Offshore Mobile App Development Service 

Offshore mobile app development can solve the high cost development problems. With technology 

advanced  and new  communication  tools (e.g.  VoIP),  it is  now  feasible  to  offshore  small scaled  IT 

projects. However, even though cost of offshore app development is much cheaper than doing in in-

house, traditional offshore faces a big problem – communication barrier caused by cultural and time 

zone  difference.  Nowadays,  the  majority  of  small  scaled  software  developments  use  Agile  (Agile 

Software  Development)  or  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development),  which  both  emphasizes  active 

interactions  with  clients  and  feedbacks  from  clients  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  a  big  challenge  for 

offshore mobile app development service to meet quality requirements when both clients and offshore 

firms face communication barrier with different time zones, different languages, and different cultures.   

 

Competitive Advantages of 24 Hour Knowledge Factory (24HKF) 

24HKF paradigm is designed not only to mitigate the addressed risks from traditional offshore, but 

also  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity.  Competitive  advantages  of  24HKF  over  traditional 

offshore are significant. App development cycle is much faster than traditional offshore with 24HKF. 

It is critical to develop apps fast and release them before competitions. For instance, over 8,600 apps 

are submitted to Apple App Store in March 2011 (148Apps.biz). Among submitted apps, 60% of apps 

are rejected mainly due to similarity to other apps (Golijan). With 24HKF, clients can develop apps 

faster  than  their  competitions  as  24HKF  facilitates  24  hours  seamless  app  develop  flow  whereas 

traditional offshore only supports 8 to 10 hours work per day.   

 

24HKF  can  mitigate  risks  associated  with  communication  barrier  and  time  difference.  One  of  the 

major concerns  in traditional  offshore comes  from  communication barrier. With  cultural  difference 

and time difference, it is difficult for clients to communicate with an offshore site effectively. 24HKF 

can solve this issue by having US onsite teams. This way, clients can interact with US onsite teams 

without  communication  barrier  caused  by  language  difference.  Ultimately,  24HKF  will  encourage 

more interactions to improve quality control and supervision on ongoing projects.

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Vs. Agile (Agile Software Development) 

Both  RAD  (Rapid  Application  Development)  and  Agile  (Agile  Software  Development) 

methodologies  are  commonly  used  in  mobile  app  development  because  they  intend  to  minimize 

development  time  with  a  minimal  planning.  With  RAD  approach,  clients  actively  participate  in 

planning  and  user  deign  phases  to  make  agreements  on  key  issues  with  development  teams.  Once 

requirements are defined, developers initiate development in construction phase and testing in cutover 

phase similar to the SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) (Shelly 2009). The main advantages of 

RAD are rapid short development time and rapid modifications on prototypes. With a collaborative 

and dynamic atmosphere, it is easier to obtain more requirements from clients. Agile is also designed 

to  minimize  development  process  but  focuses  more  on  incremental  improvements  for  adaptive 

environment (Shelly 2009). In that sense, Agile emphasizes real time communication with clients such 

as videoconferencing. Clients obtain work progress report on a daily basis and provide feedbacks for 

modifications if needed, but it will lead project delays.   

 

Both  RAD  and  Agile  are  commonly  used  in  traditional  offshore.  There  are  two  main  options  for 

mobile app development offshore: hiring individual contractors or offshore the whole development 

project from other business third parties. Agile works better with managing contractors as clients want 

to control and work closely with contractors. Therefore, many agile-management tools are available 

for online websites for hiring contractors. For example, oDesk (http://www.odesk.com/) is a website 

that  utilizes  offshore remote staffing.  The  website  provides  synchronized  communication tools  and 

supervision  tools  which  clients  receive  snapshots  of  work  progress  each  hour.  On  the  other  hand, 

offshore the whole projects from third business parties supports both Agile and RAD, but more IT 

offshore firms appear to endorse agile approach than RAD4

. At this point, it is unclear which software 

development methodology should be implemented with 24HKF paradigm, but theoretically 24HKF 

will work better with both approaches flawlessly than traditional application development offshore. 

                                           
4  Based on Google keyword search, Agile has more query results than RAD or Rapid Application Development.

Communication between clients and developers are critical for both RAD and Agile. By having an US 

onsite  team,  it  will  be  easier  for  clients  to  interact  with  developers  in  US  without  communication 

barrier and time zone difference. In conclusion, choosing RAD or Agile really depends on clients’ 

preferences, but agile approach will be most benefited from 24HKF paradigm. 

 

Location Selection 

To  utilize  24HKF  paradigm,  three  global  locations  in  different  time  zones  need  to  be  placed.  One 

global location will be located in US since they will work closely with clients. India and Belarus are 

chosen for offshore sites with two main criteria: low cost and human resource availability. India is 

chosen because India has outperformed IT offshore market for decades and India is still top number 

one for knowledge-based offshore services (Gartner). Belarus is also chosen for the third offshore site. 

Belarus was considered as the “Silicon Valley” of the former USSR, and now IT offshore is one of the 

fastest growing markets in Belarus with their IT infrastructure (Emigh). With government support and 

cheap labors, Belarus has become very popular for IT offshore targeting European clients.   

 

Three Global Locations Vs. Two Global Locations with Two Shifts 

24HKF primarily endorses global locations with three different time zones with a belief that “a person 

can  work  most  effectively  during  the  normal  daytime  work  period  (roughly  from  9  am  to  5pm)” 

(Seshasai & Gupta 2007). However, as startups or existing small scaled IT offshore firms, setting up 

three  global  locations  can  raise  many  obstacles.  High  startup  and  exit  cost  can  be  a  big  huddle. 

Moreover, having three global locations raises not only cost issue but also scalability issues. Having 

more employees can cause low scalability and agility which can be critical for small firms with low 

cash flow balance. Another main concern comes from management capability. It is difficult for small 

companies  to  set  up  global  two  other  locations,  hire  skillful  mangers,  and  manage  offshore  sites. 

Moreover,  dealing  with  three  different  languages  as  well  as  cultures  will  give  a  great  burden  on 

management.  Therefore,  without  a  huge  financial  commitment  and  experienced  management, 

implementing 24HKF with three global locations may create more risks than benefits. 

8 

 

Despite  the  addressed  risks,  24HKF  still  has  many  benefits  over  a  traditional  offshore  model. 

Operating  two  shifts  at  the  offshore  site  can  reduce  the  addressed  risks.  Here  is  an  example  of 

applying the two shifts model in 24HKF. US onsite team works from 10 am till 6:30 pm (PST), and 

Indian offshore team, which is first shift, takes over the work from 6:30 am till 2:00 pm (IST). Second 

shift comes to work at 1:30 pm and takes over the work after a 30 minute meeting with the first shift. 

Second shift will work from 1:30 pm till 10 pm, and US onsite team takes over the work from the 

second  shift  at  10  am  (PST)  (See  Figure  1.1).  This  way,  24HKF  paradigm  can  function  with  two 

global  locations.  Benefits  from  operating  two  shifts  model  are  clear.  Two  shift  model  has  lower 

startup and exit cost. With less startup and sunk cost, two shifts model is more scalable. The main 

advantage of operating two shifts at offshore site is that management and communication is easier 

than operating three global locations in different time zones. “Use of Collaborative Technologies and 

Knowledge  Sharing  in  co-located  and  Distributed  Teams:  Towards  the  24-h  Knowledge  Factory” 

(Gupta, Mattarelli, et al., 2009) proves there is no significant differences of efficiency and quality of 

outcomes  between  globally  distributed  teams  (GDTs)  and  co-located  teams.  However,  there  is  no 

evidence that operating three global locations for sequential based projects will have the same result. 

Thus, companies should start with the two shifts model as a pilot project for 24HKF implementation. 

Management and GDTs will learn and adapt to 24HKF paradigm with less risks during the pilot test 

stage, and then they can decide whether they want to expand another global offshore site or stay as is. 

Not being able to “follow the Sun” is a big tradeoff for the two shifts model, but it will be easier to 

implement 24HKF with less risks.

Joint Venture with Existing Offshore Companies 

This paper assumes implementation of 24HKF will be done in house. As discussed, small companies 

or startups will face many issues setting up offshore sites due to lack of management capability and 

high  startup  and  exit  cost.  Joint  venture  with  existing  offshore  firms  may  be  easier  for  small 

companies to implement 24HKF. However, there will be more potential issues associated with joint 

venture. Here are the lists: 

  Legal issues 

  Partner selection 

  Management issues and conflict management 

  Standardization  issues  (each  company  has  a  different  national  and  office  culture,  and 

10 

management style) 

  Differences in the level of investment and resources brought by joint venture partners 

 

Role of US Onsite Team 

According to “Towards the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory: Offshore-Onsite Team Dynamics” (Gupta, 

Mattarelli,  et  al.,  2007),  work  performance  and  employee  satisfaction  is  better  when  GDTs  have 

similar  authority  and  work  on  similar  work  task.  However,  unlike  other  professional  offshore, 

interaction  with  clients  is  most  critical  factor  for  success  in  app  development  with  both  RAD  and 

Agile approaches. In that sense, this paper suggests US onsite team to dedicate more time with clients 

to obtain requirements and feedbacks for the projects. Doing so, bottleneck issues caused by waiting 

for responses from clients will be notably decreased and quality of the output will be improved as a 

result. In addition, this approach motivates US onsite development teams to allocate more than one 

project. With an assumption that three GDTs can only handle one app development project, overhead 

cost  of  hiring  extra  personnel  in  US  onsite  will  be  substantial  and  will  not  be  scalable.  If  an  US 

project manager with his/her app development team can handle multiple projects simultaneously on a 

daily basis, operation will be more efficient and lean.   

 

Implementing 24HKF 

Here is a general overview of applying 24HKF in app development. During planning stage, clients 

will actively interact with an US project manager and app designer to define requirements for the app. 

Once defined, the project manager will initiate app development with other two offshore sites. The US 

site will start designing and developing the app between 10:00 am and 6:30 pm (PST). Indian offshore 

team will start their shift at 6:30 am in India, which is 6:00 pm in US (PST). During a 30 minutes 

overlaps,  US  and  Indian  development  teams  will  discuss  about  progresses  US  team  has  made  and 

what needs to be done via videoconferencing. Then Indian offshore teams will take over and continue 

developing (6:30 am – 3:30 pm IST). Belarus offshore team will start their shift at 12:30 pm in their 

time, which is 3:00 pm in India (IST). Both Indian and Belarus team will have a discussion about a 

11 

direction of app development via videoconferencing. Belarus offshore team will work between 12:30 

pm and 8:30 pm, and US team will start their shift 30 minutes before Belarus team takes off work. In 

summary,  US  onsite  team  works  for  8  hours  and  30  minutes;  Indian  team  works  for  9  hours  and 

Belarus  team  works  for  8  hours.  There  will  be  three  30  minutes  gaps  between  shifts  for 

videoconferencing and one hour break for each team, but 19 hours and 30 minutes will be allocated 

toward  app  development  every  day.  Clients  can  review  work  progress  on  a  daily  basis  and  give 

feedbacks. Each US onsite team will be assigned to four projects so that the team can allocate two 

hours  for  each  project.  US  onsite team  will  supervise  offshore  teams’  work  progress, interact  with 

clients, define requirements, and specify tasks for offshore teams (See Figure 1.2).

Here are more details. Offshore teams consist with a project manager and 5 to 9 app developers and 

are only responsible for one specific project at a time. App designers work closely with US onsite 

teams, which will give more authority to US onsite teams. US project managers lead development 

projects as they will act as middlemen between clients and development teams. Communication with 

clients  is  mainly  done  by  US  project  managers,  but  clients  also  can  contact  other  offshore  sites’ 

project managers when necessary, and vice versa. Because many mobile apps are targeting specific 

US  customers  in  contemporary  culture,  it  is  critical  that  offshore  teams  need  to  understand  US 

contemporary culture while developing. Therefore, offshore sites’ project managers must come from 

local who are culturally aware of US (preferably who had lived in US). Excellent communication skill 

is also required for project managers to mitigate communication barrier.   

 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  mobile  app  development  will  be  benefited  from  24HKF.  24HKF  facilitates  more 

interactions  with  clients  and  quality  controls  for  Agile  and  RAD  approaches.  Also,  24HKF  can 

mitigate risks from communication and cultural barrier. However, it is difficult for small companies or 

startups to implement 24HKF due to requiring a huge financial commitment and lack of management 

capability. As a pilot program, small companies can start with two shifts at offshore site or they can 

joint venture with existing offshore companies, but this paper does not validate the assumptions that 

further research is required.
