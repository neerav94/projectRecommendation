Android operating system quickly occupied the smart phone market [1-2].   

The  applications  on  the  market  today  are  mostly  commercial  applications,  and 
contain  a  large  number  of  built-in  advertising  and  redundant  information,  thus 
affecting the user experience. After studying some previous Android applications and 
access  to  large  amounts  of  materials,  we  utilize  the  Java  language,  the  Eclipse 
platform,  Android  ADT  and  the  Android  SDK  to  develop  the  audio  player.  These 
systems  have  a  nice  interface  and  smooth  operation.  These  Apps  won’t  steal  any 
personal information, but can exclude useless information and bring a wonderful user 
experience. 

2    Android Architecture 

We  studied  the  Android  system  architecture.  Android  system  architecture  uses  a 
layered  architecture.  the  Android  architecture  consists  of  four  layers：Linux  kernel, 
Libraries and Android runtime, Application framework and Applications [3-5]. 

2.1 Applications 

Android  app  will  be  shipped  with  a  set  of  core  applications  including  client,  SMS 
program,  calendar,  maps,  browser,  contacts,  and  others.  All  these  application 
programs are developed in Java. 

2.2 Application Framework 

The developer is allowed to access all the API framework  of the core programs. The 
application  framework  simplifies  the  reuse  of  its  components.    developers  can  also 
use  these  frameworks  to  develop  their  own  applications,  thus  simplifying  the 
application  development  architecture  design,  but  must  abide  by  the  principles  of  its 
development framework. 

2.3 Libraries and Android Runtime 

The library is divided in to two components: Android Runtime and Android Library.   
Android  Runtime  is  consisted  of  a  Java  Core  Library  and  Dalvik  virtual  machine.   
The  Core  Library  provides  Java  core  library  with  most  functions.  Dalvik  virtual 
machine  is  register  virtual  machine  and  makes  some  specific  improvements  for 
mobile device.     

Android  system  library  is  support  the  application  framework,  it  is  also  an 
important  link  connecting  between  application  framework  and  Linux  Kernel.    This

by  the  different  components  in  the  Android  system.  They  provide  service  for  the 
developers through the application framework.   

2.4 Linux Kernel   

The kernel system service provided by Android inner nuclear layer is based on Linux 
2.6  kernel,  Operations  like  internal  storage,  process  management,  internet  protocol, 
bottom-drive and other core service are all based on Linux kernel.   

3    Experimental Methods 

Audio  Player  is  achieved  through  the  Eclipse  platform.  In  order  to  develop  android 
app, we will install a plug-in for Eclipse: Android Development Tools (ADT).  Once 
installed, download Android SDK [7-9], install and configure the SDK, then  we can 
develop audio player. It defines the interface in the Application Framework layer, and 
then acquires  music  files through  ContentResolver in the  Android Framework layer. 
Finally,  plays  the  music  by  using  the  Service  component  calling  the  MediaPlayer 
class in the Libraries layer. The system structure is shown in Figure 1.

The main interface module is the entrance of the application. Users will see the 
main  interface  modules  after  starting  the  application.  The  module  itself  does  not 
reflect any of the information to the user, just call list module to display.  Three lists 
are demonstrated: music list, album list and artists list. The main interface module is

access  to  the  SD  card.  The  static  method  acquires  the  SD  card  audio  resources  by 
using  Cursor  class  method  provided  by  Android  system,  and  will  turns  the  received 
audio  resources  into  a  List  class  instance  objects.  The  members  of  List  are  the 
JavaBean – Music used in the app. The List Array will eventually be returned to the

machine  is  register  virtual  machine  and  makes  some  specific  improvements  for 
mobile device.     

Android  system  library  is  support  the  application  framework,  it  is  also  an 
important  link  connecting  between  application  framework  and  Linux  Kernel.    This 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.31 (MulGraB 2013)Copyright © 2013 SERSC223system library is developed in C or C++ language. These libraries can also be utilized 
by  the  different  components  in  the  Android  system.  They  provide  service  for  the 
developers through the application framework.   

2.4 Linux Kernel   

The kernel system service provided by Android inner nuclear layer is based on Linux 
2.6  kernel,  Operations  like  internal  storage,  process  management,  internet  protocol, 
bottom-drive and other core service are all based on Linux kernel.   

3    Experimental Methods 

Audio  Player  is  achieved  through  the  Eclipse  platform.  In  order  to  develop  android 
app, we will install a plug-in for Eclipse: Android Development Tools (ADT).  Once 
installed, download Android SDK [7-9], install and configure the SDK, then  we can 
develop audio player. It defines the interface in the Application Framework layer, and 
then acquires  music  files through  ContentResolver in the  Android Framework layer. 
Finally,  plays  the  music  by  using  the  Service  component  calling  the  MediaPlayer 
class in the Libraries layer. The system structure is shown in Figure 1.

The main interface module is the entrance of the application. Users will see the 
main  interface  modules  after  starting  the  application.  The  module  itself  does  not 
reflect any of the information to the user, just call list module to display.  Three lists 
are demonstrated: music list, album list and artists list. The main interface module is

Audio file scanner module is responsible for scanning all the audio files on the SD 
card.  The  SongManager  in  this  module  is  a  class,  this  class  has  a  static  method  to 
access  to  the  SD  card.  The  static  method  acquires  the  SD  card  audio  resources  by 
using  Cursor  class  method  provided  by  Android  system,  and  will  turns  the  received 
audio  resources  into  a  List  class  instance  objects.  The  members  of  List  are  the 
JavaBean – Music used in the app. The List Array will eventually be returned to the 
other modules that they calling it. List module MusicListActivity，AlbumListActivity 
and ArtistListActivity module will call this module.   

Adapter  module  is  a  tool  that  maps  instance  objects  of  the  List<?>  class  to  the 
ListView.  The  adapter  module  in  this  application  will  get  a  List  <  Music  >  instance 
objects  that  produced  by  SongManager  module,  and  map  it  to  the  ListView  view 
components in the MusicListActivity and other modules.   

List  module  will  not  show  to  the  user  alone,  but  called  by  the  main  interface 
module.  This  module  has  three  parallel  parts:  MusicListActivity,  ArtistListActivity 

SongManagerSDContentResolverCursorListAdapterArtistListActivityMusicListActivityAlbumListActivityListMusicActivityIntentIntentIntentViewLogicMusicServiceAdvanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.31 (MulGraB 2013)Copyright © 2013 SERSC225and  AlbumListActivity.  The  function  of  them  is  to  display  the  song  list,  artist  and 
album list in the main interface. These parallel modules will call the static method in 
the  SongManager  class  to  acquire  a  List  <Music>  instance  object,  and  then  call  the 
adapter module to handle the obtained List <Music> instance objects. Then, map List 
<Music>  to  its  own  ListView  component.  When  the  user  selects  an  element  of  the 
ListView, this module will encapsulate the information into an intent object and sent 
it to music playback module. 

Music playback module collects the intent sent from List module and analyzed it, 
then calls the background music services to play the audio file. The View components 
provides  player  with  some  basic  functions,  such  as  play,  pause,  fast  forward,  fast 
rewind,  single  play,  random  play,  etc.  This  module  will  make  the  corresponding 
logical  analysis  after  the  users  did  operations  to  the  components.  Appropriate 
response  and  changes  will  be  done  according  to  the  results  analyzed.  Audio  player 
interface is shown in Figure 3.

Abstract.  Since  Google  launched  the  Android  open  source  mobile  platform, 
Android  operating  system  has  occupied  half  of  the  mobile  phone  industry. 
Meanwhile, the Android applications also have a lot of demand. But now some 
Android applications on the market contain a lot of advertising, these redundant 
information  affecting  the  customer  experience.  In  order  to  enhance  the  user 
experience,  in  this  paper,  will  base  on  Eclipse  and  Android  SDK  developer 
tools  which  Google  launched,  use  Java  to  development  a  simple  and  practical 
audio  player  which  paying  attention  to  the  user  experience.  This  audio  player 
will uses ContentResolver and Curor to obtain music files, will uses the Service 
components  calls  the  MediaPlayer  class  for  the  music  playing  in  the 
background. This audio player support the user wonderful music and as well as 
not to bring other negative effects, at the same time users can normally use. 

1    Introduction 

In  recent  years,  the  emergence  of  smart  phones  has  changed  the  definition  of 
mobile  phones.  Cellphone  is  no  longer  just  a  communication  tool,  but  also  inherit 
most  of  the  functionality  of  the  computer,  such  as  surfing  the  Internet,  watching 
videos  and  listening  to  music,  etc.  At  the  same  time,  various  applications  added 
unlimited fun for people's lives. It is certain that the future of the network will be the 
mobile terminal. 

Android  is  a  Linux-based  free  and  open  source  operating  system,  mainly  used  in 
mobile  devices,  such  as  smart  phones  and  tablet  PCs,  developed  by  Google  and  the 
Open  Handset  Alliance.  Android  operating  system  originally  developed  by  Andy 
Rubin,  main  support  mobile  phones.  August  2005  was  acquired  by  Google. 
November  2007,  Google  combined  84  hardware  manufacturers,  software  developers 
and  telecom  operators  formed  the  Open  Handset  Alliance,  jointly  researched  and 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.31 (MulGraB 2013), pp.222-227 http://dx.doi.org/10.14257/astl.2013.31.49ISSN: 2287-1233 ASTL Copyright © 2013 SERSCdeveloped  Android  system.  After  this,  Google  released  the  Android  source  code, 
Android operating system quickly occupied the smart phone market [1-2].   

The  applications  on  the  market  today  are  mostly  commercial  applications,  and 
contain  a  large  number  of  built-in  advertising  and  redundant  information,  thus 
affecting the user experience. After studying some previous Android applications and 
access  to  large  amounts  of  materials,  we  utilize  the  Java  language,  the  Eclipse 
platform,  Android  ADT  and  the  Android  SDK  to  develop  the  audio  player.  These 
systems  have  a  nice  interface  and  smooth  operation.  These  Apps  won’t  steal  any 
personal information, but can exclude useless information and bring a wonderful user 
experience. 

2    Android Architecture 

We  studied  the  Android  system  architecture.  Android  system  architecture  uses  a 
layered  architecture.  the  Android  architecture  consists  of  four  layers：Linux  kernel, 
Libraries and Android runtime, Application framework and Applications [3-5]. 

2.1 Applications 

Android  app  will  be  shipped  with  a  set  of  core  applications  including  client,  SMS 
program,  calendar,  maps,  browser,  contacts,  and  others.  All  these  application 
programs are developed in Java. 

2.2 Application Framework 

The developer is allowed to access all the API framework  of the core programs. The 
application  framework  simplifies  the  reuse  of  its  components.    developers  can  also 
use  these  frameworks  to  develop  their  own  applications,  thus  simplifying  the 
application  development  architecture  design,  but  must  abide  by  the  principles  of  its 
development framework. 

2.3 Libraries and Android Runtime 

The library is divided in to two components: Android Runtime and Android Library.   
Android  Runtime  is  consisted  of  a  Java  Core  Library  and  Dalvik  virtual  machine.   
The  Core  Library  provides  Java  core  library  with  most  functions.  Dalvik  virtual 
machine  is  register  virtual  machine  and  makes  some  specific  improvements  for 
mobile device.     

Android  system  library  is  support  the  application  framework,  it  is  also  an 
important  link  connecting  between  application  framework  and  Linux  Kernel.    This

by  the  different  components  in  the  Android  system.  They  provide  service  for  the 
developers through the application framework.   

2.4 Linux Kernel   

The kernel system service provided by Android inner nuclear layer is based on Linux 
2.6  kernel,  Operations  like  internal  storage,  process  management,  internet  protocol, 
bottom-drive and other core service are all based on Linux kernel.
