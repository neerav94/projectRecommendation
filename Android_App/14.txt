ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in

measures, followed by a C-major groove in

three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

Crossing Over with Brad Mehldau’s Cover of Radiohead’s
“Paranoid Android”: The Role of Jazz Improvisation in the
Transformation of an Intertext*

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

1 of 14

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the

 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a

major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the

change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly

between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

4 of 14

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

 + 

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

4 of 14

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

 + 

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

4 of 14

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

8 of 14

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

4 of 14

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

2. The term “cover” has been used to refer not  only to popular artists’ renditions of recorded songs, but also to jazz
arrangements of post-1950s popular music (Shatz 1998; Yung 2004; Pellegrinelli 2009). This latter use of the term may be
due to the impression that, as with popular music covers, the recording similarly functions as the prescriptive text for a jazz
adaptation. (My thanks go to one of the anonymous reviewers for sharing this point with me and to Walter Everett for
offering his perspective on the term in  a  private correspondence). While my  discussion of intertextuality in this article
focuses on jazz adaptations of contemporary pop songs, I imagine that a broader study of the intertextual relationships
between   jazz   and   popular   performances   of   the   same   song   composed   prior   to   the   1950s   is   possible.   The   question   of
prescriptive authority may be less clear in these cases, however, leading one to discover different kinds of relationships
between these performances. I will return to some of these points at the end of the paper.

one of five different types of transtextual relationships and refers to “the actual presence of one text within another” ([1982]

Crossing Over with Brad Mehldau’s Cover of Radiohead’s
“Paranoid Android”: The Role of Jazz Improvisation in the
Transformation of an Intertext*

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.
Appendix   1   provides   a   transcription   of   the   beginning   of   Radiohead’s   recording   from   Ok   Computer,   and   Appendix   2
provides a complete transcription of Mehldau’s version from Deregulating Jazz.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in 
, the last of which contains a
melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the 
) markedly contrasts
 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

 C-major groove (

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

4 of 14

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

8 of 14

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

2. The term “cover” has been used to refer not  only to popular artists’ renditions of recorded songs, but also to jazz
arrangements of post-1950s popular music (Shatz 1998; Yung 2004; Pellegrinelli 2009). This latter use of the term may be
due to the impression that, as with popular music covers, the recording similarly functions as the prescriptive text for a jazz
adaptation. (My thanks go to one of the anonymous reviewers for sharing this point with me and to Walter Everett for
offering his perspective on the term in  a  private correspondence). While my  discussion of intertextuality in this article
focuses on jazz adaptations of contemporary pop songs, I imagine that a broader study of the intertextual relationships
between   jazz   and   popular   performances   of   the   same   song   composed   prior   to   the   1950s   is   possible.   The   question   of
prescriptive authority may be less clear in these cases, however, leading one to discover different kinds of relationships
between these performances. I will return to some of these points at the end of the paper.

one of five different types of transtextual relationships and refers to “the actual presence of one text within another” ([1982]
1997, 2). My thanks go to one of the anonymous reviewers for this reference.

KEYWORDS: Brad Mehldau, Radiohead, intertextuality, jazz improvisation, cover songs

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the intertextual relationships between popular music songs and their jazz adaptations, or
“covers.”  In  a  jazz  adaptation  of  a  pop  song,   the  improvisatory  section—wedged   between  two  more   or  less  complete
statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz performance. Improvisation affords musicians an opportunity to
create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest in this paper, has the potential to transform the
expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure. Using Brad Mehldau’s live solo piano performance of
Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999] 2000) as a case in point, I show
how his adaptation both highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and heightens the song’s expressions of
anxiety and apprehension.

 

The article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a means to
ground my discussion of Mehldau's recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as the
analog of its lyrical content. In the second section, I explore the intertextual relationships that emerge between Mehldau's
adaptation and Radiohead's rock song, drawing from my transcriptions and analyses of both musical texts.

Received July 2013

[1.1] Within the last fifteen years, cover songs have provided fertile ground for exploring intertextuality in popular music, and
how meaning can differ amongst repetitions of the same musical “text.” (1) Lori Burns (1997), for instance, has shown how
k.d. lang’s live performance (1985) of Joanie Sommer’s “Johnny Get Angry” (1962) transforms the teen-heartache love song
into one about abuse through physical gestures, rhythmic distortion, and changes in the musical structure, inviting listeners
to rethink the power dynamics between men and women. In a similar vein, Mark Butler (2003) has suggested that The Pet
Shop   Boys’   disco   cover   (1991)   of   U2’s   “Where   the   Streets  Have   No   Name”   (1987)   critiques   the   ways   in   which   rock

1 of 14

musicians had constructed authenticity in the 1980s. As Butler proposes, The Pet Shop Boys’ effortless vocal delivery, use of
synthetic sounds, and subversion of pitch and formal structures function as a foil to musical attributes that served as markers
of authenticity, such as laboured vocals, the avoidance of musical loops created through technology, and a clear formal
development.

[1.2] One question that has received less attention in studies on intertextuality is how a jazz adaptation of a popular song can
affect the song’s poetic content. When jazz musicians “cover” a popular song, how might a solo improvisation alter or
enhance the pop song’s potential meanings, particularly in cases where the poetic text no longer serves as the focus of the
performance? (2) As Henry Martin and Keith Waters (2010) confirm, it is not unusual for jazz musicians to crossover to
popular music genres:

Numerous jazz artists are experimenting with the song repertory of the early 1960s and later as a means of
expanding the traditional jazz focus on the great popular standards of 1920–1950. Artists are experimenting
with tunes by numerous rock groups, including the Beatles; the Grateful Dead; Bjork; Nirvana; Radiohead;
Sly and the Family Stone; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; and the Doors. (367)

Elements that distinguish popular music covers from jazz adaptations are not only differences in musical style, but also the
addition of one or more improvised solos that take place after the initial presentation of the pop song. Analogous to a
“head”   in   jazz   practice,   the   initial   presentation   introduces   the   melody,   musical   form,   and   harmonic   progressions   or
“changes” that serve as the basis for the improvised solo section. (3) During the solo section, jazz musicians may embellish
the pop song’s pitch and rhythmic content, compose their own melodic material over the harmonic progressions, or modify
the progressions through a number of chord substitutions. (4) Following an improvised solo section is a recapitulation of the
entire pop song or a portion thereof that rounds off the performance. In a jazz adaptation of a popular music song, then, the
improvisatory section—wedged between two more or less complete statements of the pop song—forms the crux of the jazz
performance: it affords musicians an opportunity to create something new out of an existing musical work and, as I suggest
in this paper, has the potential to alter the expression perceived in the popular song’s lyrics and musical structure.

[1.3] Before moving ahead in my discussion, I would like to clarify what I mean by intertext. Whereas Michael Riffaterre
defined the term as a “corpus of texts, textual fragments, or textlike segments of the socialect that shares a lexicon and . . . a
syntax with the text we are reading (directly or indirectly)” (1984, 142), in an effort to differentiate it from what he deemed it
not to be—one or more specific sources that may have influenced a text, or sources that a text imitates—my use of the term
throughout this article includes direct quotation and adaptation. (5) In this way, I understand intertext to mean a text within a
text, the latter of which seeks to actively reshape the former into something new. With respect to cover songs, the term
intertext will be used to refer to the quoted musical text that serves as a malleable framework which the cover transforms.
Recontextualizing the term for this article, then, not only assimilates music scholarship’s appropriation of terms and concepts
from French literary criticism as a means to rethink relationships between musical texts; it also supports scholarship’s recent
affirmation that, for musicians and listeners, the act of covering a song can be motivated by a desire to create, as opposed to
merely imitate. (6) This is especially the case in jazz adaptations of popular songs, where improvisation, as Bruno Nettl (2013)
confirms, is “the principle element of jazz since it offers the possibilities of spontaneity, surprise, experiment and discovery,
without which most jazz would be devoid of interest.”

[1.4] To explore the role that improvisation can play in intertextual readings of jazz adaptations, I will use Brad Mehldau’s live
solo piano performance of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” (1997) from his promotional album Deregulating Jazz ([1999]
2000) as a case in point. (7) Since his album debut in 1995, Mehldau has garnered attention not only for revamping jazz
standards in unconventional time signatures, such as Richard Rodgers’s “I Didn’t Know What Time It Was” in 
 and Jerome
, but also for his ability to seamlessly fuse together distinct musical genres. (8) His
Kern’s “All the Things You Are” in 
versatility at the keyboard has led to remarkable adaptations of songs written by a wide variety of artists that lie outside of
mainstream jazz—from The Beatles’ “Blackbird” (1968) and Nick Drake’s “River Man” (1969) to Elliott Smith’s “Bottle Up
and Explode!” (1997)––as well as collaborations with opera singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. Listeners who
are   familiar   with   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   will   hear   two   striking   departures   in   Mehldau’s   recording:   a
re-instrumentation of the rock song for solo piano, and two improvised solos, both of which gradually distort the rock song’s

2 of 14

signature motives and harmonic progressions over a repeated musical structure. Using Radiohead’s recording as an intertext
for Mehldau’s performance, I suggest that his arrangement highlights the motivic repetitions in the original rock song and
that his two solos heighten the song’s themes of anxiety and apprehension.

[1.5] This article unfolds in two sections. The first section provides an overview of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” as a
means to ground my discussion of Mehldau’s recording. Here I consider how the rock song’s musical content can be heard as
the   correlate   of   its   lyrical   content.   In   the   second   section,   I   explore   the  intertextual  relationships   that   emerge   between
Mehldau’s   adaptation   and   Radiohead’s   rock   song,   drawing   from   my   transcriptions   and   analyses   of   both   musical   texts.

Analysis of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”

[2.1] “Paranoid Android” was composed and recorded by the alternative rock band Radiohead and appears on their widely
acclaimed album OK Computer (1997). (9) As Radiohead critics and fans point out, the title of the rock song references the
fictional character “Marvin the Paranoid Android” from Douglas Adams’s 1978 BBC radio comedy series The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which was later adapted into a series of books. Unlike Adams’s comedic portrayal of the depressed robot
Marvin,   however,   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   appears   to   depict   a   socially   alienated   and   anxiety-ridden   persona
surrounded by a society consumed by the trappings of capitalism––one of several themes that the album explores. Power
(“When I am king”) and materialism (“gucci”; “yuppies”) generate self-importance (“Why don’t you remember my name”)
and excess (“piggy”), threatening to consume, impair, and silence (“With your opinions which are of no consequence at all”)
in the desire for more (Example 1a). The fear and realization that the capitalist machine has participated in the formation of
the subject and created, as a condition of possibility, the potential to equate the valuation of material goods with identity and
self-worth, provokes a split subject––a “paranoid android” who recognizes that its individual thoughts and ambitions may
also be a product of the capitalist machine (“Please could you stop the noise . . . from all the unborn chicken voices in my
head”). (10) The plea to be cleansed (“Rain down on me from a great height”) from the markers of a capitalist identity proves
futile in the song’s final section; the potential for grace and intervention is met with a cynicism that God may be passive
(“God loves his children, yeah!”), leaving the persona no escape from Pandemonium. That all of the individuals in “Paranoid
Android” are condemned to the same fate, regardless of social status or wealth, lends an ironic twist to the song’s ending.

[2.2] Nadine Hubbs’s description of the lyrics from Radiohead’s Ok Computer as “already oblique in their written form . . .
often intelligible only in fragments” ([2000] 2008, 226) seems especially fitting for describing those in “Paranoid Android.”
Not only does the paranoid android convey a split subject position; the presentation of the song’s lyrics also embodies a
similar aesthetic, engendering antithesis (Example 1b). The lines coalesce into a fragmented dialogue of different speaking
voices,  which   communicate  conflicting  expressive  states––anxiety,   domination,   capricious rage,  apprehension,  alienation,
blindness, and indifference. While the printed lyrics in the CD booklet demarcate some of the voices with quotation marks,
perspective seems blurred when these lyrics are exclusively sung by Radiohead’s lead singer Thom Yorke. We might, for
instance, interpret the fragmented dialogue as representing different facets of the persona’s split subject, and thus more
broadly infer that these conflicting expressive states are inherent in all individuals formed by a capitalist society. Antithesis is
heightened   in   the   final   lyrics,   when   the   persona’s   plea   (“Rain   down”)   sounds   in  counterpoint   with   additional  dialogue
(“That’s it sir/you’re leaving”) and observation. At this point (5:05), the lyrical content recedes from the foreground to the
background, revealing a disturbing and grotesque society. Reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights,
this final scene juxtaposes infernal images (“the dust and the screaming”; “the crackle of pig skin”; “the panic”; “the vomit”)
with “the yuppies networking” (underlined in the lyrics)––fate with ignorance––both of which are underscored with a plea
for grace. The printed lyrics in the CD booklet add a visual dimension to the overall content, depicting turmoil through an
idiosyncratic typography that includes misspelled words and uneven spacing between letters.

[2.3] The music of “Paranoid Android” contributes to the lyrics’ expression of fragmentation, antithesis, and anxiety. Written
for voice, acoustic and electric guitars, Mellotron, and percussion, the rock song contains several features that prevent it from
achieving a state of rest: (1) a through-composed form comprised of three discrete sections––A (0:18), B (1:58), and C
(3:34)––that are framed by an introduction (0:00) and a coda (5:39) (see Example 1 again); (11) (2) tonal pairing within each

3 of 14

formal section, where one of two possible tonics prevail at a given time; (12) and (3) shifts in texture, tempi, and meter.
Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood has acknowledged that “Paranoid Android” fuses together individual compositions
(Jabba 1998), and indeed each main section features its own motives, phrase rhythm, and tonal areas. Collectively, the three
main   sections   in   the  through-composed   form   might   be   best  described   as  a   musical   “triptych”  or   montage   of   discrete
fragments that resist forming a unified whole. (13)

[2.4] A main feature of both the introduction and the A section is that musical repetitions are either truncated or partially
realigned. These varied repetitions can create an unsettling effect in the listening experience because they discourage the
initial unit that precedes each repetition from achieving a sense of stability. The introduction, which establishes the groove
for   the   A   section,   features   a   twelve-bar   unit   that   can   be   subdivided   into   an   eight-bar   phrase   and   four-bar   extension
(Example 2a). Here the four-bar extension repeats the harmonic progression from the last four measures of the eight-bar
phrase, encouraging us to rehear these last four measures as an initiating unit in the next four-bar group (c.f. measures 5–8
and 9–12). (14) The A section—in verse-chorus form—repeats the introduction’s twelve measures at the forefront of its first
verse (measures 13–24), now with Yorke’s vocal line (“Please could you stop the noise I’m trying to get some rest”) added
above. The second phrase in the first verse (“from all the unborn chicken voices in my head?”) presents a truncated version
(measures 25–32), repeating the accompaniment  from the first  eight  bars of the  first phrase and  omitting the four-bar
extension. The grouping structure for the entire first verse can be summarized as || 8 + 4, 8 ||.

[2.5] An example of realignment occurs in the A section’s chorus (measures 33–46), which sounds a variant of the G minor
→ E half-diminished progression from the intro and first verse (see Example 2b). The two phrases that make up the chorus
can be expressed both as || 8 + 6 || and as || 6 + 8 || (see Example 2a again and Appendix 1, measures 33–46, for a full
transcription). (15) This dual reading of the chorus’ grouping structure is attributed to the overlap between the tail-end of the
melody and the repetition of the harmonic progression in measure 40; what sounds like an ending to the vocal line’s first
eight-bar phrase in the chorus is also the beginning of the repeated harmonic progression. The overlap of the vocal line and
repetition of the harmonic progression in measures 39–40 causes a realignment of the hypermetric downbeat within the
repeated G minor–D-minor/F–E 7 progression (cf. measures 33–36 and measures 39–42). Both the verse and chorus are
repeated once more, albeit with a varied melody and different lyrics in the second verse.

[2.6] The tonal pairing in the A section also contributes to the music’s unease. The first two measures of the introduction
suggest that the piece will be in C minor, yet the swerve towards G minor in measures 4–5 calls into question the tonal
hierarchy: Is C minor the tonic, or does C minor function instead as the subdominant (IV) of G minor? The ambiguity of the
song’s tonal center continues in the A section, which opens with the same harmonic progression as the introduction. While
the tonality appears to gravitate more towards G minor as the A section gets underway, this tonal center is weakened by a
reappearing E  (measures 8 and 12). When we reach E 7 at the end of the last chorus, the harmony sides in favor of an
A-minor resolution that initiates the beginning of the B section, leaving the tonal ambiguity of C minor and G minor in the
intro and A section unresolved.

 for three measures, and finally two measures in 

[2.7] Example 3 presents a transcription of the bass and harmonic progression at the beginning of the B section (1:58).
There is a change in musical texture and mood, beginning with a driving syncopated A-minor riff in 
 meter for eight
measures, followed by a C-major groove in

melodic link between C major and A minor via a descending chromatic bass C–B –B  that resolves to A in the repeat of the
entire progression. The shift between the duple and triple meter within the

 meter established by the A-minor riff, and creates a jittery effect that enhances the apprehensive expression in
the steady 
the  lyrics (“Why  don’t  you  remember my  name I  guess  he  does”)  aggressively  delivered  in  Sprechstimme  by Yorke.  The
three-fold repetition of this entire progression culminates in an electric guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood in the last repetition
(3:05), which forms the first of two climactic points in the entire song. Greenwood’s solo ends abruptly with the descending
chromatic bass-line A–A-flat–G–G-flat that resolves to a low A over an F-major chord.

[2.8] The C section (3:34) opens with a slow eight-bar harmonic progression that functions as a ground bass, with vocal
dubbing   and   electronic   vocal   patches   layered   above   Yorke’s   non-syllabic   vocal   line.   As   the   voice-leading   sketch   shows
(Example 4a), the eight-bar progression features two descents, the first in C minor and the second in D minor. The first

descent, which can be heard as a variant of the descending chromatic bass line that adjoins the double-tonic complex A
minor and C major in the B section, resembles a baroque lament bass line. Here its implied descent to G is interrupted via a
harmonic reinterpretation of the B-flat and A that support a G-minor 
chords of a typical lament bass. The second descent in D minor unfolds the interval of a major sixth, which then leads to A
major, the dominant of D minor. The three-fold repetition of this entire eight-bar segment leads to an odd resolution of the
A-major dominant triad at the boundary point between the end of the progression and its beginning (Example 4b); here the
leading-tone strikingly resolves down by half-step rather than up, and the bass ascends a minor third rather than a perfect
fourth. During the first and second repetitions of the entire progression (4:04–5:04), Yorke sings the accompanying lyrics
(“Rain down”) a tenth above the bass. In the third repetition (5:05), a dubbed counter melody (“That’s it sir, you’re leaving”)
sounds   above   Yorke’s   vocal   line.   The   song   concludes   with   a   brash   coda   (5:36)   that   features   a   second   guitar   solo   by
Greenwood over the harmonic progression from the B-section, forming the second climactic point in the song.

 chord and an A-major triad, rather than the   and 

[2.9] Example 5a summarizes the tonal pairing that occurs throughout “Paranoid Android.” (16) The intro and A section
juxtapose C minor and G minor, the B section—A minor and C minor, the C section—C minor and D minor, and the
coda—A minor and C major. The solid arrow indicates a change in scale-step between sections and the dotted arrow, a
change of mode. Each section in the through-composed form juxtaposes two competing tonics, creating a sense of tension
in the listening experience. The tonic, as a potential state of rest, is constantly stymied, forcing the listener to repeatedly
reconfigure  the  tonal  hierarchy  throughout  the  song.  The  matrix in  Example  5b clarifies the  hierarchical  relationships
between all four competing tonics, and Example 5c maps this matrix of tonal relationships on a tetrahedron, marking the
pathway traversed in “Paranoid Android.” This tonal pathway—summarized as C–G–A–C–D–A–C—is not unidirectional,
but rather fluctuates between tonic pairs within each section.

Walter   Everett’s   (2008)   description   of   popular   music   that   subverts   monotonality   seems   especially   fitting   for   the   tonal
disposition of “Paranoid Android”:

Some songs are structurally diatonic and depend on normal tonal chord progressions, and yet no single
overriding tonal center can be appointed conclusively because the song’s various formal sections revolve
around separate tonics (perhaps in pairs suggesting the double-tonic complex of Bailey 1977) and closure is
not provided by any overall directed voice leading. (145)

In “Paranoid Android,” a group of adjacent chords on the local level may appear to gravitate towards a single tonic against a
diatonic background, allowing one to interpret the tones within these chords as adhering to the principles of strict voice
leading. When taken together, however, the groups of chords reveal multiple tonics that project a disjointed tonal structure,
obfuscating the possibility that a unified contrapuntal structure governs the unfolding of the rock song’s peculiarities. (17)

Analysis of Mehldau’s Adaptation of “Paranoid Android”

[3.1]   While   Mehldau’s   performance   of   “Paranoid   Android”   closely   adheres   to   the   pitches   and   rhythms   in   Radiohead’s
recording, the change in instrumentation and two improvised solos over the B and C sections’ harmonic structure mark
extensive points of departure.

Re-instrumentation for solo piano

[3.2] In his adaptation of “Paranoid Android” for solo piano, Mehldau weaves the pitches and rhythms sounded by the voice,
acoustic and electric guitars, and electric bass into a contrapuntal tapestry (Compare Appendix 1 to Appendix 2). The pitch
content in the intro (originally played by the acoustic and electric lead guitar) unfolds in four layers or “voices”—tenor, bass,
accompaniment, and countermelody––which collectively form a composite rhythm of steady eighth and quarter notes. To
differentiate between the first three voices, Mehldau situates the tenor and bass on the registral outskirts of the arpeggiated
accompaniment and slightly accentuates both the tenor’s syncopated major thirds and the bass line. The fourth voice, or
countermelody (measures 6–8) (originally played by Jonny Greenwood on lead guitar) enters above the first three voices in
Mehldau’s adaptation. At the onset of the A section (measure 13), Mehldau adds a fifth layer, the syncopated melody initially

5 of 14

sung by Yorke. By positioning the vocal melody an octave higher than Radiohead’s recording, he distinguishes this layer from
the remaining four throughout the A section.

[3.3] Emerging from Mehldau’s articulation of this five-tiered pitch and rhythmic structure is a dialogue amongst the voices
that underscores the forms of motivic repetition in Radiohead’s recording. Examples 6a and 6b trace how two central
motives in both the intro and A section—the descending major third and the melodic line G–A–B –-E —are woven into
the   contrapuntal  texture.  The  intro  opens  with  a   descending  major  third   G–E   in  the  tenor  voice  (measure  1)   that  is
transposed down a perfect fourth (D–B ) when the tonal center gravitates towards G-minor (measure 5, Example 6a). The
countermelody (measures 6–8) echoes the tenor’s D–B  dyad an octave higher, oscillating between these pitches in a quicker
rhythm   before   descending   stepwise   from   B-flat   to   G.   The   bass   introduces   the   second   motive—the   melodic   line
G–A–B –E —in measures 5–7. The motive’s first three pitches (G–A–B ) sound in retrograde form (B –A–G) in the
countermelody’s melodic descent (measures 7–8), which is immediately followed by a repetition of the G–A–B –E  motive
in the bass (measures 9–11). The G–A–B –E  motive can also be heard in the vocal melody: here the tritone B –E  is filled
in with stepwise descending motion (measures 15–18) at the same time that the G–A–B –E  motive sounds once more in
the bass (measures 17–20). The chorus within the large A section (measure 33ff) preserves the G-dorian sound from the
previous measures, and contains a retrograde form of the descending major-third motive (from D–B  to B –D) in the tenor
voice (Example 6b). The upper neighbor-note E  decorates this major-third motive in the tenor voice, forming the basis for
the chorus’ melody (D–E –D).

[3.4] Mehldau’s arrangement thus makes the relationship between figure and ground, or vocal line and accompaniment, more
complex compared to Radiohead’s recording. By folding together the pitch and rhythmic material under one solo instrument
and by elevating the countermelodies and bass to a more substantial role through articulation and dynamics, the motivic
repetitions in the layered dialogue become more prominent within the contrapuntal texture.

Solo Sections

[3.5] The repetition of the B and C sections’ harmonic structure in Radiohead’s recording creates an opportunity for two
improvised solos. What is remarkable about both of Mehldau’s solos is that he mostly preserves the contrapuntal layers of
the individual lines established in the intro and A section, while also using the musical contents from each section as points
of departure. Mehldau prefaces each solo with the composed material heard in Radiohead’s recording, which functions as a
“head” (see Appendix 2, B section (measures 81–106) and C section (measures 162–77)). This musical material introduces
the themes and harmonic progressions, and it serves as the scaffolding upon which Mehldau builds his improvisation. As my
analysis   below   suggests,   his   approach   towards   developing   the   musical   content   in   both   solo   sections   follows   a   similar
narrative––from lucidity to disorder. I trace these transformations in each solo and then explore how they transform the
intertext upon which they are based.

[3.6] Mehldau begins his first solo over the B section by rhythmically augmenting and composing out motives in different
voices at overlapping time intervals. The first phrase of his first “chorus” (measures 107–15) features three motives, labeled
a–c in Example 7a: (18) (a) C–B –B –G –A, which is based on the chromatic descending line that adjoins the A minor and
C major double-tonic complex (see Example 3, measure 93); (b) an ascending perfect fifth A–E, followed by a perfect-fifth
descent  to  A;  and  (c)  the  A-minor  bass  riff––the  central  melodic  motive  from  the B  section  in  Radiohead’s  recording
(Example 3, measure 81–82). Mehldau presents the descending chromatic motive a in the tenor register in the pickup to the
first chorus of his solo (measure 106) and then plays a varied version an octave below in syncopated dotted-quarter notes. He
couples this rhythmic expansion of motive a with the perfect-fifth motive b at the onset of the first chorus (measure 107–8),
which is repeated (measures 109–10) and then composed-out (measures 111–114) over rhythmically altered repetitions of the
A-minor riff (motive c) (Example 7a).

[3.7] After Mehldau layers motivic variants on top of one another in his first chorus, he transposes portions of the A-minor
riff (motive c) and places their fragments in different registers within the composite contrapuntal texture in his second and
third choruses (Example 7b). At the onset of the second chorus (measure 120), he restates the first half of the A-minor riff
in   the   bass   and   then   transfers   the   second   half   in   the   alto   register,   altering   the   pitches   of   the   riff   (from   G –C–D   to

6 of 14

D –F –G ). Mehldau then repeats the riff in both the bass and tenor register at a composite interval of a major seventh
(measures 122–23), distorting the riff ’s sound through dissonance. In the third chorus (measure 133), the left hand fragments
the A-minor riff in two registers that span a diminished twelfth (G –D) underneath a plateau of repeated As in the right
hand, which function as a pedal point. Here Mehldau disperses the pitches from the A-minor riff amongst the lowest and
highest tones (A and G , and C and D) of the lively arpeggiated eighth notes, generating three separate layers of voices
below the A pedal.

[3.8]   The   trajectory   that   the   motivic   development   follows   in   Mehldau’s   first   solo––from   overlapping   layers   of   motivic
variants to motivic fragmentation via register transfer––reaches its climax in his fourth chorus (measures 147–61). The
A-minor riff in this final chorus is no longer recognizable in its complete form; in its place are sparse and abrupt dissonant
chords that sporadically punctuate the driving eighth notes in the bass (see Appendix 2).

[3.9] In Mehldau’s second solo, which spans seven choruses, he gradually distorts the theme from the C section and alters its
harmonic progressions. He begins the section by stating the “head,” which unfolds over two statements of the section’s
harmonic   progression   (Appendix   2,   measures   162–77).   Similar   to   Radiohead’s   recording,   the   first   statement   (measures
162–69; “part 1”) in Mehldau’s performance features a homophonic texture, wherein the upper voice generally doubles the
bass. In the second statement (measures 170–77; “part 2”), Mehldau layers the primary melody (which corresponds to the
vocal line “Rain down, rain down” in Radiohead’s recording) on top of this homophonic texture, forming parallel tenths with
the bass. Notably, he retains the upper voice from part 1 and places it in the alto register, creating 9–8 suspensions with the
bass (measures 170 and 172). Mehldau effects a seamless transition between a complete presentation of the head and his first
chorus (measures 178–85) by adding a third voice in the soprano register, which sounds a variant of the primary melody. As
with this first chorus and the three that follow, the primary melody is diffused amongst the layered voices, placed in different
registers in the composite contrapuntal texture. Towards the end of his fourth chorus (measures 207–10) and into his fifth
chorus, Mehldau dilutes the layered texture of voices to melody and accompaniment, shifting the listener’s focus to the
harmonic reinterpretation of the bass line and its effects on the C-section’s primary melody.

[3.10] The voice-leading sketch in Example 8 traces Mehldau’s modifications to the bass-line progression throughout his
solo improvisation. The process begins in his first chorus (measures 178–85), where a G  replaces the previous low F in the
D-minor bass descent (compare measure 183 with measures 167 and 175) and moves to II (E-major) before reaching the
dominant of D minor. By substituting G  for F, Mehldau colors the musical surface with a G  major-9th chord, changing the
F in the melody from a consonance into a dissonance. In his second chorus, he restores the major-sixth descent from D to F
in D minor (measures 188–91), but continues this descent to C  via register transfer. The C  of measure 193 proceeds
directly to C  at the onset of his third chorus, yielding an over-arching stepwise descent in the bass that seamlessly connects
the D-minor descent (beginning in measure 189) in the second chorus to the C-minor one that opens the third chorus.
Mehldau extends this C-minor descent in the third chorus to A  (measure 196), reharmonizing F in the melody with a
foreign D  major 
 chord before returning to A . In his fourth chorus (measures 202–29), Mehldau momentarily restores
the C-minor and D-minor “branches” of the bass line (which, put together, resemble a hybrid version of the head’s two-fold
statement of the harmonic progression), only to deviate again from the ground bass in his final three choruses. Mehldau
repeats the lower-neighbor motion around A in the fifth and sixth choruses—which darkens the F in the melody (measures
212 and 220) once again with a remote D  major 
 chord. Similar to choruses two and three, he links the D-minor descent in
the fifth chorus to the C-minor descent in the sixth chorus by extending the step-wise motion in the bass to an interval of an
eleventh (from D to A, measures 212–20, with register transfer). The chromaticism added to the D-minor descent in his fifth
chorus tints the melody with dissonant B-minor and D  major chords (measure 214), and the C  bass suspension on the
downbeat of the sixth chorus causes a disjuncture between the outer voices’ parallel tenths that have dominated the voice-
leading progression in previous C-minor branches. In Mehldau’s final chorus (chorus 7, measure 226), he replaces the initial
C in the C-minor branch with a C , reharmonizing the opening E  in the melody with an A  minor 
 chord. Mehldau closes
the C section with a return to the composed material from Radiohead’s recording over the C-section’s harmonic progression
(“That’s it sir”; labeled “outro” in Example 8), signalling the end of the section.

[3.11]   If   Radiohead’s   “Paranoid   Android”   functions   as   an   intertext   for   listening   to   Mehldau’s   adaptation,   how   might
Mehldau’s arrangement and two solo improvisations affect our prior interpretation of the rock song? Mehldau’s adaptation

7 of 14

communicates a similar aesthetic of fragmentation and antithesis because it preserves the tripartite form and tonal pairing
within each section. Yet the marked differences in instrumentation––an acoustic piano, as opposed to a combination of
electronic   and   acoustic   guitars,   Mellotron,   percussion,   and   voice––and   placement   of   the   instrument(s)   in   the   lateral
scoundscape lends Mehldau’s recording a more introspective and introverted sound, compared to Radiohead’s. Sonic space
seems more narrow in Mehldau’s recording because the piano’s sound is mostly located in the center of the stereo image.
Conversely, in Radiohead’s recording, the vocal and instrumental lines are situated in different locations within the stereo
image, creating the illusion of spatial depth. (19) If the notion of a persona is preserved in Mehldau’s recording, this timbral
“reduction” may invite listeners to perceive this persona as more reclusive or introverted, or perhaps enable listeners to
witness a more private, interior space of the persona.

[3.12] While the absence of lyrics during both solos deprive the improvised pitch and rhythmic material of semantic meaning,
the ways in which Mehldau reinscribes the song’s motives and harmonic structure within both improvisations appear to
heighten the song’s expressions of anxiety and apprehension. Whereas Radiohead develops the musical content in the B and
C sections mostly through repetitions of central motives (e.g., A-minor riff) or melodies (“Rain down”), as well as through
counter melodies that are layered on top of existing ones (“That’s it sir”), Mehldau gradually obscures the content in these
sections by first presenting the motives and harmonic progressions intact and then by distorting them. In Mehldau’s first
solo over the B section (measures 107–61), motives are tightly interlaced in overlapping segments within a contrapuntal
texture, dispersed by means of register transfers, and then fractured. In his second solo (measures 162–233), melodic lines
are moderately layered on top of one another, severed into fragments that appear in different registers, and then distorted
through alterations of the ground-bass progression. Unlike Radiohead’s B and C sections, the gradual anamorphosis of the
motives and harmonic progressions in Mehldau’s choruses over these two sections effects a marked perceptual change in
expression––from   stability   to   instability,   or   perhaps   from   order   to   chaos––which   might   be   mapped   onto   the   listener’s
intertextual reading of “Paranoid Android” in any number of ways (as an analogue to either the persona’s perception of a
society slowly deteriorating due to omnipotence and greed, for instance, or as an analogue to the split persona’s changing
psychological state).

[3.13] The cyclic repetition of each section’s musical structure in both solos also plays a role in heightening the song’s
expression of anxiety. If the unstable repetitions, tonal structure, and abrupt shifts in texture, tempi, and meter prevent the
music from achieving a state of rest in Radiohead’s recording, the repetition of the musical structure during the gradual
deformation   of   the   motives   and   harmonic   progressions   in   Mehldau’s   two   solos   can   create   a   sense   of   restriction   or
claustrophobia.  Here  the  tonal  pairing in  each  respective  musical  structure  resists  resolution, and the  repetition of  this
musical structure only restates the tonal “problem” amidst further motivic decay in a seemingly endless cycle. That the cycle
eventually becomes “warped” itself in the latter half of Mehldau’s second solo––where the boundary point between the end
of the progression and its beginning gradually deteriorates by means of long stepwise descents that connect the D-minor
descent to the C-minor one––alienates the melody from its very surroundings, consequently transforming it into a dissonant,
grotesque form.

Conclusion

[4.1] In an interview for All About Jazz with columnist Fred Yung (2004), Mehldau questions whether the term “cover”
accurately describes a jazz performance of a popular song:

AAJ: You’ve spawned instrumentalists doing Radiohead covers. Has Radiohead sent you a fruit basket?

BM: “Cover” is an unfortunate word—I guess it works pragmatically to describe an interpretation of a tune
that hasn’t been around long enough to be deemed a “standard.” But “cover” also means just playing the
tune—like you’re a wedding band and the bride says, “Can you guys play ‘We’ve Only Just Begun?’” and you
cover it for them. You have to do something more with the tune if you want to transcend just doing a
“cover” in that narrow definition of the word, and with us it’s through the interpretation of the melody and
harmony, our rhythmic approach, and most importantly, the collective improvisation that ensues.

Mehldau’s response rightly captures the tension between fidelity and creativity––what Julie Sanders (2006) has also described
as “the fundamental contradictory impulse towards dependence and liberation implicit in the majority of the adaptations and
appropriations” (11). The term’s tendency to conceal the complex relationships that can occur between repetitions of the
same musical text has led some music scholars to adopt different terms, such as “version” and “base song.” (20) These
distinctions appear to point towards a larger concern, namely the prescriptive power that certain recordings can have over
other recordings or live performances, wherein the recording itself, rather than a notated form of the song, can possess the
authority to subordinate other versions to diminutive types: reproductions and copies. (21) The extent to which Radiohead’s
recording of “Paranoid Android” holds such prescriptive authority over Mehldau’s adaptation can be put into question,
however, when his improvisation is heard as the focal point of his performance; Radiohead’s “original” can function as an
intertext   that   Mehldau’s   “cover”   acts   upon,   displacing   the   power   relations   between   constructed   hierarchies.   As   I   have
suggested in this paper, Mehldau’s adaptation has the potential to recontextualize Radiohead’s prior musical “utterances” and
thus transform or nuance their possible meanings. The rock song’s signature motives and musical structures enter into a
dialogue with the new, extemporized material that has the ability to change or color the “already-written,” encouraging us to
rehear and rediscover the original through its cover.

Footnotes

* In preparing this article for publication, I am very grateful to my colleagues at McGill University, Walter Everett, and the
two anonymous reviewers for their insightful commentary. I would also like to thank Brad Mehldau for his generous support
of this project and for allowing me to publish a transcription of his solo performance of “Paranoid Android.” His level of
musicality and creativity is inspiring, and this article is a tribute to his craft. Finally, a special thanks goes to Nadine Hubbs
for introducing me to the topic of cover songs and for encouraging me to transcribe “Paranoid Android.”

2. The term “cover” has been used to refer not  only to popular artists’ renditions of recorded songs, but also to jazz
arrangements of post-1950s popular music (Shatz 1998; Yung 2004; Pellegrinelli 2009). This latter use of the term may be
due to the impression that, as with popular music covers, the recording similarly functions as the prescriptive text for a jazz
adaptation. (My thanks go to one of the anonymous reviewers for sharing this point with me and to Walter Everett for
offering his perspective on the term in  a  private correspondence). While my  discussion of intertextuality in this article
focuses on jazz adaptations of contemporary pop songs, I imagine that a broader study of the intertextual relationships
between   jazz   and   popular   performances   of   the   same   song   composed   prior   to   the   1950s   is   possible.   The   question   of
prescriptive authority may be less clear in these cases, however, leading one to discover different kinds of relationships
between these performances. I will return to some of these points at the end of the paper.

3. The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz defines “head” as “the theme on which a jazz performance is based” (Kernfeld 2013).
In this sense, “theme” not only refers to the melody, but also to its supporting harmonic progressions and formal design. See
also the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz entry on “Forms.”

4. On the relationship between composition and improvisation, see Larson 2005.

5. See also Riffaterre 1978. Intertextuality as conceived here, then, coincides less with Julia Kristeva’s ([1969] [1969] 1980)
conception of the term and more with Gérald Genette’s appropriation of Kristeva’s concept. For Genette, intertextuality is
one of five different types of transtextual relationships and refers to “the actual presence of one text within another” ([1982]
1997, 2). My thanks go to one of the anonymous reviewers for this reference.

6. This distinction between active and passive imitation recalls Harold Bloom’s (1973) revisionist theory of influence.

7. A different solo version of the rock song can be heard on Mehldau’s album Live in Tokyo (2004). Mehldau has also
recorded “Paranoid Android” for the album Largo (2001) with horns, bass, and percussion.

10. On the relationship between Radiohead’s music and capitalism, Marianne Tatom Letts (2010) similarly comments that the
subject “may think he is acting of his own accord, but he is actually functioning under the influence of the conditions in
which he lives. His actions and his very opinions are shaped and even dictated by market forces. He is told what and how to
consume” (3).

11. In his monograph OK Computer, Dai Griffiths labels the return of the B-section material (5:39) as “Section D” (Griffiths
2004, 36–37 and 48–54), whereas I interpret this section as a coda.

12. Tonal pairing, or “double-tonic complex,” was first introduced by Robert Bailey (1960). See also Bailey 1985, Kinderman
1980, Lewis 1984, and Krebs 1996, among others. In rock music scholarship, see Everett (1992) and (2008).

13. In an interview with Mark Sutherland (1997), Radiohead confirms that Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” served as a
“reference point” for the song’s form. The Beatle’s “Happiness is a Warm Gun” also shares a similar form (I would like to
thank Walter Everett for sharing this point with me).
Return to text

14. All transcriptions in the article are my own. The first one (Ex. 2a) could be rewritten by halving the current values (whole
note = half note), yielding an opening phrase that is four bars instead of eight. Since Brad Mehldau has suggested to me in a
personal correspondence that the C-major groove in the B section can be heard in 7/4, I have opted to keep the current
metrical values in order to align my transcription with his conception of meter and to avoid an irregular measure with 3 1/2
beats.

15. Another plausible reading of the grouping structure in measures 33–46 would be || 2 + 6 + 6 || for the vocal line and
|| 6 + 8 || for the harmony.
Return to text

16. While  each section’s harmonic progression conveys directional tonality (C minor  to  G minor  in the A section, for
instance), the repetition of these progressions leads me to interpret the harmonic structure for each section as examples of
tonal pairing.

17. That “Paranoid Android” resists a single fundamental structure need not deter us from recognizing the value that a
Schenkerian perspective can bring to our understanding of the song’s harmony and voice leading.
Return to text

18. My use of the term “chorus” in this context refers to a complete statement of the harmonic structure, rather than a
refrain in verse-chorus song form.

19. I would like to thank my colleague Richard King for his input on this section. For a stereophonic analysis of “Paranoid
Android” that uses Moore’s (1993) sound-box as a point of departure, see Sears (2011). Sears considers the relationship
between the sound box’s lateral dimensions and the rock song’s musical form.
