Abstract: Mobile messaging applications is rapid adopted globally. They allow mobile users to send messages to individuals or groups 
for very minimal fee, even some are totally free as long as the smartphones are connected to internet. WhatsApp is one of the top mobile 
messaging applications among a handful number of applications that have entered the market. The goal of this paper is to investigate 
the most favourable mobile messaging apps among IIUM students and to provide a feature comparison between a few selected mobile 
messaging applications. Despite the obvious of being a free application, this paper intends to investigate the other factors causing the 
widespread adoption of this mobile application especially among students. An online survey was distributed to 52 students from IIUM by 
using Google Docs to validate which mobile messaging applications are mostly used.

1. Introduction 
 
Mobile  messaging  applications  is  not  a  new  technology.  It 
has been widely used ever since the mobile phone technology 
takes over the telecommunication industry across the world. 
Traditionally,  SMS  or  Short  Messaging  Service  was  first 
introduced in 1991 to send and receive short text messages to 
and 
is  a  mass 
communications  medium  used  by  billions  of  people  around 
the world ever since. Within just a short span of ten years, a 
new medium - mobile messaging application has taken over 
the  SMS  popularity  [7].  Some  of  these  mobile  messaging 
apps  are  WhatsApp  (2009),  Line  (2011),  WeChat  (2011), 
KakaoTalk (2010), Viber (2010), Telegram (2013), and BBM 
(2009). These applications allow the users to send real-time 
text  messages to individuals  or groups of  friends at  no cost 
[8].  The  evolution  of  smart  phones  in  the  market  together 
with  good  package  of  mobile  data  plans  are  naturally  the 
simplest  reason  why  the  trend  has  shift  from  using  SMS  to 
mobile messaging apps.  
 
Going  back  in  time,  SMS  is  built  into  the  GSM  wireless 
standard which allows 160 character text messages to be sent 
to  and  from  any  GSM  mobile  phones,  regardless  of  the 
service providers they are belongs to. The technology further 
evolved to Multimedia Service or MMS, where image, video, 
and sound can be added into the text messages [8].  
 
The basic requirement of a message remains the same when 
smart phones comes into the picture. Users still need to send 
and  receive  images,  videos  and  audios.  On  top  of  that,  the 
trend  has  now  included  location-based  messages  with  the 
addition of GPS as a basic feature in  most smart phones. It 
becomes  a  norm  to  send  messages  to  individual  friend  or 
group  of  friends  without  the  need  to  type  the  details  of 
locations, describing the  meeting place, or trying to explain 
the  songs  that  one  hears.  Furthermore,  it  is  now  free  of 
charge  as  long  as 
the  mobile  data  plan  or  wireless 
connections  are  active.  The  focus  of  this  paper  discussion 
will be on WhatsApp Messenger, which was first introduced 
to  the  market  in  2009  by  Brian  Acton  and  Jan  Koum,  both 
are former employees of Yahoo [18]. It is then taken over by 

Facebook  on  February  19,  2014  [18].  After  WhatsApp  was 
first  introduced  to  the  market,  a  lot  of  other  similar  mobile 
messaging  apps  have  been  emerged  and  continuously 
evolved  [4].  Different  mobile  messaging  apps  provide 
different features.  
 
There was a survey done in Utah State University about their 
use  of  mobile  devices  for  academic  purposes.  It  was  found 
that 54 % of undergraduate students use  mobile devices for 
academic  purposes  [6].  In  another  study,  the  use  of  text 
messaging 
that 
students are positive about using mobile devices in education 
[12]. This leads to the same conclusion for mobile messaging 
apps. 
 
The  use  of  mobile  messaging  apps  among  students  in 
educational  context  is  as  pervasive  as  for  socializing, 
business, and working purposes. These general observations 
and  assumption  on  the  usefulness  of  mobile  messaging 
application in the education sector has led to this paper where 
it  focuses  on  assessing  IIUM  students’  preferences  towards 
which mobile messaging apps. IIUM or International Islamic 
University  Malaysia  is  a  government  institution  for  higher 
education in Malaysia. The students originate from more than 
100 countries representing nearly all regions of the world [1]. 
 
The focus is on WhatsApp Messenger as it is considered to 
be  the  top  among  the  other  mobile  messaging  apps.  Our 
hypothesis 
installed 
WhatsApp Messenger. To validate this assumption, a survey 
has been done to know their preferences of mobile messaging 
apps  including  the  features  and  security  measures  of  those 
mobile  messaging  apps  installed  in  their  smart  phones.  The 
survey  result  shows  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  installed 
among  the  students  as  shown  in  Figure1  where  98%  of 
students are using WhatsApp as their mobile messaging app. 
This  validated  our  hypothesis.  The  detailed  survey  results 
will be discussed in Section 3.

Similarly for Line, the user needs to select their country and 
enter phone number. After that, a verification code that will 
automatically register the account will be sent through SMS 
same as Telegram and Viber. For KakaoTalk, the user only 
needs to enter phone number without registering or logging-
in [2]. The verification code will be sent to the phone and it 
will automatically verify and provide a Talk ID that can be 
used for friends to add in KakaoTalk. In order to use BBM, 
the  user  needs  a  BBID  (BlackBerry  ID).  After  installing 
BBM on  the  device,  the  users  can  create  a  BBID  using  the 
smartphone  and  also  through  online  on  bbid.com.  After 
creating BBID, the  user needs to sign  in  to BBM using  the 
created BBID [5].

C. Chat 
The main feature for a mobile messaging app that one would 
expect is the ability to chat or have a conversation by sending 
unlimited number of messages to individuals and groups in a 
fast-pace  and  conversation-like  style.  Different  mobile 
messaging apps in the market provide their own features that 
make  them  different  from  one  another.  In  WhatsApp,  the 
users  can  send  text,  pictures,  files  from  Gallery,  pictures 
directly  from  camera,  videos,  audio  directly  from  voice 
recorder like walkie-talkie voice message. WhatsApp enables 
the  user  to  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group  chat  with 
maximum of 100 participants per group. 
 
Other  features  included  in  WhatsApp  chat  sessions  are 
attaching  emoticons,  sending  current  location  and  contact 
details.  WhatsApp  also  shows  the  presence  of  the  users  in 
WhatsApp:  online  and  last  seen  [10]  feature.  The  last  seen 
can  be  configured  to  be  hidden  in  Privacy  settings.  Also, 
every line of messages sent has a tick that indicates different 
meaning. Figure 2 shows three different ticks in WhatsApp: 
single grey tick means that the message is successfully sent; 
double  grey  ticks  mean  that  the  message  has  successfully 
delivered  to  the  recipient’s  phone,  and  the  latest  update 
version  of  WhatsApp,  double  blue  tick  means  that  the 
recipient has read the message. 

 
Figure 2: The different ticks meaning in WhatsApp 

 
In  Telegram,  the  user  can  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group 
chat up to 200 participants per group. The chat overview  is 
similar to WhatsApp. In addition to that, Telegram allows a

2. Mobile Messaging Apps - Features 
 
This  section  will  explain  the  selected  mobile  messaging 
appsused  among  IIUM  students:  WhatsApp,  Telegram, 
WeChat,  Viber,  Line,  KakaoTalk,  and  BBM.  All  are 
available in the market but some similar features. We will be 
discussing  on 
their 
compatibility, registration process, chatting function, price of 
sending  messages,  find  friends  capability,  and  ease  of 
changing  to  new  devices. Most  of  the  features  comparisons 
are discussed for the top three  mobile  messaging apps used 
among  IIUM  students  which  are  WhatsApp,  Telegram,  and 
WeChat. 
 
A. Compatibility 
Table 1 shows the comparison between the compatibility of 
the  mobile  messaging  apps  for  different  operating  system, 
namely 
iOS,  Android,  Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
Symbian, PC, and Web. WhatsApp is compatible with iOS, 
Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PC, and Symbian but 
it  does  not  compatible  with  web.  On  the  other  hand, 
Telegram is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
PC,  and  web  but  it  does  not  support  BlackBerry  and 
Symbian. WeChat is quite similar to WhatsApp and it is also 
compatible  with  web.  Meanwhile,  Viber  is  compatible  with 
all OS and PC. Line is only compatible with iOS, Android, 
Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
and  PC.  KakaoTalk 
compatibility  is  similar  to  Line.  Lastly,  BBM  is  only 
compatible with iOS, Android, and BlackBerry. 
 
B. Registration 
WhatsApp  registration  needs  country  code  and  phone 
number in the device itself. The number needs to be entered 
and WhatsApp will do the verification and the user needs to 
enter their name. As for Telegram, users need to select their 
country and enter the phone number upon registration. After 
that, an activation code from Telegram will be sent through 
SMS.  In  order  to  verify  the  user,  they  need  to  key  in  the 
activation code received. After verification, the user can set 
up a public username [13]. 
 
Meanwhile, in WeChat, the user can sign up with WeChat ID 
(unique name that friends can search) and it can be changed 
only  once  [17].  The  phone  number  will  not  be  shown  in 
WeChat. On  the other  hand, for Viber registration,  the user 
needs to select their country and enter the phone number. The 
phone  number  acts  as  the  ID.  The  registration  process  is 
similar  to  Telegram  as  Viber  will  send  activation  code 
through  SMS.  After  verification,  the  user  can  enter  their 
name.

discussing  on 
their 
compatibility, registration process, chatting function, price of 
sending  messages,  find  friends  capability,  and  ease  of 
changing  to  new  devices. Most  of  the  features  comparisons 
are discussed for the top three  mobile  messaging apps used 
among  IIUM  students  which  are  WhatsApp,  Telegram,  and 
WeChat. 
 
A. Compatibility 
Table 1 shows the comparison between the compatibility of 
the  mobile  messaging  apps  for  different  operating  system, 
namely 
iOS,  Android,  Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
Symbian, PC, and Web. WhatsApp is compatible with iOS, 
Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PC, and Symbian but 
it  does  not  compatible  with  web.  On  the  other  hand, 
Telegram is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
PC,  and  web  but  it  does  not  support  BlackBerry  and 
Symbian. WeChat is quite similar to WhatsApp and it is also 
compatible  with  web.  Meanwhile,  Viber  is  compatible  with 
all OS and PC. Line is only compatible with iOS, Android, 
Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
and  PC.  KakaoTalk 
compatibility  is  similar  to  Line.  Lastly,  BBM  is  only

B. Registration 
WhatsApp  registration  needs  country  code  and  phone 
number in the device itself. The number needs to be entered 
and WhatsApp will do the verification and the user needs to 
enter their name. As for Telegram, users need to select their 
country and enter the phone number upon registration. After 
that, an activation code from Telegram will be sent through 
SMS.  In  order  to  verify  the  user,  they  need  to  key  in  the 
activation code received. After verification, the user can set 
up a public username [13]. 
 
Meanwhile, in WeChat, the user can sign up with WeChat ID 
(unique name that friends can search) and it can be changed 
only  once  [17].  The  phone  number  will  not  be  shown  in 
WeChat. On  the other  hand, for Viber registration,  the user 
needs to select their country and enter the phone number. The 
phone  number  acts  as  the  ID.  The  registration  process  is

D. Price 
WhatsApp  is  free  to  download  and  use  for  the  first  year. 
After  one  year  trial,  the  users  have  to  pay  the  subscription 
fees for $0.99 USD or RM 3.50 per year [19]. Figure 6 shows 
that  the  users  may  purchase  the  extension  for  1  year  (RM 
3.50), 3 years (RM 8.75), and 5  years (RM 12.16), and the

to-end  encrypted  messages  [3]  that  do  not  get  stored  on 
servers and the users are able to set a self-destruction time on 
each individual message for extra privacy where it does not 
supported  by  WhatsApp.  The  padlock  symbol  indicates  the 
private chat. One tick in the message means that the message 
is delivered to the Telegram cloud and the recipient has been 
notified,  while  double  checks  mean  that  the  message  has 
been  read  by  the  recipients  [13].  Telegram  also  allows  the 
users to send photo, video, audio, location, and contact. The 
additional  feature  in  Telegram  for  messaging  is  that  it  can 
send  document  such  as  doc,  zip,  and  mp3  files  while 
WhatsApp cannot. 
 
On the other hand, WeChat has richer emoticons and stickers 
as  compared  to  WhatsApp  and  Telegram.  By  default,  it 
comes  with a default set of animated stickers. The user can 
get more stickers by downloading them for free and some of 
them need to be paid. WeChat allows a chat and a group chat. 
It  enables  users  to  send  images,  videos,  location,  and  name 
card.  Other  feature  of  WeChat  is  walkie-talkie  feature  that 
allows  users  to  send  quick  voice  messages  to  another  user. 
Another distinct feature in the latest version of WeChat 5.0 is 
translation service that can translate the text  messages from 
one  language  to  another  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  This  unique 
feature  is  only  available  in  WeChat  and  none  of  the  other 
mobile messaging apps provide such in-app translation [16]. 
For  translation,  WeChat  supports  up  to  20  international 
languages:  English,  Hindi,  Arabic,  Hebrew,  Indonesian, 
Italian,  Japanese,  Korean,  Malaysia,  Polish,  Russian, 
Spanish,  Thai,  Turkish,  Vietnamese,  French,  Mandarin, 
Portuguese,  Urdu,  and  German  [16].  Moreover,  WeChat 
provides a private group feature to set a password for groups 
where  the  participants  must  enter  a  four-digit  code  before 
starting a conversation in a group as shown in Figure 5.

On the other hand, Telegram is an open source app where it 
has  no  subscription  fees  unlike  WhatsApp[15].  WeChat  is 
similar to Telegram as it is also free. However, the payment 
is only applicable for those who want to buy paid stickers. 
 
E. Add Friends 
In WhatsApp, the friend’s phone number must be in the user 
phone’s  contacts  in  order  for  them  to  initiate  a  chat.  Both 
parties  must  get 
installed  beforehand. 
Otherwise,  the  other  party  may  not  find  their  friend  in 
WhatsApp  list  even  though  the  phone  number  is  already  in 
the phone’s contacts. The users might invite their friends who 
do not have WhatsApp installed yet. 
 
Telegram  is  similar  to  WhatsApp  where  the  friend’s  phone 
number  must  be  in  the  user  phone’s  contacts  in  order  for

Abstract: Mobile messaging applications is rapid adopted globally. They allow mobile users to send messages to individuals or groups 
for very minimal fee, even some are totally free as long as the smartphones are connected to internet. WhatsApp is one of the top mobile 
messaging applications among a handful number of applications that have entered the market. The goal of this paper is to investigate 
the most favourable mobile messaging apps among IIUM students and to provide a feature comparison between a few selected mobile 
messaging applications. Despite the obvious of being a free application, this paper intends to investigate the other factors causing the 
widespread adoption of this mobile application especially among students. An online survey was distributed to 52 students from IIUM by 
using Google Docs to validate which mobile messaging applications are mostly used. 
 
Keywords: Mobile messaging apps, mobile instant messaging, smartphones, SMS, WhatsApp, features, IIUM 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Mobile  messaging  applications  is  not  a  new  technology.  It 
has been widely used ever since the mobile phone technology 
takes over the telecommunication industry across the world. 
Traditionally,  SMS  or  Short  Messaging  Service  was  first 
introduced in 1991 to send and receive short text messages to 
and 
is  a  mass 
communications  medium  used  by  billions  of  people  around 
the world ever since. Within just a short span of ten years, a 
new medium - mobile messaging application has taken over 
the  SMS  popularity  [7].  Some  of  these  mobile  messaging 
apps  are  WhatsApp  (2009),  Line  (2011),  WeChat  (2011), 
KakaoTalk (2010), Viber (2010), Telegram (2013), and BBM 
(2009). These applications allow the users to send real-time 
text  messages to individuals  or groups of  friends at  no cost 
[8].  The  evolution  of  smart  phones  in  the  market  together 
with  good  package  of  mobile  data  plans  are  naturally  the 
simplest  reason  why  the  trend  has  shift  from  using  SMS  to 
mobile messaging apps.  
 
Going  back  in  time,  SMS  is  built  into  the  GSM  wireless 
standard which allows 160 character text messages to be sent 
to  and  from  any  GSM  mobile  phones,  regardless  of  the 
service providers they are belongs to. The technology further 
evolved to Multimedia Service or MMS, where image, video, 
and sound can be added into the text messages [8].  
 
The basic requirement of a message remains the same when 
smart phones comes into the picture. Users still need to send 
and  receive  images,  videos  and  audios.  On  top  of  that,  the 
trend  has  now  included  location-based  messages  with  the 
addition of GPS as a basic feature in  most smart phones. It 
becomes  a  norm  to  send  messages  to  individual  friend  or 
group  of  friends  without  the  need  to  type  the  details  of 
locations, describing the  meeting place, or trying to explain 
the  songs  that  one  hears.  Furthermore,  it  is  now  free  of 
charge  as  long  as 
the  mobile  data  plan  or  wireless 
connections  are  active.  The  focus  of  this  paper  discussion 
will be on WhatsApp Messenger, which was first introduced 
to  the  market  in  2009  by  Brian  Acton  and  Jan  Koum,  both 
are former employees of Yahoo [18]. It is then taken over by 

Facebook  on  February  19,  2014  [18].  After  WhatsApp  was 
first  introduced  to  the  market,  a  lot  of  other  similar  mobile 
messaging  apps  have  been  emerged  and  continuously 
evolved  [4].  Different  mobile  messaging  apps  provide 
different features.  
 
There was a survey done in Utah State University about their 
use  of  mobile  devices  for  academic  purposes.  It  was  found 
that 54 % of undergraduate students use  mobile devices for 
academic  purposes  [6].  In  another  study,  the  use  of  text 
messaging 
that 
students are positive about using mobile devices in education 
[12]. This leads to the same conclusion for mobile messaging 
apps. 
 
The  use  of  mobile  messaging  apps  among  students  in 
educational  context  is  as  pervasive  as  for  socializing, 
business, and working purposes. These general observations 
and  assumption  on  the  usefulness  of  mobile  messaging 
application in the education sector has led to this paper where 
it  focuses  on  assessing  IIUM  students’  preferences  towards 
which mobile messaging apps. IIUM or International Islamic 
University  Malaysia  is  a  government  institution  for  higher 
education in Malaysia. The students originate from more than 
100 countries representing nearly all regions of the world [1]. 
 
The focus is on WhatsApp Messenger as it is considered to 
be  the  top  among  the  other  mobile  messaging  apps.  Our 
hypothesis 
installed 
WhatsApp Messenger. To validate this assumption, a survey 
has been done to know their preferences of mobile messaging 
apps  including  the  features  and  security  measures  of  those 
mobile  messaging  apps  installed  in  their  smart  phones.  The 
survey  result  shows  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  installed 
among  the  students  as  shown  in  Figure1  where  98%  of 
students are using WhatsApp as their mobile messaging app. 
This  validated  our  hypothesis.  The  detailed  survey  results 
will be discussed in Section 3.

that  almost  all  IIUM  students

Similarly for Line, the user needs to select their country and 
enter phone number. After that, a verification code that will 
automatically register the account will be sent through SMS 
same as Telegram and Viber. For KakaoTalk, the user only 
needs to enter phone number without registering or logging-
in [2]. The verification code will be sent to the phone and it 
will automatically verify and provide a Talk ID that can be 
used for friends to add in KakaoTalk. In order to use BBM, 
the  user  needs  a  BBID  (BlackBerry  ID).  After  installing 
BBM on  the  device,  the  users  can  create  a  BBID  using  the 
smartphone  and  also  through  online  on  bbid.com.  After 
creating BBID, the  user needs to sign  in  to BBM using  the 
created BBID [5].

C. Chat 
The main feature for a mobile messaging app that one would 
expect is the ability to chat or have a conversation by sending 
unlimited number of messages to individuals and groups in a 
fast-pace  and  conversation-like  style.  Different  mobile 
messaging apps in the market provide their own features that 
make  them  different  from  one  another.  In  WhatsApp,  the 
users  can  send  text,  pictures,  files  from  Gallery,  pictures 
directly  from  camera,  videos,  audio  directly  from  voice 
recorder like walkie-talkie voice message. WhatsApp enables 
the  user  to  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group  chat  with 
maximum of 100 participants per group. 
 
Other  features  included  in  WhatsApp  chat  sessions  are 
attaching  emoticons,  sending  current  location  and  contact 
details.  WhatsApp  also  shows  the  presence  of  the  users  in 
WhatsApp:  online  and  last  seen  [10]  feature.  The  last  seen 
can  be  configured  to  be  hidden  in  Privacy  settings.  Also, 
every line of messages sent has a tick that indicates different 
meaning. Figure 2 shows three different ticks in WhatsApp: 
single grey tick means that the message is successfully sent; 
double  grey  ticks  mean  that  the  message  has  successfully 
delivered  to  the  recipient’s  phone,  and  the  latest  update 
version  of  WhatsApp,  double  blue  tick  means  that  the 
recipient has read the message.

In  Telegram,  the  user  can  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group 
chat up to 200 participants per group. The chat overview  is 
similar to WhatsApp. In addition to that, Telegram allows a

This  section  will  explain  the  selected  mobile  messaging 
appsused  among  IIUM  students:  WhatsApp,  Telegram, 
WeChat,  Viber,  Line,  KakaoTalk,  and  BBM.  All  are 
available in the market but some similar features. We will be 
discussing  on 
their 
compatibility, registration process, chatting function, price of 
sending  messages,  find  friends  capability,  and  ease  of 
changing  to  new  devices. Most  of  the  features  comparisons 
are discussed for the top three  mobile  messaging apps used 
among  IIUM  students  which  are  WhatsApp,  Telegram,  and 
WeChat. 
 
A. Compatibility 
Table 1 shows the comparison between the compatibility of 
the  mobile  messaging  apps  for  different  operating  system, 
namely 
iOS,  Android,  Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
Symbian, PC, and Web. WhatsApp is compatible with iOS, 
Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PC, and Symbian but 
it  does  not  compatible  with  web.  On  the  other  hand, 
Telegram is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
PC,  and  web  but  it  does  not  support  BlackBerry  and 
Symbian. WeChat is quite similar to WhatsApp and it is also 
compatible  with  web.  Meanwhile,  Viber  is  compatible  with 
all OS and PC. Line is only compatible with iOS, Android, 
Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
and  PC.  KakaoTalk 
compatibility  is  similar  to  Line.  Lastly,  BBM  is  only 
compatible with iOS, Android, and BlackBerry. 
 
B. Registration 
WhatsApp  registration  needs  country  code  and  phone 
number in the device itself. The number needs to be entered 
and WhatsApp will do the verification and the user needs to 
enter their name. As for Telegram, users need to select their 
country and enter the phone number upon registration. After 
that, an activation code from Telegram will be sent through 
SMS.  In  order  to  verify  the  user,  they  need  to  key  in  the 
activation code received. After verification, the user can set 
up a public username [13]. 
 
Meanwhile, in WeChat, the user can sign up with WeChat ID 
(unique name that friends can search) and it can be changed 
only  once  [17].  The  phone  number  will  not  be  shown  in 
WeChat. On  the other  hand, for Viber registration,  the user 
needs to select their country and enter the phone number. The 
phone  number  acts  as  the  ID.  The  registration  process  is 
similar  to  Telegram  as  Viber  will  send  activation  code

D. Price 
WhatsApp  is  free  to  download  and  use  for  the  first  year. 
After  one  year  trial,  the  users  have  to  pay  the  subscription 
fees for $0.99 USD or RM 3.50 per year [19]. Figure 6 shows 
that  the  users  may  purchase  the  extension  for  1  year  (RM 
3.50), 3 years (RM 8.75), and 5  years (RM 12.16), and the 
payment can be made through Google Wallet by using debit 
or  credit  card.  On  top  of  that,  the  users  can  pay  for  their

secret chat as shown in Figure 3where the user can send end-
to-end  encrypted  messages  [3]  that  do  not  get  stored  on 
servers and the users are able to set a self-destruction time on 
each individual message for extra privacy where it does not 
supported  by  WhatsApp.  The  padlock  symbol  indicates  the 
private chat. One tick in the message means that the message 
is delivered to the Telegram cloud and the recipient has been 
notified,  while  double  checks  mean  that  the  message  has 
been  read  by  the  recipients  [13].  Telegram  also  allows  the 
users to send photo, video, audio, location, and contact. The 
additional  feature  in  Telegram  for  messaging  is  that  it  can 
send  document  such  as  doc,  zip,  and  mp3  files  while 
WhatsApp cannot. 
 
On the other hand, WeChat has richer emoticons and stickers 
as  compared  to  WhatsApp  and  Telegram.  By  default,  it 
comes  with a default set of animated stickers. The user can 
get more stickers by downloading them for free and some of 
them need to be paid. WeChat allows a chat and a group chat. 
It  enables  users  to  send  images,  videos,  location,  and  name 
card.  Other  feature  of  WeChat  is  walkie-talkie  feature  that 
allows  users  to  send  quick  voice  messages  to  another  user. 
Another distinct feature in the latest version of WeChat 5.0 is 
translation service that can translate the text  messages from 
one  language  to  another  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  This  unique 
feature  is  only  available  in  WeChat  and  none  of  the  other 
mobile messaging apps provide such in-app translation [16]. 
For  translation,  WeChat  supports  up  to  20  international 
languages:  English,  Hindi,  Arabic,  Hebrew,  Indonesian, 
Italian,  Japanese,  Korean,  Malaysia,  Polish,  Russian, 
Spanish,  Thai,  Turkish,  Vietnamese,  French,  Mandarin, 
Portuguese,  Urdu,  and  German  [16].  Moreover,  WeChat 
provides a private group feature to set a password for groups 
where  the  participants  must  enter  a  four-digit  code  before 
starting a conversation in a group as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 6: Payment for subscription fees in WhatsApp 

 
On the other hand, Telegram is an open source app where it 
has  no  subscription  fees  unlike  WhatsApp[15].  WeChat  is 
similar to Telegram as it is also free. However, the payment 
is only applicable for those who want to buy paid stickers. 
 
E. Add Friends 
In WhatsApp, the friend’s phone number must be in the user 
phone’s  contacts  in  order  for  them  to  initiate  a  chat.  Both 
parties  must  get 
installed  beforehand. 
Otherwise,  the  other  party  may  not  find  their  friend  in 
WhatsApp  list  even  though  the  phone  number  is  already  in 
the phone’s contacts. The users might invite their friends who 
do not have WhatsApp installed yet. 
 
Telegram  is  similar  to  WhatsApp  where  the  friend’s  phone 
number  must  be  in  the  user  phone’s  contacts  in  order  for

hand,  WeChat  provide  few  ways  to  add  friends.  The  users 
might add friends through their phone numbers, find people 
nearby by look around feature, shake feature that enables the 
users  to  shake  their  phones  and  WeChat  will  provide  a 
random  list  of  people  around  them  immediately.  The  users 
can also scan QR code of the friends if there are any, and also 
through WeChat ID. 
 
F. Ease of Changing to New Devices 
WhatsApp  allows  the  users  to  change  phone  numbers  on 
their  accounts.  Hence,  it  is  easy  to  change  to  a  new  device 
since the users need to ensure that particular number of SIM 
card is on the phone that the users wish to register WhatsApp 
on  since  the  verification  during  registration  process  will  be 
done  automatically  and  no  username  or  password  required. 
Meanwhile,  Telegram  requires  the  users  to  deactivate  old 
account and create a new one for the new number if the users 
wish to change for a new device.However, in order to login 
to WeChat account, it requires the users to enter a password 
for the number of the device once the users have logged out. 
 
3. Survey 
 
An  online  survey  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  IIUM 
students’  preferences  on  mobile  messaging  apps  including 
the features and security measures of those mobile messaging 
apps installed in their smartphones. The instrument was a 12 
question mixed response survey created using Google Form. 
The  survey  was  distributed  through  “IIUM  Online”,  the 
Facebook group for IIUM students. The respondents for this 
survey  were  52  students  of  IIUM:  67%  of  them  are  female 
while  another  33%  are  male.  The  first  question  determined 
the type of operating system (OS) used for their smartphones 
and found out that Android is the highest with 81%, followed 
by iOS (13%), and Windows Phone (6%). 
 
To  know  the  most  installed  mobile  messaging  apps,  the 
students  were  asked  on  which  mobile  messaging  apps  that 
they installed in their smartphones. The results are tabulated 
in Table 2. The most installed mobile messaging apps were 
WhatsApp  (98%),  followed  by  Telegram  (46%),  WeChat 
(35%),  Viber  (23%),  Line  (21%),  Others  like  Tango  and 
Badoo (8%), KakaoTalk (6%), and BBM (2%).

Students were then asked on why they installed those mobile 
messaging  apps  and  found  out  that  90%  said  that  it  is  free, 
81% said that everyone is using it, 73% said that it is easy to 
use, 21% for attractive features and remaining 2% for Other 
such as to chat. 
 

To find out the number of mobile messaging apps installed in 
their smartphones, students were asked on how many mobile 
messaging apps that they actively used. Most of them (46%) 
opted for one app. 40% opted for two apps, followed by 8% 
for  three  apps,  and  6%  for  more  than  three  apps.  Students 
were  also  asked  on  how  many  number  of  messages  they 
received  via  those  apps  every  day  and  half  of  them  (54%) 
said that they received more than 50 messages per day. 
 
Due to the ambiguity of defining the features of the mobile 
messaging  apps,  students  were  asked  on  how  many  group 
they  have  in  one  mobile  messaging  app  and  the  highest 
(38%)  have  10  groups,  and  only  one  respondent  (4%)  has 
more  than  40  groups.  Students  were  asked  on  what  group 
they  used  for.  The  results  are  presented  in  a  bar  chart  in 
Figure  7  where  92%  of  them  said  to  socialize,  71%  for 
education, 56% for work, 15% for business, and 8% for other 
such as for trip group. 
 
The  pie  chart  in  Figure  8  shows  the  frequency  use  of 
emoticons represented by  “Always”,  “Often”,  “Sometimes”, 
and  “Never”.  Students  were  asked  on  how  often  they  used 
emoticons  in  the  apps.  The  majority  of  40%  of  them  used 
emoticons  “Always”,  37%  used  emoticons  “Often”,  21% 
used  “Sometimes”,  and  only  one  respondent  (2%)  “Never” 
used emoticons.

To  find  out  the  awareness  of  security  among  the  students, 
they were asked whether they are aware that their messages 
are not well-secured and majority of them (69%) said “Yes” 
while another 31% of them said “No”. They were also asked 
whether  they  have  been  spammed  through  those  mobile 
messaging apps and  majority of them (63%) said  “No” and 
37% said “Yes”. Lastly, they were asked on how they knew 
about  the  mobile  messaging  apps  and  the  answer  included 
“Friends”,  “Advertisements”,  “Google  Play”,  and  “App 
Store”.  Most  of  them  (85%)  said  they  knew  about  it  from 
“Friends”, followed by 42% from “Google Play”, 29% from 
“Advertisements”, and 27% from “App Store”.

Abstract: Mobile messaging applications is rapid adopted globally. They allow mobile users to send messages to individuals or groups 
for very minimal fee, even some are totally free as long as the smartphones are connected to internet. WhatsApp is one of the top mobile 
messaging applications among a handful number of applications that have entered the market. The goal of this paper is to investigate 
the most favourable mobile messaging apps among IIUM students and to provide a feature comparison between a few selected mobile 
messaging applications. Despite the obvious of being a free application, this paper intends to investigate the other factors causing the 
widespread adoption of this mobile application especially among students. An online survey was distributed to 52 students from IIUM by 
using Google Docs to validate which mobile messaging applications are mostly used. 
 
Keywords: Mobile messaging apps, mobile instant messaging, smartphones, SMS, WhatsApp, features, IIUM 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Mobile  messaging  applications  is  not  a  new  technology.  It 
has been widely used ever since the mobile phone technology 
takes over the telecommunication industry across the world. 
Traditionally,  SMS  or  Short  Messaging  Service  was  first 
introduced in 1991 to send and receive short text messages to 
and 
is  a  mass 
communications  medium  used  by  billions  of  people  around 
the world ever since. Within just a short span of ten years, a 
new medium - mobile messaging application has taken over 
the  SMS  popularity  [7].  Some  of  these  mobile  messaging 
apps  are  WhatsApp  (2009),  Line  (2011),  WeChat  (2011), 
KakaoTalk (2010), Viber (2010), Telegram (2013), and BBM 
(2009). These applications allow the users to send real-time 
text  messages to individuals  or groups of  friends at  no cost 
[8].  The  evolution  of  smart  phones  in  the  market  together 
with  good  package  of  mobile  data  plans  are  naturally  the 
simplest  reason  why  the  trend  has  shift  from  using  SMS  to 
mobile messaging apps.  
 
Going  back  in  time,  SMS  is  built  into  the  GSM  wireless 
standard which allows 160 character text messages to be sent 
to  and  from  any  GSM  mobile  phones,  regardless  of  the 
service providers they are belongs to. The technology further 
evolved to Multimedia Service or MMS, where image, video, 
and sound can be added into the text messages [8].  
 
The basic requirement of a message remains the same when 
smart phones comes into the picture. Users still need to send 
and  receive  images,  videos  and  audios.  On  top  of  that,  the 
trend  has  now  included  location-based  messages  with  the 
addition of GPS as a basic feature in  most smart phones. It 
becomes  a  norm  to  send  messages  to  individual  friend  or 
group  of  friends  without  the  need  to  type  the  details  of 
locations, describing the  meeting place, or trying to explain 
the  songs  that  one  hears.  Furthermore,  it  is  now  free  of 
charge  as  long  as 
the  mobile  data  plan  or  wireless 
connections  are  active.  The  focus  of  this  paper  discussion 
will be on WhatsApp Messenger, which was first introduced 
to  the  market  in  2009  by  Brian  Acton  and  Jan  Koum,  both 
are former employees of Yahoo [18]. It is then taken over by 

Facebook  on  February  19,  2014  [18].  After  WhatsApp  was 
first  introduced  to  the  market,  a  lot  of  other  similar  mobile 
messaging  apps  have  been  emerged  and  continuously 
evolved  [4].  Different  mobile  messaging  apps  provide 
different features.  
 
There was a survey done in Utah State University about their 
use  of  mobile  devices  for  academic  purposes.  It  was  found 
that 54 % of undergraduate students use  mobile devices for 
academic  purposes  [6].  In  another  study,  the  use  of  text 
messaging 
that 
students are positive about using mobile devices in education 
[12]. This leads to the same conclusion for mobile messaging 
apps. 
 
The  use  of  mobile  messaging  apps  among  students  in 
educational  context  is  as  pervasive  as  for  socializing, 
business, and working purposes. These general observations 
and  assumption  on  the  usefulness  of  mobile  messaging 
application in the education sector has led to this paper where 
it  focuses  on  assessing  IIUM  students’  preferences  towards 
which mobile messaging apps. IIUM or International Islamic 
University  Malaysia  is  a  government  institution  for  higher 
education in Malaysia. The students originate from more than 
100 countries representing nearly all regions of the world [1]. 
 
The focus is on WhatsApp Messenger as it is considered to 
be  the  top  among  the  other  mobile  messaging  apps.  Our 
hypothesis 
installed 
WhatsApp Messenger. To validate this assumption, a survey 
has been done to know their preferences of mobile messaging 
apps  including  the  features  and  security  measures  of  those 
mobile  messaging  apps  installed  in  their  smart  phones.  The 
survey  result  shows  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  installed 
among  the  students  as  shown  in  Figure1  where  98%  of 
students are using WhatsApp as their mobile messaging app. 
This  validated  our  hypothesis.  The  detailed  survey  results 
will be discussed in Section 3.  

is 

that  almost  all  IIUM  students

Similarly for Line, the user needs to select their country and 
enter phone number. After that, a verification code that will 
automatically register the account will be sent through SMS 
same as Telegram and Viber. For KakaoTalk, the user only 
needs to enter phone number without registering or logging-
in [2]. The verification code will be sent to the phone and it 
will automatically verify and provide a Talk ID that can be 
used for friends to add in KakaoTalk. In order to use BBM, 
the  user  needs  a  BBID  (BlackBerry  ID).  After  installing 
BBM on  the  device,  the  users  can  create  a  BBID  using  the 
smartphone  and  also  through  online  on  bbid.com.  After 
creating BBID, the  user needs to sign  in  to BBM using  the 
created BBID [5].

C. Chat 
The main feature for a mobile messaging app that one would 
expect is the ability to chat or have a conversation by sending 
unlimited number of messages to individuals and groups in a 
fast-pace  and  conversation-like  style.  Different  mobile 
messaging apps in the market provide their own features that 
make  them  different  from  one  another.  In  WhatsApp,  the 
users  can  send  text,  pictures,  files  from  Gallery,  pictures 
directly  from  camera,  videos,  audio  directly  from  voice 
recorder like walkie-talkie voice message. WhatsApp enables 
the  user  to  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group  chat  with 
maximum of 100 participants per group. 
 
Other  features  included  in  WhatsApp  chat  sessions  are 
attaching  emoticons,  sending  current  location  and  contact 
details.  WhatsApp  also  shows  the  presence  of  the  users  in 
WhatsApp:  online  and  last  seen  [10]  feature.  The  last  seen 
can  be  configured  to  be  hidden  in  Privacy  settings.  Also, 
every line of messages sent has a tick that indicates different 
meaning. Figure 2 shows three different ticks in WhatsApp: 
single grey tick means that the message is successfully sent; 
double  grey  ticks  mean  that  the  message  has  successfully 
delivered  to  the  recipient’s  phone,  and  the  latest  update 
version  of  WhatsApp,  double  blue  tick  means  that  the 
recipient has read the message. 

 
Figure 2: The different ticks meaning in WhatsApp 

 
In  Telegram,  the  user  can  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group 
chat up to 200 participants per group. The chat overview  is 
similar to WhatsApp. In addition to that, Telegram allows a

2. Mobile Messaging Apps - Features 
 
This  section  will  explain  the  selected  mobile  messaging 
appsused  among  IIUM  students:  WhatsApp,  Telegram, 
WeChat,  Viber,  Line,  KakaoTalk,  and  BBM.  All  are 
available in the market but some similar features. We will be 
discussing  on 
their 
compatibility, registration process, chatting function, price of 
sending  messages,  find  friends  capability,  and  ease  of 
changing  to  new  devices. Most  of  the  features  comparisons 
are discussed for the top three  mobile  messaging apps used 
among  IIUM  students  which  are  WhatsApp,  Telegram,  and 
WeChat. 
 
A. Compatibility 
Table 1 shows the comparison between the compatibility of 
the  mobile  messaging  apps  for  different  operating  system, 
namely 
iOS,  Android,  Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
Symbian, PC, and Web. WhatsApp is compatible with iOS, 
Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PC, and Symbian but 
it  does  not  compatible  with  web.  On  the  other  hand, 
Telegram is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
PC,  and  web  but  it  does  not  support  BlackBerry  and 
Symbian. WeChat is quite similar to WhatsApp and it is also 
compatible  with  web.  Meanwhile,  Viber  is  compatible  with 
all OS and PC. Line is only compatible with iOS, Android, 
Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
and  PC.  KakaoTalk 
compatibility  is  similar  to  Line.  Lastly,  BBM  is  only 
compatible with iOS, Android, and BlackBerry. 
 
B. Registration 
WhatsApp  registration  needs  country  code  and  phone 
number in the device itself. The number needs to be entered 
and WhatsApp will do the verification and the user needs to 
enter their name. As for Telegram, users need to select their 
country and enter the phone number upon registration. After 
that, an activation code from Telegram will be sent through 
SMS.  In  order  to  verify  the  user,  they  need  to  key  in  the 
activation code received. After verification, the user can set 
up a public username [13]. 
 
Meanwhile, in WeChat, the user can sign up with WeChat ID 
(unique name that friends can search) and it can be changed 
only  once  [17].  The  phone  number  will  not  be  shown  in 
WeChat. On  the other  hand, for Viber registration,  the user 
needs to select their country and enter the phone number. The 
phone  number  acts  as  the  ID.  The  registration  process  is 
similar  to  Telegram  as  Viber  will  send  activation  code 
through  SMS.  After  verification,  the  user  can  enter  their 
name.

D. Price 
WhatsApp  is  free  to  download  and  use  for  the  first  year. 
After  one  year  trial,  the  users  have  to  pay  the  subscription 
fees for $0.99 USD or RM 3.50 per year [19]. Figure 6 shows 
that  the  users  may  purchase  the  extension  for  1  year  (RM 
3.50), 3 years (RM 8.75), and 5  years (RM 12.16), and the 
payment can be made through Google Wallet by using debit 
or  credit  card.  On  top  of  that,  the  users  can  pay  for  their 
friends in WhatsApp contact. 

secret chat as shown in Figure 3where the user can send end-
to-end  encrypted  messages  [3]  that  do  not  get  stored  on 
servers and the users are able to set a self-destruction time on 
each individual message for extra privacy where it does not 
supported  by  WhatsApp.  The  padlock  symbol  indicates  the 
private chat. One tick in the message means that the message 
is delivered to the Telegram cloud and the recipient has been 
notified,  while  double  checks  mean  that  the  message  has 
been  read  by  the  recipients  [13].  Telegram  also  allows  the 
users to send photo, video, audio, location, and contact. The 
additional  feature  in  Telegram  for  messaging  is  that  it  can 
send  document  such  as  doc,  zip,  and  mp3  files  while 
WhatsApp cannot. 
 
On the other hand, WeChat has richer emoticons and stickers 
as  compared  to  WhatsApp  and  Telegram.  By  default,  it 
comes  with a default set of animated stickers. The user can 
get more stickers by downloading them for free and some of 
them need to be paid. WeChat allows a chat and a group chat. 
It  enables  users  to  send  images,  videos,  location,  and  name 
card.  Other  feature  of  WeChat  is  walkie-talkie  feature  that 
allows  users  to  send  quick  voice  messages  to  another  user. 
Another distinct feature in the latest version of WeChat 5.0 is 
translation service that can translate the text  messages from 
one  language  to  another  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  This  unique 
feature  is  only  available  in  WeChat  and  none  of  the  other 
mobile messaging apps provide such in-app translation [16]. 
For  translation,  WeChat  supports  up  to  20  international 
languages:  English,  Hindi,  Arabic,  Hebrew,  Indonesian, 
Italian,  Japanese,  Korean,  Malaysia,  Polish,  Russian, 
Spanish,  Thai,  Turkish,  Vietnamese,  French,  Mandarin, 
Portuguese,  Urdu,  and  German  [16].  Moreover,  WeChat 
provides a private group feature to set a password for groups 
where  the  participants  must  enter  a  four-digit  code  before 
starting a conversation in a group as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 6: Payment for subscription fees in WhatsApp 

 
On the other hand, Telegram is an open source app where it 
has  no  subscription  fees  unlike  WhatsApp[15].  WeChat  is 
similar to Telegram as it is also free. However, the payment 
is only applicable for those who want to buy paid stickers. 
 
E. Add Friends 
In WhatsApp, the friend’s phone number must be in the user 
phone’s  contacts  in  order  for  them  to  initiate  a  chat.  Both 
parties  must  get 
installed  beforehand. 
Otherwise,  the  other  party  may  not  find  their  friend  in 
WhatsApp  list  even  though  the  phone  number  is  already  in 
the phone’s contacts. The users might invite their friends who 
do not have WhatsApp installed yet. 
 
Telegram  is  similar  to  WhatsApp  where  the  friend’s  phone 
number  must  be  in  the  user  phone’s  contacts  in  order  for 
them to start a chat and it is required for both parties to install 
Telegram.  The  users  might  invite  their  friends  who  do  not

have Telegram from other apps like WhatsApp. On the other 
hand,  WeChat  provide  few  ways  to  add  friends.  The  users 
might add friends through their phone numbers, find people 
nearby by look around feature, shake feature that enables the 
users  to  shake  their  phones  and  WeChat  will  provide  a 
random  list  of  people  around  them  immediately.  The  users 
can also scan QR code of the friends if there are any, and also 
through WeChat ID. 
 
F. Ease of Changing to New Devices 
WhatsApp  allows  the  users  to  change  phone  numbers  on 
their  accounts.  Hence,  it  is  easy  to  change  to  a  new  device 
since the users need to ensure that particular number of SIM 
card is on the phone that the users wish to register WhatsApp 
on  since  the  verification  during  registration  process  will  be 
done  automatically  and  no  username  or  password  required. 
Meanwhile,  Telegram  requires  the  users  to  deactivate  old 
account and create a new one for the new number if the users 
wish to change for a new device.However, in order to login 
to WeChat account, it requires the users to enter a password 
for the number of the device once the users have logged out. 
 
3. Survey 
 
An  online  survey  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  IIUM 
students’  preferences  on  mobile  messaging  apps  including 
the features and security measures of those mobile messaging 
apps installed in their smartphones. The instrument was a 12 
question mixed response survey created using Google Form. 
The  survey  was  distributed  through  “IIUM  Online”,  the 
Facebook group for IIUM students. The respondents for this 
survey  were  52  students  of  IIUM:  67%  of  them  are  female 
while  another  33%  are  male.  The  first  question  determined 
the type of operating system (OS) used for their smartphones 
and found out that Android is the highest with 81%, followed 
by iOS (13%), and Windows Phone (6%). 
 
To  know  the  most  installed  mobile  messaging  apps,  the 
students  were  asked  on  which  mobile  messaging  apps  that 
they installed in their smartphones. The results are tabulated 
in Table 2. The most installed mobile messaging apps were 
WhatsApp  (98%),  followed  by  Telegram  (46%),  WeChat 
(35%),  Viber  (23%),  Line  (21%),  Others  like  Tango  and 
Badoo (8%), KakaoTalk (6%), and BBM (2%).

Students were then asked on why they installed those mobile 
messaging  apps  and  found  out  that  90%  said  that  it  is  free, 
81% said that everyone is using it, 73% said that it is easy to 
use, 21% for attractive features and remaining 2% for Other 
such as to chat. 
 

To find out the number of mobile messaging apps installed in 
their smartphones, students were asked on how many mobile 
messaging apps that they actively used. Most of them (46%) 
opted for one app. 40% opted for two apps, followed by 8% 
for  three  apps,  and  6%  for  more  than  three  apps.  Students 
were  also  asked  on  how  many  number  of  messages  they 
received  via  those  apps  every  day  and  half  of  them  (54%) 
said that they received more than 50 messages per day. 
 
Due to the ambiguity of defining the features of the mobile 
messaging  apps,  students  were  asked  on  how  many  group 
they  have  in  one  mobile  messaging  app  and  the  highest 
(38%)  have  10  groups,  and  only  one  respondent  (4%)  has 
more  than  40  groups.  Students  were  asked  on  what  group 
they  used  for.  The  results  are  presented  in  a  bar  chart  in 
Figure  7  where  92%  of  them  said  to  socialize,  71%  for 
education, 56% for work, 15% for business, and 8% for other 
such as for trip group. 
 
The  pie  chart  in  Figure  8  shows  the  frequency  use  of 
emoticons represented by  “Always”,  “Often”,  “Sometimes”, 
and  “Never”.  Students  were  asked  on  how  often  they  used 
emoticons  in  the  apps.  The  majority  of  40%  of  them  used 
emoticons  “Always”,  37%  used  emoticons  “Often”,  21% 
used  “Sometimes”,  and  only  one  respondent  (2%)  “Never” 
used emoticons.

To  find  out  the  awareness  of  security  among  the  students, 
they were asked whether they are aware that their messages 
are not well-secured and majority of them (69%) said “Yes” 
while another 31% of them said “No”. They were also asked 
whether  they  have  been  spammed  through  those  mobile 
messaging apps and  majority of them (63%) said  “No” and 
37% said “Yes”. Lastly, they were asked on how they knew 
about  the  mobile  messaging  apps  and  the  answer  included 
“Friends”,  “Advertisements”,  “Google  Play”,  and  “App 
Store”.  Most  of  them  (85%)  said  they  knew  about  it  from 
“Friends”, followed by 42% from “Google Play”, 29% from 
“Advertisements”, and 27% from “App Store”.

4. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
Based on the survey  from 52 students  from IIUM,  majority 
of the students use Android smart phones. This might be due 
to the reasons that the price is cheaper than other OS like iOS 
devices.  Android  devices  are  affordable  for  students  to  buy 
instead of iPhone that  is a bit higher priced and  up  market. 
Moreover,  Android  devices  might  easily  connect  with  one 
another  through  Bluetooth  but  with  iPhone,  they  can  only 
connect  with  iPhone  users.  The  price  of  the  smart  phones 
need to be considered as the users need to think of what data 
plan package that they want to subscribe which also differ in 
price.  By  default,  a  student  will  always  choose  within  their 
limited  budget  for  the  device  and  the  mobile  data  plan  that 
they can afford.  
 
In  terms  of  the  type  of  mobile  messaging  apps  that  the 
students  used,  it  shows  that  WhatsApp  has  the  highest 
percentage  among  others  as  all  of  the  students  installed 
WhatsApp  in  their  phones.  This  is  consistent  to  the 
hypothesis we had. Some of the reasons are due to WhatsApp 
provides the simple features focusing on messaging although 
the users are only given one year of trial and they need to pay 
for  the  subscription  fees  after  one  year.  Moreover,  most  of 
students  said  that  they  knew  about  their  mobile  messaging 
apps through friends rather than from advertisements, Google 
Play  or  App  Store.  WhatsApp  has  never  seen  in  television 
advertisements  but  it  is  widely  used  around  the  world.  As 
compared to the famous apps that are always in the television 
advertisements  such  as  WeChat,  Line,  and  KakaoTalk  with 
famous artists, which are lesser used among students. 
 
It seems like the users do not mind if they have to  subscribe 
WhatsApp as most of the students said that they installed the 
apps because of it is free, everyone is using it, and it is easy 
to use. WhatsApp is well-known mobile messaging app that 
was introduced in 2009 while other apps were only started to 
emerge  after  that.  Therefore,  it  eludes  the  trust  for  the 
students  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  established  app  among 
others. Since everyone is using it, it made the students to feel 
like they must have one. All mobile messaging apps required 
the  users  to  install  them  in  order  to  initiate  chat  with  one 
another. WhatsApp users can only chat with another user that 
have WhatsApp and vice versa. The simple features provided 
in WhatsApp might be the reason why the students said that 
they installed the apps because it is easy to use. There were a 
small  percentage  of  the  students  said  that  they  installed  the 
apps due to its attractive features which means that simplicity 
is the key. Users do not prefer those apps with rich features 
and WhatsApp is the right one although it does not provide 
secret  chat  as  in  Telegram  and  cool  stickers  as  in  WeChat. 
Moreover,  majority  of  the  students  used  emoticons  while 
messaging  even  though  emoticons  are  not  that  cool  as 
stickers but it simply shows one’s emotion instead of texting.  
 
About  half  of  the  students  said  that  they  have  one  mobile 
messaging app that is actively used. It can be concluded that 
WhatsApp  is  the  most  favourable  mobile  messaging  app 
among IIUM students since all of the students in the survey 
installed  WhatsApp  in  their  phones.  Most  of  the  students 
have more than 5 groups in the app and the groups are used 
the  most  for  socializing  and  educational  purposes.  It  is  a 
nature for the mobile users to use them to interact with their 

friends  and  family,  and  that  is  the  main  purpose  of  why 
mobile messaging apps are created. Besides, students need to 
discuss  on  their  academic  outside  of  the  classrooms  and 
sometimes,  they  might  have  no  time  to  meet  up  for  group 
discussion.  Alternatively,  mobile  messaging apps  help them 
to  communicate  without  having  to  meet  face-to-face.  They 
can discuss on their class materials and what not in the app 
anytime  and  less  energy  is  needed  as  they  do  not  have  to 
meet up somewhere and only discuss through the apps. 
 
In terms of security concern, most of the students are aware 
that their messages are not well-secured. According to Thijs 
Alkemade, an open-source developer and student at Utrecht 
University  in  the  Netherlands  [20],  he  explored  the  flaw  in 
the app’s encryption that would make it possible to read plain 
text  sent  through  WhatsApp.  The  vulnerability  has  been 
found in most Android devices and Nokia Series. However, 
there is a possibility that the vulnerability could be found in 
iOS  devices  as  well  [20].  WhatsApp  messages  are  most 
likely have been compromised if the users are using unsecure 
wireless networks. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid sharing 
personal  information  like  home  address  or  unsafe  photos 
through  any  mobile  messaging  app  even  though  security  is 
provided.  All  in  all,  users  have  to  limit  their  personal 
information sharing while using any mobile messaging app in 
order to avoid from such security issues. 
 
Another  security  concern  regarding  spam,  majority  of 
students  said  that  they  have  not  been  spammed  through  the 
mobile  messaging  apps.  This  result  shows  that  mobile 
messaging  apps  are  different  than  SMS  since  SMS  spam 
(also  called  as  mobile  spamming,  text  spam,  and  m-spam) 
[11] occur through SMS itself. The SMS spam occurs when 
unwanted  advertisements  are  sent  through  text  messaging. 
The spammers might easily get the users’ phone numbers and 
start  sending  spam  through  SMS.  Meanwhile  in  mobile 
messaging apps, the users can only start to chat if both parties 
get the app installed and have each other phone numbers in 
phone’s contact list. Perhaps, it will be more difficult for the 
spammers  to  send  the  unwanted  messages  but  it  has  high 
possibility to happen in WhatsApp since mostly everyone has 
WhatsApp installed in their phones. 
 
In a nutshell, it is clearly proved that WhatsApp is the most 
favourable mobile messaging app among IIUM students due 
to its simple features that make it easy to use due to the fact 
that  everyone  is  using  it.  The  most  important  thing  for  the 
user is that the functionality to quickly send messages to their 
friends  and  family  no  matter  where  they  are  without 
bothering  too  much  with  cool  features  such  as  stickers  that 
provided  by  the  other  apps.  Telegram  is  also  one  of  the 
mostly used by IIUM students since it is in top two installed 
mobile  messaging  app  based  the  survey.  The  similar  chat 
overview and features to WhatsApp might be the reasons as 
to why Telegram is in top two installed. Additional features 
of  Telegram  such  as  secret  chat  and  it  is  completely  free 
service  would  make  Telegram  more  preferable  in  future. 
However, WeChat provide cute stickers and it is suitable for 
youngsters who love to send cool stickers even though some 
of  them  need  to  be  purchased.  As  a  student,  mobile 
messaging apps are indeed needed in daily lives in order to 
communicate  with  each  other  for  free  or  at  lower  cost  than 
SMS, as long as they have an internet connection.

Abstract: Mobile messaging applications is rapid adopted globally. They allow mobile users to send messages to individuals or groups 
for very minimal fee, even some are totally free as long as the smartphones are connected to internet. WhatsApp is one of the top mobile 
messaging applications among a handful number of applications that have entered the market. The goal of this paper is to investigate 
the most favourable mobile messaging apps among IIUM students and to provide a feature comparison between a few selected mobile 
messaging applications. Despite the obvious of being a free application, this paper intends to investigate the other factors causing the 
widespread adoption of this mobile application especially among students. An online survey was distributed to 52 students from IIUM by 
using Google Docs to validate which mobile messaging applications are mostly used. 
 
Keywords: Mobile messaging apps, mobile instant messaging, smartphones, SMS, WhatsApp, features, IIUM 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Mobile  messaging  applications  is  not  a  new  technology.  It 
has been widely used ever since the mobile phone technology 
takes over the telecommunication industry across the world. 
Traditionally,  SMS  or  Short  Messaging  Service  was  first 
introduced in 1991 to send and receive short text messages to 
and 
is  a  mass 
communications  medium  used  by  billions  of  people  around 
the world ever since. Within just a short span of ten years, a 
new medium - mobile messaging application has taken over 
the  SMS  popularity  [7].  Some  of  these  mobile  messaging 
apps  are  WhatsApp  (2009),  Line  (2011),  WeChat  (2011), 
KakaoTalk (2010), Viber (2010), Telegram (2013), and BBM 
(2009). These applications allow the users to send real-time 
text  messages to individuals  or groups of  friends at  no cost 
[8].  The  evolution  of  smart  phones  in  the  market  together 
with  good  package  of  mobile  data  plans  are  naturally  the 
simplest  reason  why  the  trend  has  shift  from  using  SMS  to 
mobile messaging apps.  
 
Going  back  in  time,  SMS  is  built  into  the  GSM  wireless 
standard which allows 160 character text messages to be sent 
to  and  from  any  GSM  mobile  phones,  regardless  of  the 
service providers they are belongs to. The technology further 
evolved to Multimedia Service or MMS, where image, video, 
and sound can be added into the text messages [8].  
 
The basic requirement of a message remains the same when 
smart phones comes into the picture. Users still need to send 
and  receive  images,  videos  and  audios.  On  top  of  that,  the 
trend  has  now  included  location-based  messages  with  the 
addition of GPS as a basic feature in  most smart phones. It 
becomes  a  norm  to  send  messages  to  individual  friend  or 
group  of  friends  without  the  need  to  type  the  details  of 
locations, describing the  meeting place, or trying to explain 
the  songs  that  one  hears.  Furthermore,  it  is  now  free  of 
charge  as  long  as 
the  mobile  data  plan  or  wireless 
connections  are  active.  The  focus  of  this  paper  discussion 
will be on WhatsApp Messenger, which was first introduced 
to  the  market  in  2009  by  Brian  Acton  and  Jan  Koum,  both 
are former employees of Yahoo [18]. It is then taken over by 

Facebook  on  February  19,  2014  [18].  After  WhatsApp  was 
first  introduced  to  the  market,  a  lot  of  other  similar  mobile 
messaging  apps  have  been  emerged  and  continuously 
evolved  [4].  Different  mobile  messaging  apps  provide 
different features.  
 
There was a survey done in Utah State University about their 
use  of  mobile  devices  for  academic  purposes.  It  was  found 
that 54 % of undergraduate students use  mobile devices for 
academic  purposes  [6].  In  another  study,  the  use  of  text 
messaging 
that 
students are positive about using mobile devices in education 
[12]. This leads to the same conclusion for mobile messaging 
apps. 
 
The  use  of  mobile  messaging  apps  among  students  in 
educational  context  is  as  pervasive  as  for  socializing, 
business, and working purposes. These general observations 
and  assumption  on  the  usefulness  of  mobile  messaging 
application in the education sector has led to this paper where 
it  focuses  on  assessing  IIUM  students’  preferences  towards 
which mobile messaging apps. IIUM or International Islamic 
University  Malaysia  is  a  government  institution  for  higher 
education in Malaysia. The students originate from more than 
100 countries representing nearly all regions of the world [1]. 
 
The focus is on WhatsApp Messenger as it is considered to 
be  the  top  among  the  other  mobile  messaging  apps.  Our 
hypothesis 
installed 
WhatsApp Messenger. To validate this assumption, a survey 
has been done to know their preferences of mobile messaging 
apps  including  the  features  and  security  measures  of  those 
mobile  messaging  apps  installed  in  their  smart  phones.  The 
survey  result  shows  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  installed 
among  the  students  as  shown  in  Figure1  where  98%  of 
students are using WhatsApp as their mobile messaging app. 
This  validated  our  hypothesis.  The  detailed  survey  results 
will be discussed in Section 3.

that  almost  all  IIUM  students

Similarly for Line, the user needs to select their country and 
enter phone number. After that, a verification code that will 
automatically register the account will be sent through SMS 
same as Telegram and Viber. For KakaoTalk, the user only 
needs to enter phone number without registering or logging-
in [2]. The verification code will be sent to the phone and it 
will automatically verify and provide a Talk ID that can be 
used for friends to add in KakaoTalk. In order to use BBM, 
the  user  needs  a  BBID  (BlackBerry  ID).  After  installing 
BBM on  the  device,  the  users  can  create  a  BBID  using  the 
smartphone  and  also  through  online  on  bbid.com.  After 
creating BBID, the  user needs to sign  in  to BBM using  the 
created BBID [5].

C. Chat 
The main feature for a mobile messaging app that one would 
expect is the ability to chat or have a conversation by sending 
unlimited number of messages to individuals and groups in a 
fast-pace  and  conversation-like  style.  Different  mobile 
messaging apps in the market provide their own features that 
make  them  different  from  one  another.  In  WhatsApp,  the 
users  can  send  text,  pictures,  files  from  Gallery,  pictures 
directly  from  camera,  videos,  audio  directly  from  voice 
recorder like walkie-talkie voice message. WhatsApp enables 
the  user  to  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group  chat  with 
maximum of 100 participants per group. 
 
Other  features  included  in  WhatsApp  chat  sessions  are 
attaching  emoticons,  sending  current  location  and  contact 
details.  WhatsApp  also  shows  the  presence  of  the  users  in 
WhatsApp:  online  and  last  seen  [10]  feature.  The  last  seen 
can  be  configured  to  be  hidden  in  Privacy  settings.  Also, 
every line of messages sent has a tick that indicates different 
meaning. Figure 2 shows three different ticks in WhatsApp: 
single grey tick means that the message is successfully sent; 
double  grey  ticks  mean  that  the  message  has  successfully 
delivered  to  the  recipient’s  phone,  and  the  latest  update 
version  of  WhatsApp,  double  blue  tick  means  that  the 
recipient has read the message.

In  Telegram,  the  user  can  create  a  chat  as  well  as  a  group 
chat up to 200 participants per group. The chat overview  is 
similar to WhatsApp. In addition to that, Telegram allows a

2. Mobile Messaging Apps - Features 
 
This  section  will  explain  the  selected  mobile  messaging 
appsused  among  IIUM  students:  WhatsApp,  Telegram, 
WeChat,  Viber,  Line,  KakaoTalk,  and  BBM.  All  are 
available in the market but some similar features. We will be 
discussing  on 
their 
compatibility, registration process, chatting function, price of 
sending  messages,  find  friends  capability,  and  ease  of 
changing  to  new  devices. Most  of  the  features  comparisons 
are discussed for the top three  mobile  messaging apps used 
among  IIUM  students  which  are  WhatsApp,  Telegram,  and 
WeChat. 
 
A. Compatibility 
Table 1 shows the comparison between the compatibility of 
the  mobile  messaging  apps  for  different  operating  system, 
namely 
iOS,  Android,  Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
Symbian, PC, and Web. WhatsApp is compatible with iOS, 
Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PC, and Symbian but 
it  does  not  compatible  with  web.  On  the  other  hand, 
Telegram is compatible with iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
PC,  and  web  but  it  does  not  support  BlackBerry  and 
Symbian. WeChat is quite similar to WhatsApp and it is also 
compatible  with  web.  Meanwhile,  Viber  is  compatible  with 
all OS and PC. Line is only compatible with iOS, Android, 
Windows  Phone,  BlackBerry, 
and  PC.  KakaoTalk 
compatibility  is  similar  to  Line.  Lastly,  BBM  is  only 
compatible with iOS, Android, and BlackBerry. 
 
B. Registration 
WhatsApp  registration  needs  country  code  and  phone 
number in the device itself. The number needs to be entered 
and WhatsApp will do the verification and the user needs to 
enter their name. As for Telegram, users need to select their 
country and enter the phone number upon registration. After 
that, an activation code from Telegram will be sent through 
SMS.  In  order  to  verify  the  user,  they  need  to  key  in  the 
activation code received. After verification, the user can set 
up a public username [13]. 
 
Meanwhile, in WeChat, the user can sign up with WeChat ID 
(unique name that friends can search) and it can be changed 
only  once  [17].  The  phone  number  will  not  be  shown  in 
WeChat. On  the other  hand, for Viber registration,  the user 
needs to select their country and enter the phone number. The 
phone  number  acts  as  the  ID.  The  registration  process  is 
similar  to  Telegram  as  Viber  will  send  activation  code 
through  SMS.  After  verification,  the  user  can  enter  their 
name.

D. Price 
WhatsApp  is  free  to  download  and  use  for  the  first  year. 
After  one  year  trial,  the  users  have  to  pay  the  subscription 
fees for $0.99 USD or RM 3.50 per year [19]. Figure 6 shows 
that  the  users  may  purchase  the  extension  for  1  year  (RM 
3.50), 3 years (RM 8.75), and 5  years (RM 12.16), and the 
payment can be made through Google Wallet by using debit 
or  credit  card.  On  top  of  that,  the  users  can  pay  for  their 
friends in WhatsApp contact. 

secret chat as shown in Figure 3where the user can send end-
to-end  encrypted  messages  [3]  that  do  not  get  stored  on 
servers and the users are able to set a self-destruction time on 
each individual message for extra privacy where it does not 
supported  by  WhatsApp.  The  padlock  symbol  indicates  the 
private chat. One tick in the message means that the message 
is delivered to the Telegram cloud and the recipient has been 
notified,  while  double  checks  mean  that  the  message  has 
been  read  by  the  recipients  [13].  Telegram  also  allows  the 
users to send photo, video, audio, location, and contact. The 
additional  feature  in  Telegram  for  messaging  is  that  it  can 
send  document  such  as  doc,  zip,  and  mp3  files  while 
WhatsApp cannot. 
 
On the other hand, WeChat has richer emoticons and stickers 
as  compared  to  WhatsApp  and  Telegram.  By  default,  it 
comes  with a default set of animated stickers. The user can 
get more stickers by downloading them for free and some of 
them need to be paid. WeChat allows a chat and a group chat. 
It  enables  users  to  send  images,  videos,  location,  and  name 
card.  Other  feature  of  WeChat  is  walkie-talkie  feature  that 
allows  users  to  send  quick  voice  messages  to  another  user. 
Another distinct feature in the latest version of WeChat 5.0 is 
translation service that can translate the text  messages from 
one  language  to  another  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  This  unique 
feature  is  only  available  in  WeChat  and  none  of  the  other 
mobile messaging apps provide such in-app translation [16]. 
For  translation,  WeChat  supports  up  to  20  international 
languages:  English,  Hindi,  Arabic,  Hebrew,  Indonesian, 
Italian,  Japanese,  Korean,  Malaysia,  Polish,  Russian, 
Spanish,  Thai,  Turkish,  Vietnamese,  French,  Mandarin, 
Portuguese,  Urdu,  and  German  [16].  Moreover,  WeChat 
provides a private group feature to set a password for groups 
where  the  participants  must  enter  a  four-digit  code  before 
starting a conversation in a group as shown in Figure 5. 
 

Figure 3: Telegram chat overview for secret chat 

 

 

 

Figure 6: Payment for subscription fees in WhatsApp 

 
On the other hand, Telegram is an open source app where it 
has  no  subscription  fees  unlike  WhatsApp[15].  WeChat  is 
similar to Telegram as it is also free. However, the payment 
is only applicable for those who want to buy paid stickers. 
 
E. Add Friends 
In WhatsApp, the friend’s phone number must be in the user 
phone’s  contacts  in  order  for  them  to  initiate  a  chat.  Both 
parties  must  get 
installed  beforehand. 
Otherwise,  the  other  party  may  not  find  their  friend  in 
WhatsApp  list  even  though  the  phone  number  is  already  in 
the phone’s contacts. The users might invite their friends who 
do not have WhatsApp installed yet. 
 
Telegram  is  similar  to  WhatsApp  where  the  friend’s  phone 
number  must  be  in  the  user  phone’s  contacts  in  order  for 
them to start a chat and it is required for both parties to install 
Telegram.  The  users  might  invite  their  friends  who  do  not

have Telegram from other apps like WhatsApp. On the other 
hand,  WeChat  provide  few  ways  to  add  friends.  The  users 
might add friends through their phone numbers, find people 
nearby by look around feature, shake feature that enables the 
users  to  shake  their  phones  and  WeChat  will  provide  a 
random  list  of  people  around  them  immediately.  The  users 
can also scan QR code of the friends if there are any, and also 
through WeChat ID. 
 
F. Ease of Changing to New Devices 
WhatsApp  allows  the  users  to  change  phone  numbers  on 
their  accounts.  Hence,  it  is  easy  to  change  to  a  new  device 
since the users need to ensure that particular number of SIM 
card is on the phone that the users wish to register WhatsApp 
on  since  the  verification  during  registration  process  will  be 
done  automatically  and  no  username  or  password  required. 
Meanwhile,  Telegram  requires  the  users  to  deactivate  old 
account and create a new one for the new number if the users 
wish to change for a new device.However, in order to login 
to WeChat account, it requires the users to enter a password 
for the number of the device once the users have logged out. 
 
3. Survey 
 
An  online  survey  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  IIUM 
students’  preferences  on  mobile  messaging  apps  including 
the features and security measures of those mobile messaging 
apps installed in their smartphones. The instrument was a 12 
question mixed response survey created using Google Form. 
The  survey  was  distributed  through  “IIUM  Online”,  the 
Facebook group for IIUM students. The respondents for this 
survey  were  52  students  of  IIUM:  67%  of  them  are  female 
while  another  33%  are  male.  The  first  question  determined 
the type of operating system (OS) used for their smartphones 
and found out that Android is the highest with 81%, followed 
by iOS (13%), and Windows Phone (6%). 
 
To  know  the  most  installed  mobile  messaging  apps,  the 
students  were  asked  on  which  mobile  messaging  apps  that 
they installed in their smartphones. The results are tabulated 
in Table 2. The most installed mobile messaging apps were 
WhatsApp  (98%),  followed  by  Telegram  (46%),  WeChat 
(35%),  Viber  (23%),  Line  (21%),  Others  like  Tango  and 
Badoo (8%), KakaoTalk (6%), and BBM (2%).

Students were then asked on why they installed those mobile 
messaging  apps  and  found  out  that  90%  said  that  it  is  free, 
81% said that everyone is using it, 73% said that it is easy to 
use, 21% for attractive features and remaining 2% for Other 
such as to chat. 
 

To find out the number of mobile messaging apps installed in 
their smartphones, students were asked on how many mobile 
messaging apps that they actively used. Most of them (46%) 
opted for one app. 40% opted for two apps, followed by 8% 
for  three  apps,  and  6%  for  more  than  three  apps.  Students 
were  also  asked  on  how  many  number  of  messages  they 
received  via  those  apps  every  day  and  half  of  them  (54%) 
said that they received more than 50 messages per day. 
 
Due to the ambiguity of defining the features of the mobile 
messaging  apps,  students  were  asked  on  how  many  group 
they  have  in  one  mobile  messaging  app  and  the  highest 
(38%)  have  10  groups,  and  only  one  respondent  (4%)  has 
more  than  40  groups.  Students  were  asked  on  what  group 
they  used  for.  The  results  are  presented  in  a  bar  chart  in 
Figure  7  where  92%  of  them  said  to  socialize,  71%  for 
education, 56% for work, 15% for business, and 8% for other 
such as for trip group. 
 
The  pie  chart  in  Figure  8  shows  the  frequency  use  of 
emoticons represented by  “Always”,  “Often”,  “Sometimes”, 
and  “Never”.  Students  were  asked  on  how  often  they  used 
emoticons  in  the  apps.  The  majority  of  40%  of  them  used 
emoticons  “Always”,  37%  used  emoticons  “Often”,  21% 
used  “Sometimes”,  and  only  one  respondent  (2%)  “Never” 
used emoticons.

To  find  out  the  awareness  of  security  among  the  students, 
they were asked whether they are aware that their messages 
are not well-secured and majority of them (69%) said “Yes” 
while another 31% of them said “No”. They were also asked 
whether  they  have  been  spammed  through  those  mobile 
messaging apps and  majority of them (63%) said  “No” and 
37% said “Yes”. Lastly, they were asked on how they knew 
about  the  mobile  messaging  apps  and  the  answer  included 
“Friends”,  “Advertisements”,  “Google  Play”,  and  “App 
Store”.  Most  of  them  (85%)  said  they  knew  about  it  from 
“Friends”, followed by 42% from “Google Play”, 29% from 
“Advertisements”, and 27% from “App Store”.

4. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
Based on the survey  from 52 students  from IIUM,  majority 
of the students use Android smart phones. This might be due 
to the reasons that the price is cheaper than other OS like iOS 
devices.  Android  devices  are  affordable  for  students  to  buy 
instead of iPhone that  is a bit higher priced and  up  market. 
Moreover,  Android  devices  might  easily  connect  with  one 
another  through  Bluetooth  but  with  iPhone,  they  can  only 
connect  with  iPhone  users.  The  price  of  the  smart  phones 
need to be considered as the users need to think of what data 
plan package that they want to subscribe which also differ in 
price.  By  default,  a  student  will  always  choose  within  their 
limited  budget  for  the  device  and  the  mobile  data  plan  that 
they can afford.  
 
In  terms  of  the  type  of  mobile  messaging  apps  that  the 
students  used,  it  shows  that  WhatsApp  has  the  highest 
percentage  among  others  as  all  of  the  students  installed 
WhatsApp  in  their  phones.  This  is  consistent  to  the 
hypothesis we had. Some of the reasons are due to WhatsApp 
provides the simple features focusing on messaging although 
the users are only given one year of trial and they need to pay 
for  the  subscription  fees  after  one  year.  Moreover,  most  of 
students  said  that  they  knew  about  their  mobile  messaging 
apps through friends rather than from advertisements, Google 
Play  or  App  Store.  WhatsApp  has  never  seen  in  television 
advertisements  but  it  is  widely  used  around  the  world.  As 
compared to the famous apps that are always in the television 
advertisements  such  as  WeChat,  Line,  and  KakaoTalk  with 
famous artists, which are lesser used among students. 
 
It seems like the users do not mind if they have to  subscribe 
WhatsApp as most of the students said that they installed the 
apps because of it is free, everyone is using it, and it is easy 
to use. WhatsApp is well-known mobile messaging app that 
was introduced in 2009 while other apps were only started to 
emerge  after  that.  Therefore,  it  eludes  the  trust  for  the 
students  that  WhatsApp  is  the  most  established  app  among 
others. Since everyone is using it, it made the students to feel 
like they must have one. All mobile messaging apps required 
the  users  to  install  them  in  order  to  initiate  chat  with  one 
another. WhatsApp users can only chat with another user that 
have WhatsApp and vice versa. The simple features provided 
in WhatsApp might be the reason why the students said that 
they installed the apps because it is easy to use. There were a 
small  percentage  of  the  students  said  that  they  installed  the 
apps due to its attractive features which means that simplicity 
is the key. Users do not prefer those apps with rich features 
and WhatsApp is the right one although it does not provide 
secret  chat  as  in  Telegram  and  cool  stickers  as  in  WeChat. 
Moreover,  majority  of  the  students  used  emoticons  while 
messaging  even  though  emoticons  are  not  that  cool  as 
stickers but it simply shows one’s emotion instead of texting.  
 
About  half  of  the  students  said  that  they  have  one  mobile 
messaging app that is actively used. It can be concluded that 
WhatsApp  is  the  most  favourable  mobile  messaging  app 
among IIUM students since all of the students in the survey 
installed  WhatsApp  in  their  phones.  Most  of  the  students 
have more than 5 groups in the app and the groups are used 
the  most  for  socializing  and  educational  purposes.  It  is  a 
nature for the mobile users to use them to interact with their 

friends  and  family,  and  that  is  the  main  purpose  of  why 
mobile messaging apps are created. Besides, students need to 
discuss  on  their  academic  outside  of  the  classrooms  and 
sometimes,  they  might  have  no  time  to  meet  up  for  group 
discussion.  Alternatively,  mobile  messaging apps  help them 
to  communicate  without  having  to  meet  face-to-face.  They 
can discuss on their class materials and what not in the app 
anytime  and  less  energy  is  needed  as  they  do  not  have  to 
meet up somewhere and only discuss through the apps. 
 
In terms of security concern, most of the students are aware 
that their messages are not well-secured. According to Thijs 
Alkemade, an open-source developer and student at Utrecht 
University  in  the  Netherlands  [20],  he  explored  the  flaw  in 
the app’s encryption that would make it possible to read plain 
text  sent  through  WhatsApp.  The  vulnerability  has  been 
found in most Android devices and Nokia Series. However, 
there is a possibility that the vulnerability could be found in 
iOS  devices  as  well  [20].  WhatsApp  messages  are  most 
likely have been compromised if the users are using unsecure 
wireless networks. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid sharing 
personal  information  like  home  address  or  unsafe  photos 
through  any  mobile  messaging  app  even  though  security  is 
provided.  All  in  all,  users  have  to  limit  their  personal 
information sharing while using any mobile messaging app in 
order to avoid from such security issues. 
 
Another  security  concern  regarding  spam,  majority  of 
students  said  that  they  have  not  been  spammed  through  the 
mobile  messaging  apps.  This  result  shows  that  mobile 
messaging  apps  are  different  than  SMS  since  SMS  spam 
(also  called  as  mobile  spamming,  text  spam,  and  m-spam) 
[11] occur through SMS itself. The SMS spam occurs when 
unwanted  advertisements  are  sent  through  text  messaging. 
The spammers might easily get the users’ phone numbers and 
start  sending  spam  through  SMS.  Meanwhile  in  mobile 
messaging apps, the users can only start to chat if both parties 
get the app installed and have each other phone numbers in 
phone’s contact list. Perhaps, it will be more difficult for the 
spammers  to  send  the  unwanted  messages  but  it  has  high 
possibility to happen in WhatsApp since mostly everyone has 
WhatsApp installed in their phones. 
 
In a nutshell, it is clearly proved that WhatsApp is the most 
favourable mobile messaging app among IIUM students due 
to its simple features that make it easy to use due to the fact 
that  everyone  is  using  it.  The  most  important  thing  for  the 
user is that the functionality to quickly send messages to their 
friends  and  family  no  matter  where  they  are  without 
bothering  too  much  with  cool  features  such  as  stickers  that 
provided  by  the  other  apps.  Telegram  is  also  one  of  the 
mostly used by IIUM students since it is in top two installed 
mobile  messaging  app  based  the  survey.  The  similar  chat 
overview and features to WhatsApp might be the reasons as 
to why Telegram is in top two installed. Additional features 
of  Telegram  such  as  secret  chat  and  it  is  completely  free 
service  would  make  Telegram  more  preferable  in  future. 
However, WeChat provide cute stickers and it is suitable for 
youngsters who love to send cool stickers even though some 
of  them  need  to  be  purchased.  As  a  student,  mobile 
messaging apps are indeed needed in daily lives in order to 
communicate  with  each  other  for  free  or  at  lower  cost  than 
SMS, as long as they have an internet connection.

There  are  some  limitations  for  this  study  due  to  the  small 
number of respondents  who  were only  from one  university. 
Therefore, to get more accurate results, the study should have 
involved more respondents from other universities in future. 
Besides that, the research instrument for this study is limited 
to  survey.  In  further  study,  the  study  should  have  a 
triangulation  for  better  findings  which  include  survey, 
interview, and observation.
