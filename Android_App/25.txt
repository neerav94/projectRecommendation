The world is ever changing due to the advancement technology in every sphere of life. In today‟s hitech world its very 
hard  to  escape  the  presence  of  technology  especially  the  one  available  on  mobile.  Many  of  us  depend  on  it  to  a  great 
extent to do our job to get around and to find certain things and what most people did not even though of few years back, 
is now becoming a reality. 
Online Chap app is one of the changes in technology which is commonly used on specific mobile phones and computers. 
As  the  Smart  Phones  became  popular,  many  messaging  services  were  launched  like  whats  app,  hike,  we  chat,  fb 
messenger etc. All these services are free or a very nominal small amount is charged on year basis. All the online chats 
are highly addictive and affect to a great extent on regular users, the repercussion of which is difficult to control and cure 
especially when the users are happen to be students. 
Internet usage continues to grow at an incredible speed. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection 
today.  In  1995,  it  was  less  than  1%.  The  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  tenfold  from  1999  to  2013.  The first

mark  by  December  2014  according  to  „Internet  in  India  2014‟  report  jointly  published  by  the Internet  and  Mobile 
Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International. The year on year growth rate registered stands at impressive 32 
percent. The acceleration of internet growth in India can be gauged from the fact that India took 10 years to move from 
10 to 100 million. It took 3 years to move from 100 to 200 million , whereas the next 100 million (from 200 to 300M) 
milestone was achieved in just 1 year. Even if the same growth is maintained, India will reach 500 million users before 
end of 2016. 
The  report  states  that  the healthy  growth  in  internet  users  has  been  driven  by  rural  Indians who  are  now  increasingly 
accessing internet either on their mobile phones or computers. Rural India registered a growth rate of 39 percent to reach 
101 million users by October 2014, whereas urban India grew by 29 percent to reach 177 million by October 2014. By 
end of December 2014, Urban India will have 190 million internet users (63%), while rural India will have 112 million 
(37%). 
With this rampant use of internet on mobile phones students are the most effected among all as they are in their period of 
learning  and  their  interest  on  Friendship  Social  Interaction,  Personal  Relationship,  Physical  Fitness,  Mental  Fitness,

messenger service WhatsApp's user base in India has grown to 70 million active users, which is over a tenth of its global 
users, its business head Neeraj Arora has said. 
"We  have  70  million  active  users  here  who  use  the  application  at  least  once  a  month,"  Arora,  a  vice-president  with 
WhatsApp, said at the fifth annual INK Conference. He said the total user base for the company, which was bought by 
Facebook in a blockbuster $19 billion deal earlier this year, is 600 million.” 
Whats app and other messenger has  been around for a  while but recent updates have improved the functionality of the 
application. The main objective behind this app is to replace SMS with a cross platform mobile messenger that works on 
an  internet  data  plan  with  many  other  advantages  which  is  not  available  on  normal  texting  like  Unlimited  text,  image, 
audio and video sharing etc. Now Whats app has introduced the calling services also. It is currently available for iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 and S40 and Blackberry.  
All  those  apps  brings  us  so  many  benefits,  it  has  also  got  it  flaws  that  are  causing  more  harm  than  good  among  the 
students today. Hence, taking cognizance of the rate at which our youth at various Technical Institutions are hooking up 
to social media, there is dire urgency that first it effects on students various aspects should be studied and second some 
good corrective and preventive measures to be taken in this direction.

III.       LITERATURE REVIEW 

Introduction 
Literature  review  for  this  paper  was  covered  on  Social  Media  and  students  performance.  Social  media  has  become  a 
growing phenomenon with many and varied definitions in public and academic use. Any activities where humans share 
stories  and  influence  others  can  be  considered  social  networking  Nicholson,  (2011).  Social  networking  or  media  is  a 
great  forum  for  discussing  mutual  topics  of  interest,  and  perhaps  even  meeting  or  renewing  acquaintances  with  other 
humans virtually. According to Greenwald (2009) and Deloitte (2009), 55% of employees visit a social media site at least 
once a week. 
 

Students and use of Social Networking Sites 
Students are increasingly utilizing these social networks for friends‟ news feeds, personal updates, events and activities, 
notes, and messages. According to an extensive study by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) of the United Kingdom, 
almost half (49%) of children aged 8-17 who used the Internet had set up their own profiles on a social networking site 
Ofcom,  (2008a);  Dowdall,  (2009).  Positive  perceptions  obtained  from  users  of  social  networking  sites  i.e.  effective 
learning which has resulted in an easy learning climate among students Mazer, et al., (2010). In another study conducted 
by  Keenan  and  Shirii,  (2009)  they  explored  how  social  networking  sites  encourage  friendliness  through  the  use  of 
Facebook,  Twitter  and  LinkedIn.  The  study  concluded  that  numerous  approaches  can  be  used  to  encourage  amiability 
among students which leads to a positive effect from SNSs user‟s point of view. In a study conducted by Mazer et al., 
(2007) concluded that Facebook networking site is used by students more frequently and also faculty members. Recent 
data obtained from Facebook through their spokesperson, showed that approximately 297,000 users are university faculty 
members, although there are pros and cons in each case. 
While the researcher agree on both negative and positive impact of social media and academic performance, our aim was 
to broaden the scope of thinking of decision makers to reflect on the realities and to create and maintain a system that can 
change  students‟  attitude  that  will  promote  quality  image  and  improve  upon  performance.  After  a  critical  review  of 
various literatures on social media, the researchers could identify that there are gaps in knowledge as far as the negative 
effect of the use of  “Whatsapp” and students performance especially in Engineering Institutes of Nagpur City, and that 
merits a closer investigation.

2005.  The 

 second 

The world is ever changing due to the advancement technology in every sphere of life. In today‟s hitech world its very 
hard  to  escape  the  presence  of  technology  especially  the  one  available  on  mobile.  Many  of  us  depend  on  it  to  a  great 
extent to do our job to get around and to find certain things and what most people did not even though of few years back, 
is now becoming a reality. 
Online Chap app is one of the changes in technology which is commonly used on specific mobile phones and computers. 
As  the  Smart  Phones  became  popular,  many  messaging  services  were  launched  like  whats  app,  hike,  we  chat,  fb 
messenger etc. All these services are free or a very nominal small amount is charged on year basis. All the online chats 
are highly addictive and affect to a great extent on regular users, the repercussion of which is difficult to control and cure 
especially when the users are happen to be students. 
Internet usage continues to grow at an incredible speed. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection 
today.  In  1995,  it  was  less  than  1%.  The  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  tenfold  from  1999  to  2013.  The first 
(Ref: 
billion was 
http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/). 
by 
(http://trak.in/tags/business/2014/11/19/india-300m-internet-users-2014/)  Internet  Users  in  India  will  cross  300  million 
mark  by  December  2014  according  to  „Internet  in  India  2014‟  report  jointly  published  by  the Internet  and  Mobile 
Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International. The year on year growth rate registered stands at impressive 32 
percent. The acceleration of internet growth in India can be gauged from the fact that India took 10 years to move from 
10 to 100 million. It took 3 years to move from 100 to 200 million , whereas the next 100 million (from 200 to 300M) 
milestone was achieved in just 1 year. Even if the same growth is maintained, India will reach 500 million users before 
end of 2016. 
The  report  states  that  the healthy  growth  in  internet  users  has  been  driven  by  rural  Indians who  are  now  increasingly 
accessing internet either on their mobile phones or computers. Rural India registered a growth rate of 39 percent to reach 
101 million users by October 2014, whereas urban India grew by 29 percent to reach 177 million by October 2014. By 
end of December 2014, Urban India will have 190 million internet users (63%), while rural India will have 112 million 
(37%). 
With this rampant use of internet on mobile phones students are the most effected among all as they are in their period of 
learning  and  their  interest  on  Friendship  Social  Interaction,  Personal  Relationship,  Physical  Fitness,  Mental  Fitness, 
Academics  and  Ethical  Behaviour.  As  per  the  news  published  in  the  The  Times  of  India  on  Nov  3,  2014,  “  Mobile

messenger service WhatsApp's user base in India has grown to 70 million active users, which is over a tenth of its global 
users, its business head Neeraj Arora has said. 
"We  have  70  million  active  users  here  who  use  the  application  at  least  once  a  month,"  Arora,  a  vice-president  with 
WhatsApp, said at the fifth annual INK Conference. He said the total user base for the company, which was bought by 
Facebook in a blockbuster $19 billion deal earlier this year, is 600 million.” 
Whats app and other messenger has  been around for a  while but recent updates have improved the functionality of the 
application. The main objective behind this app is to replace SMS with a cross platform mobile messenger that works on 
an  internet  data  plan  with  many  other  advantages  which  is  not  available  on  normal  texting  like  Unlimited  text,  image, 
audio and video sharing etc. Now Whats app has introduced the calling services also. It is currently available for iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 and S40 and Blackberry.  
All  those  apps  brings  us  so  many  benefits,  it  has  also  got  it  flaws  that  are  causing  more  harm  than  good  among  the 
students today. Hence, taking cognizance of the rate at which our youth at various Technical Institutions are hooking up 
to social media, there is dire urgency that first it effects on students various aspects should be studied and second some 
good corrective and preventive measures to be taken in this direction.

III.       LITERATURE REVIEW 

Introduction 
Literature  review  for  this  paper  was  covered  on  Social  Media  and  students  performance.  Social  media  has  become  a 
growing phenomenon with many and varied definitions in public and academic use. Any activities where humans share 
stories  and  influence  others  can  be  considered  social  networking  Nicholson,  (2011).  Social  networking  or  media  is  a 
great  forum  for  discussing  mutual  topics  of  interest,  and  perhaps  even  meeting  or  renewing  acquaintances  with  other 
humans virtually. According to Greenwald (2009) and Deloitte (2009), 55% of employees visit a social media site at least 
once a week. 
 

Students and use of Social Networking Sites 
Students are increasingly utilizing these social networks for friends‟ news feeds, personal updates, events and activities, 
notes, and messages. According to an extensive study by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) of the United Kingdom, 
almost half (49%) of children aged 8-17 who used the Internet had set up their own profiles on a social networking site 
Ofcom,  (2008a);  Dowdall,  (2009).  Positive  perceptions  obtained  from  users  of  social  networking  sites  i.e.  effective 
learning which has resulted in an easy learning climate among students Mazer, et al., (2010). In another study conducted 
by  Keenan  and  Shirii,  (2009)  they  explored  how  social  networking  sites  encourage  friendliness  through  the  use  of 
Facebook,  Twitter  and  LinkedIn.  The  study  concluded  that  numerous  approaches  can  be  used  to  encourage  amiability 
among students which leads to a positive effect from SNSs user‟s point of view. In a study conducted by Mazer et al., 
(2007) concluded that Facebook networking site is used by students more frequently and also faculty members. Recent 
data obtained from Facebook through their spokesperson, showed that approximately 297,000 users are university faculty 
members, although there are pros and cons in each case. 
While the researcher agree on both negative and positive impact of social media and academic performance, our aim was 
to broaden the scope of thinking of decision makers to reflect on the realities and to create and maintain a system that can 
change  students‟  attitude  that  will  promote  quality  image  and  improve  upon  performance.  After  a  critical  review  of 
various literatures on social media, the researchers could identify that there are gaps in knowledge as far as the negative 
effect of the use of  “Whatsapp” and students performance especially in Engineering Institutes of Nagpur City, and that 
merits a closer investigation.

A  researcher  has  devised  a  nineteen  question  questionnaire  to  measure  the  impact  of  On  line  chat  app  on  the  personal 
development of students. Each question was a 5-point Likert item from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". In order 
to understand whether the questions in this questionnaire all reliably measure the same latent variable (feeling of safety) 
(so a Likert scale could be constructed), a Cronbach's alpha was run on a sample size of 15 workers. we can seein Table 
No. VI  that Cronbach's alpha is 0.683, which indicates a Good level of internal consistency for our scale.

The world is ever changing due to the advancement technology in every sphere of life. In today‟s hitech world its very 
hard  to  escape  the  presence  of  technology  especially  the  one  available  on  mobile.  Many  of  us  depend  on  it  to  a  great 
extent to do our job to get around and to find certain things and what most people did not even though of few years back, 
is now becoming a reality. 
Online Chap app is one of the changes in technology which is commonly used on specific mobile phones and computers. 
As  the  Smart  Phones  became  popular,  many  messaging  services  were  launched  like  whats  app,  hike,  we  chat,  fb 
messenger etc. All these services are free or a very nominal small amount is charged on year basis. All the online chats 
are highly addictive and affect to a great extent on regular users, the repercussion of which is difficult to control and cure 
especially when the users are happen to be students. 
Internet usage continues to grow at an incredible speed. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection 
today.  In  1995,  it  was  less  than  1%.  The  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  tenfold  from  1999  to  2013.  The first

by 
(http://trak.in/tags/business/2014/11/19/india-300m-internet-users-2014/)  Internet  Users  in  India  will  cross  300  million 
mark  by  December  2014  according  to  „Internet  in  India  2014‟  report  jointly  published  by  the Internet  and  Mobile 
Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International. The year on year growth rate registered stands at impressive 32 
percent. The acceleration of internet growth in India can be gauged from the fact that India took 10 years to move from 
10 to 100 million. It took 3 years to move from 100 to 200 million , whereas the next 100 million (from 200 to 300M) 
milestone was achieved in just 1 year. Even if the same growth is maintained, India will reach 500 million users before 
end of 2016. 
The  report  states  that  the healthy  growth  in  internet  users  has  been  driven  by  rural  Indians who  are  now  increasingly 
accessing internet either on their mobile phones or computers. Rural India registered a growth rate of 39 percent to reach 
101 million users by October 2014, whereas urban India grew by 29 percent to reach 177 million by October 2014. By 
end of December 2014, Urban India will have 190 million internet users (63%), while rural India will have 112 million 
(37%). 
With this rampant use of internet on mobile phones students are the most effected among all as they are in their period of 
learning  and  their  interest  on  Friendship  Social  Interaction,  Personal  Relationship,  Physical  Fitness,  Mental  Fitness, 
Academics  and  Ethical  Behaviour.  As  per  the  news  published  in  the  The  Times  of  India  on  Nov  3,  2014,  “  Mobile

messenger service WhatsApp's user base in India has grown to 70 million active users, which is over a tenth of its global 
users, its business head Neeraj Arora has said. 
"We  have  70  million  active  users  here  who  use  the  application  at  least  once  a  month,"  Arora,  a  vice-president  with 
WhatsApp, said at the fifth annual INK Conference. He said the total user base for the company, which was bought by 
Facebook in a blockbuster $19 billion deal earlier this year, is 600 million.” 
Whats app and other messenger has  been around for a  while but recent updates have improved the functionality of the 
application. The main objective behind this app is to replace SMS with a cross platform mobile messenger that works on 
an  internet  data  plan  with  many  other  advantages  which  is  not  available  on  normal  texting  like  Unlimited  text,  image, 
audio and video sharing etc. Now Whats app has introduced the calling services also. It is currently available for iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 and S40 and Blackberry.  
All  those  apps  brings  us  so  many  benefits,  it  has  also  got  it  flaws  that  are  causing  more  harm  than  good  among  the 
students today. Hence, taking cognizance of the rate at which our youth at various Technical Institutions are hooking up 
to social media, there is dire urgency that first it effects on students various aspects should be studied and second some 
good corrective and preventive measures to be taken in this direction.

III.       LITERATURE REVIEW 

Introduction 
Literature  review  for  this  paper  was  covered  on  Social  Media  and  students  performance.  Social  media  has  become  a 
growing phenomenon with many and varied definitions in public and academic use. Any activities where humans share 
stories  and  influence  others  can  be  considered  social  networking  Nicholson,  (2011).  Social  networking  or  media  is  a 
great  forum  for  discussing  mutual  topics  of  interest,  and  perhaps  even  meeting  or  renewing  acquaintances  with  other 
humans virtually. According to Greenwald (2009) and Deloitte (2009), 55% of employees visit a social media site at least 
once a week. 
 

Students and use of Social Networking Sites 
Students are increasingly utilizing these social networks for friends‟ news feeds, personal updates, events and activities, 
notes, and messages. According to an extensive study by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) of the United Kingdom, 
almost half (49%) of children aged 8-17 who used the Internet had set up their own profiles on a social networking site 
Ofcom,  (2008a);  Dowdall,  (2009).  Positive  perceptions  obtained  from  users  of  social  networking  sites  i.e.  effective 
learning which has resulted in an easy learning climate among students Mazer, et al., (2010). In another study conducted 
by  Keenan  and  Shirii,  (2009)  they  explored  how  social  networking  sites  encourage  friendliness  through  the  use  of 
Facebook,  Twitter  and  LinkedIn.  The  study  concluded  that  numerous  approaches  can  be  used  to  encourage  amiability 
among students which leads to a positive effect from SNSs user‟s point of view. In a study conducted by Mazer et al., 
(2007) concluded that Facebook networking site is used by students more frequently and also faculty members. Recent 
data obtained from Facebook through their spokesperson, showed that approximately 297,000 users are university faculty 
members, although there are pros and cons in each case. 
While the researcher agree on both negative and positive impact of social media and academic performance, our aim was 
to broaden the scope of thinking of decision makers to reflect on the realities and to create and maintain a system that can 
change  students‟  attitude  that  will  promote  quality  image  and  improve  upon  performance.  After  a  critical  review  of 
various literatures on social media, the researchers could identify that there are gaps in knowledge as far as the negative 
effect of the use of  “Whatsapp” and students performance especially in Engineering Institutes of Nagpur City, and that 
merits a closer investigation.

A  researcher  has  devised  a  nineteen  question  questionnaire  to  measure  the  impact  of  On  line  chat  app  on  the  personal 
development of students. Each question was a 5-point Likert item from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". In order 
to understand whether the questions in this questionnaire all reliably measure the same latent variable (feeling of safety) 
(so a Likert scale could be constructed), a Cronbach's alpha was run on a sample size of 15 workers. we can seein Table 
No. VI  that Cronbach's alpha is 0.683, which indicates a Good level of internal consistency for our scale.

The world is ever changing due to the advancement technology in every sphere of life. In today‟s hitech world its very 
hard  to  escape  the  presence  of  technology  especially  the  one  available  on  mobile.  Many  of  us  depend  on  it  to  a  great 
extent to do our job to get around and to find certain things and what most people did not even though of few years back, 
is now becoming a reality. 
Online Chap app is one of the changes in technology which is commonly used on specific mobile phones and computers. 
As  the  Smart  Phones  became  popular,  many  messaging  services  were  launched  like  whats  app,  hike,  we  chat,  fb 
messenger etc. All these services are free or a very nominal small amount is charged on year basis. All the online chats 
are highly addictive and affect to a great extent on regular users, the repercussion of which is difficult to control and cure 
especially when the users are happen to be students. 
Internet usage continues to grow at an incredible speed. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection 
today.  In  1995,  it  was  less  than  1%.  The  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  tenfold  from  1999  to  2013.  The first

http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/). 
by 
(http://trak.in/tags/business/2014/11/19/india-300m-internet-users-2014/)  Internet  Users  in  India  will  cross  300  million 
mark  by  December  2014  according  to  „Internet  in  India  2014‟  report  jointly  published  by  the Internet  and  Mobile 
Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International. The year on year growth rate registered stands at impressive 32 
percent. The acceleration of internet growth in India can be gauged from the fact that India took 10 years to move from 
10 to 100 million. It took 3 years to move from 100 to 200 million , whereas the next 100 million (from 200 to 300M) 
milestone was achieved in just 1 year. Even if the same growth is maintained, India will reach 500 million users before 
end of 2016. 
The  report  states  that  the healthy  growth  in  internet  users  has  been  driven  by  rural  Indians who  are  now  increasingly 
accessing internet either on their mobile phones or computers. Rural India registered a growth rate of 39 percent to reach 
101 million users by October 2014, whereas urban India grew by 29 percent to reach 177 million by October 2014. By 
end of December 2014, Urban India will have 190 million internet users (63%), while rural India will have 112 million 
(37%). 
With this rampant use of internet on mobile phones students are the most effected among all as they are in their period of 
learning  and  their  interest  on  Friendship  Social  Interaction,  Personal  Relationship,  Physical  Fitness,  Mental  Fitness, 
Academics  and  Ethical  Behaviour.  As  per  the  news  published  in  the  The  Times  of  India  on  Nov  3,  2014,  “  Mobile

messenger service WhatsApp's user base in India has grown to 70 million active users, which is over a tenth of its global 
users, its business head Neeraj Arora has said. 
"We  have  70  million  active  users  here  who  use  the  application  at  least  once  a  month,"  Arora,  a  vice-president  with 
WhatsApp, said at the fifth annual INK Conference. He said the total user base for the company, which was bought by 
Facebook in a blockbuster $19 billion deal earlier this year, is 600 million.” 
Whats app and other messenger has  been around for a  while but recent updates have improved the functionality of the 
application. The main objective behind this app is to replace SMS with a cross platform mobile messenger that works on 
an  internet  data  plan  with  many  other  advantages  which  is  not  available  on  normal  texting  like  Unlimited  text,  image, 
audio and video sharing etc. Now Whats app has introduced the calling services also. It is currently available for iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 and S40 and Blackberry.  
All  those  apps  brings  us  so  many  benefits,  it  has  also  got  it  flaws  that  are  causing  more  harm  than  good  among  the 
students today. Hence, taking cognizance of the rate at which our youth at various Technical Institutions are hooking up 
to social media, there is dire urgency that first it effects on students various aspects should be studied and second some 
good corrective and preventive measures to be taken in this direction.

III.       LITERATURE REVIEW 

Introduction 
Literature  review  for  this  paper  was  covered  on  Social  Media  and  students  performance.  Social  media  has  become  a 
growing phenomenon with many and varied definitions in public and academic use. Any activities where humans share 
stories  and  influence  others  can  be  considered  social  networking  Nicholson,  (2011).  Social  networking  or  media  is  a 
great  forum  for  discussing  mutual  topics  of  interest,  and  perhaps  even  meeting  or  renewing  acquaintances  with  other 
humans virtually. According to Greenwald (2009) and Deloitte (2009), 55% of employees visit a social media site at least 
once a week. 
 

Students and use of Social Networking Sites 
Students are increasingly utilizing these social networks for friends‟ news feeds, personal updates, events and activities, 
notes, and messages. According to an extensive study by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) of the United Kingdom, 
almost half (49%) of children aged 8-17 who used the Internet had set up their own profiles on a social networking site 
Ofcom,  (2008a);  Dowdall,  (2009).  Positive  perceptions  obtained  from  users  of  social  networking  sites  i.e.  effective 
learning which has resulted in an easy learning climate among students Mazer, et al., (2010). In another study conducted 
by  Keenan  and  Shirii,  (2009)  they  explored  how  social  networking  sites  encourage  friendliness  through  the  use  of 
Facebook,  Twitter  and  LinkedIn.  The  study  concluded  that  numerous  approaches  can  be  used  to  encourage  amiability 
among students which leads to a positive effect from SNSs user‟s point of view. In a study conducted by Mazer et al., 
(2007) concluded that Facebook networking site is used by students more frequently and also faculty members. Recent 
data obtained from Facebook through their spokesperson, showed that approximately 297,000 users are university faculty 
members, although there are pros and cons in each case. 
While the researcher agree on both negative and positive impact of social media and academic performance, our aim was 
to broaden the scope of thinking of decision makers to reflect on the realities and to create and maintain a system that can 
change  students‟  attitude  that  will  promote  quality  image  and  improve  upon  performance.  After  a  critical  review  of 
various literatures on social media, the researchers could identify that there are gaps in knowledge as far as the negative 
effect of the use of  “Whatsapp” and students performance especially in Engineering Institutes of Nagpur City, and that 
merits a closer investigation.

A  researcher  has  devised  a  nineteen  question  questionnaire  to  measure  the  impact  of  On  line  chat  app  on  the  personal 
development of students. Each question was a 5-point Likert item from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". In order 
to understand whether the questions in this questionnaire all reliably measure the same latent variable (feeling of safety) 
(so a Likert scale could be constructed), a Cronbach's alpha was run on a sample size of 15 workers. we can seein Table 
No. VI  that Cronbach's alpha is 0.683, which indicates a Good level of internal consistency for our scale.

 It is observed that Girls are using more frequently online chat app than boys and hypothesis testing also proved 
that Frequency of using online chat is dependent on gender of the respondents. 

5.  Usability of the online chat app and its frequency of use affect the personal social interaction of Students 
6.  Usability of the online chat app and its frequency of use affect the mental framework of the respondents  
7.  Usability of the online chat app and its frequency of use is dependent on the experience of respondent of using this 
app as the more experienced the respondents is in using online chat app, it is more likely that he will use more the 
online chat and its frequency of using the online chat app 

8.  Frequency of using online chat app affect the physical activities of students 
9.  Frequency of using online chat app affect the academic activities of students 
10.  Usability of online chat app is insignificant to gain of knowledge of respective field. This means that whatever 

respondents sharing on the online chat app is not benefitting them in their respective field. 

 

VI.      CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

From  the  preceding  discussions,  it  is  evidently  clear  that;  Online  Chat  App  is  a  necessary  evil  for  student.  If  used 
negatively it has adverse impact on the social face to face interaction, leads to lack of concentration during study time as 
it gives them urge to check the apps frequently and it results into anxiousness, it takes much of the study time and result 
in poor performance in studies and further whatever is shared through this online chat app is not healthy and it does not 
anyway help them in their respective field. 
Similar to most research, this paper has limitations that point to further opportunities. The authors focused on only six out 
of the numerous aspects of Personal Development like Social Interaction, Personal Relationship, Physical Fitness, Mental 
Fitness, Academics and Ethical Behaviour and too the research was carried out at Engineering Institutes only. Additional 
studies  on  other  aspect  and  field  of  study  would  provide  further  insights  into  the  impact  of    Online  Chat  App  on  the 
personal  developments  of  students.  Although,  framed  within  an  academic  context,  the  research  can  be  utilized  to 
investigate the  use of  Online  Chat app not only at School and Colleges but also at  home,  workplace and  various other 
settings and for a variety of different audiences such as teenagers, young adults, the elderly, or families.  
In  summary,  the  purpose  of  this  paper  was  to  identify  the  impact  of  Online  Chat  app  on  the  personal  development  of 
Students. The study found that, instead of making communication easier and faster thereby enhancing effective flow of 
messages and idea sharing among students, online chat app has rather impacted negatively on the Personality of students. 
As earlier it is stated that this online chat app is necessary evil and we cannot stop the students to use it, however, we can 
diverge  them  and  channelize  them  to  use  this  judiciously  and  constructively  by  the  following  methods  provided  in  the 
recommendation 
 
Recommendations 
The author therefore, recommends the following: 

•  Management of Technical Institutions should intensify guidance and counselling sessions for the students.

T 

he  introduction  of  Social  Networking  chat  app  has  taken  all  by  storm  and  nobody  can  escape  from  getting 
addicted. The perceived high level of usage of social networking site amongst students is inevitable. As in the 
current  scenario  Students  cannot  be  escaped  from  getting  hooked  by  any  of  those  apps  because  of  the 
availability  of  so  many  attractive  features.  However,  little  is  understood  from  empirical  point  of  view  about  the 
intensity of usage of online chap app and its impact on the various aspect of Personality Development of students like 
Social Interaction, Personal  Relationship, Physical  Fitness, Mental  Fitness,  Academics and Ethical Behaviour This 
Study seeks to identify the influence of Online Chat App on Personal Development of Students on the various aspects 
like Social Interaction, Personal Relationship, Physical Fitness, Mental Fitness, Academics and Ethical Behaviour  
To achieve the purpose Quantitative Research was conducted and 704 structured questionnaires were administered to 
students of Engineering Institutes.  
The study has revealed very interesting facts that usage of Online Chat Apps and its frequency of checking take time 
of the Students and affects their study and health which results in problems of procrastination & leads to distraction 
from Study. Beside this, whatever shared on the chat app is insignificant to their respective field . On the basis of the 
conclusion  and  outcome,  recommendations  and  suggestions  are  provided  to  curb  the  menace  and  to  develop  the 
personality of the students. 
This  study  will  help  in  re-engineering  the  Teaching  Methodology  by  mitigating  the  negative  influence  of  On  Line 
Chat App.

The world is ever changing due to the advancement technology in every sphere of life. In today‟s hitech world its very 
hard  to  escape  the  presence  of  technology  especially  the  one  available  on  mobile.  Many  of  us  depend  on  it  to  a  great 
extent to do our job to get around and to find certain things and what most people did not even though of few years back, 
is now becoming a reality. 
Online Chap app is one of the changes in technology which is commonly used on specific mobile phones and computers. 
As  the  Smart  Phones  became  popular,  many  messaging  services  were  launched  like  whats  app,  hike,  we  chat,  fb 
messenger etc. All these services are free or a very nominal small amount is charged on year basis. All the online chats 
are highly addictive and affect to a great extent on regular users, the repercussion of which is difficult to control and cure 
especially when the users are happen to be students. 
Internet usage continues to grow at an incredible speed. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection 
today.  In  1995,  it  was  less  than  1%.  The  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  tenfold  from  1999  to  2013.  The first

http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/). 
by 
(http://trak.in/tags/business/2014/11/19/india-300m-internet-users-2014/)  Internet  Users  in  India  will  cross  300  million 
mark  by  December  2014  according  to  „Internet  in  India  2014‟  report  jointly  published  by  the Internet  and  Mobile 
Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International. The year on year growth rate registered stands at impressive 32 
percent. The acceleration of internet growth in India can be gauged from the fact that India took 10 years to move from 
10 to 100 million. It took 3 years to move from 100 to 200 million , whereas the next 100 million (from 200 to 300M) 
milestone was achieved in just 1 year. Even if the same growth is maintained, India will reach 500 million users before 
end of 2016. 
The  report  states  that  the healthy  growth  in  internet  users  has  been  driven  by  rural  Indians who  are  now  increasingly 
accessing internet either on their mobile phones or computers. Rural India registered a growth rate of 39 percent to reach 
101 million users by October 2014, whereas urban India grew by 29 percent to reach 177 million by October 2014. By 
end of December 2014, Urban India will have 190 million internet users (63%), while rural India will have 112 million 
(37%). 
With this rampant use of internet on mobile phones students are the most effected among all as they are in their period of 
learning  and  their  interest  on  Friendship  Social  Interaction,  Personal  Relationship,  Physical  Fitness,  Mental  Fitness, 
Academics  and  Ethical  Behaviour.  As  per  the  news  published  in  the  The  Times  of  India  on  Nov  3,  2014,  “  Mobile

messenger service WhatsApp's user base in India has grown to 70 million active users, which is over a tenth of its global 
users, its business head Neeraj Arora has said. 
"We  have  70  million  active  users  here  who  use  the  application  at  least  once  a  month,"  Arora,  a  vice-president  with 
WhatsApp, said at the fifth annual INK Conference. He said the total user base for the company, which was bought by 
Facebook in a blockbuster $19 billion deal earlier this year, is 600 million.” 
Whats app and other messenger has  been around for a  while but recent updates have improved the functionality of the 
application. The main objective behind this app is to replace SMS with a cross platform mobile messenger that works on 
an  internet  data  plan  with  many  other  advantages  which  is  not  available  on  normal  texting  like  Unlimited  text,  image, 
audio and video sharing etc. Now Whats app has introduced the calling services also. It is currently available for iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 and S40 and Blackberry.  
All  those  apps  brings  us  so  many  benefits,  it  has  also  got  it  flaws  that  are  causing  more  harm  than  good  among  the 
students today. Hence, taking cognizance of the rate at which our youth at various Technical Institutions are hooking up 
to social media, there is dire urgency that first it effects on students various aspects should be studied and second some 
good corrective and preventive measures to be taken in this direction.

III.       LITERATURE REVIEW 

Introduction 
Literature  review  for  this  paper  was  covered  on  Social  Media  and  students  performance.  Social  media  has  become  a 
growing phenomenon with many and varied definitions in public and academic use. Any activities where humans share 
stories  and  influence  others  can  be  considered  social  networking  Nicholson,  (2011).  Social  networking  or  media  is  a 
great  forum  for  discussing  mutual  topics  of  interest,  and  perhaps  even  meeting  or  renewing  acquaintances  with  other 
humans virtually. According to Greenwald (2009) and Deloitte (2009), 55% of employees visit a social media site at least 
once a week. 
 

Students and use of Social Networking Sites 
Students are increasingly utilizing these social networks for friends‟ news feeds, personal updates, events and activities, 
notes, and messages. According to an extensive study by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) of the United Kingdom, 
almost half (49%) of children aged 8-17 who used the Internet had set up their own profiles on a social networking site 
Ofcom,  (2008a);  Dowdall,  (2009).  Positive  perceptions  obtained  from  users  of  social  networking  sites  i.e.  effective 
learning which has resulted in an easy learning climate among students Mazer, et al., (2010). In another study conducted 
by  Keenan  and  Shirii,  (2009)  they  explored  how  social  networking  sites  encourage  friendliness  through  the  use  of 
Facebook,  Twitter  and  LinkedIn.  The  study  concluded  that  numerous  approaches  can  be  used  to  encourage  amiability 
among students which leads to a positive effect from SNSs user‟s point of view. In a study conducted by Mazer et al., 
(2007) concluded that Facebook networking site is used by students more frequently and also faculty members. Recent 
data obtained from Facebook through their spokesperson, showed that approximately 297,000 users are university faculty 
members, although there are pros and cons in each case. 
While the researcher agree on both negative and positive impact of social media and academic performance, our aim was 
to broaden the scope of thinking of decision makers to reflect on the realities and to create and maintain a system that can 
change  students‟  attitude  that  will  promote  quality  image  and  improve  upon  performance.  After  a  critical  review  of 
various literatures on social media, the researchers could identify that there are gaps in knowledge as far as the negative 
effect of the use of  “Whatsapp” and students performance especially in Engineering Institutes of Nagpur City, and that 
merits a closer investigation.

A  researcher  has  devised  a  nineteen  question  questionnaire  to  measure  the  impact  of  On  line  chat  app  on  the  personal 
development of students. Each question was a 5-point Likert item from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". In order 
to understand whether the questions in this questionnaire all reliably measure the same latent variable (feeling of safety) 
(so a Likert scale could be constructed), a Cronbach's alpha was run on a sample size of 15 workers. we can seein Table 
No. VI  that Cronbach's alpha is 0.683, which indicates a Good level of internal consistency for our scale.

VI.      CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

From  the  preceding  discussions,  it  is  evidently  clear  that;  Online  Chat  App  is  a  necessary  evil  for  student.  If  used 
negatively it has adverse impact on the social face to face interaction, leads to lack of concentration during study time as 
it gives them urge to check the apps frequently and it results into anxiousness, it takes much of the study time and result 
in poor performance in studies and further whatever is shared through this online chat app is not healthy and it does not 
anyway help them in their respective field. 
Similar to most research, this paper has limitations that point to further opportunities. The authors focused on only six out 
of the numerous aspects of Personal Development like Social Interaction, Personal Relationship, Physical Fitness, Mental 
Fitness, Academics and Ethical Behaviour and too the research was carried out at Engineering Institutes only. Additional 
studies  on  other  aspect  and  field  of  study  would  provide  further  insights  into  the  impact  of    Online  Chat  App  on  the 
personal  developments  of  students.  Although,  framed  within  an  academic  context,  the  research  can  be  utilized  to 
investigate the  use of  Online  Chat app not only at School and Colleges but also at  home,  workplace and  various other 
settings and for a variety of different audiences such as teenagers, young adults, the elderly, or families.  
In  summary,  the  purpose  of  this  paper  was  to  identify  the  impact  of  Online  Chat  app  on  the  personal  development  of 
Students. The study found that, instead of making communication easier and faster thereby enhancing effective flow of 
messages and idea sharing among students, online chat app has rather impacted negatively on the Personality of students. 
As earlier it is stated that this online chat app is necessary evil and we cannot stop the students to use it, however, we can 
diverge  them  and  channelize  them  to  use  this  judiciously  and  constructively  by  the  following  methods  provided  in  the 
recommendation 
 
Recommendations 
The author therefore, recommends the following: 

•  Management of Technical Institutions should intensify guidance and counselling sessions for the students.

•  Time management should be incorporated into the curriculum of Technical Education. 
• 

Sudden  Unannounced  quizzes  should  be  conducted  frequently  by  teachers/lecturers  to  compel  students  to  sit-up 
and concentrate more on the study and lectures . 

•  Cell  phones  should  either  be  forbidden  in  lecture  halls  or  switched  off  if  allowed  in,  instead  of  the  prevailing 

• 

practice of allowing them in but must be put on mute. This allows the students to chat during lectures.  
Students  must  be  enlightened  on  the  devastating  effect  of  retiring  to  the  short  hand  form  of  writing  on  their 
spellings and grammatical construction of sentences during their communication skills lessons in first year. 

•  Considering the fact that majority of students are using this app, it is necessary that methodology of teaching to be 
changed and teachers needs to be more active and participate in the online groups of students so that check can be 
made on the contents of the matter and analyzing the students who are becoming addicted to this app.
