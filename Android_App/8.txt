Abstract.  In  this  paper,  we  present  an  app  development  using  sensor  signals 
from  smartphone  ans  smart  watch.  We  use  Bluetooth  communication  for  the 
connection between the smartphone and the smart watch. Smart watch includes 
a various of sensors such as acceleration sensor, gyro sensor, pressure sersor, 
etc.  Using  these  sensors,  we  can  measure  the  movement  data of  the user  and 
transmit  to  the  smartphone.  In  this  study,  we  measure  the  values  of  the  gyro 
sensor and acceleration sensor, and transfer them to the smartphone for game 
app development.

1      Introduction 

Various  wearable  devices  have  been  widely  used  recently.  [1]  [2].  Lots  of 
companies  have  released  their  smart  wearable  devices  such  as  smart  glasses,  smart 
bracelet,  smart  necklace,  and  so  on.  Among  them,  smart  watch  is  the  most  typical 
device representing the wearable technology trend. Smart watch provides not only the 
function of watch itself, but also provides additional features using a various sensors 
like acceleration sensor and a gyro sensor. For example, there are some sensor related 
apps such as pedometer, heart rate, and exercise assistance app and so on [3]. Novel 
smart watch technologies provide an interesting opportunity to design new forms of 
user interaction with mobile phones [4].   

In this paper, we connect the smart watch and smartphones using Bluetooth for app 
development.  After  the  connection  has  completed,  smart  watch  collects  movement 
data of the user and transmits them to the smartphone. From this connecting technique, 
smart watch can be a tool for the motion based game app in the future.

2.1      Samsung Gear 

Samsung Gear is one of smart watch provided by Samsung. The smartphone app is 
developed  using  the  Android  APIs,  whereas,  the  smart  watch  widget  is  developed 
using the Tizen wearable platform [5]. 

Since  it  has  accelerometer,  gyroscope  and  heart  rate  sensor,  developer  can 
implement creative apps using those sensors. Samsung differentiate three types of app 
such as linked type, integrated type and standalone type. First, linked type app should 
be  developed  smartphone  part  and  smart  watch  part  separately.  Second,  integrated 
type  app  contains  both  part  in  one  app.  Last,  standalone  type  app  does  not  need  a 
smartphone  part  app,  and  can  be  operated  independently  [6].  In  this  paper,  sample 
experimental app is developed as an integrated type.

4      Experimental Results 

4.1      Implementation of the Experimental app 

For  the  experimental  app  implementation,  we  use  the  Android  SDK  Platform  4.4.2 
"Kitkat"  and  Tizen  SDK  for  Wearable  1.0.0b2  on  Eclipse  as  the  development 
environment. In the experimental app, we can measure accelerometer data and gyro 
sensor  data,  and  successfully  transmit  the  data  to  the  smartphone.  For  the  testing 
purpose, the experiment is conducted on Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Gear 2. 

4.2      Transmission sensor data from smart watch to smartphone 

For the same experiment environment, we wear a smart watch on left wrist. In this 
study, acceleration sensor and gyro sensor are tested. The process can be describe as 
the following.

First, a user fixed the wrist and moved the wrist to the front as a similar speed for 
measuring acceleration sensor data. Second, a user rolled the wrist as a same pattern 
for measuring gyro sensor data. We have experiment ten times in the same way.   

From  the  experiment,  average  of  the  accelerometer  size  was  around  8.7  and 
average  of  x  axis  gyro  sensor  data  was  around  17.3.  Although  we  did  simple

5    Conclusion 

In  this  paper,  we  presented  an  app  development  based  on  the  sensor  signals  from 
smart  watch  and  smartphone.  The  smartphone  and  smart  watch  are  connected  by 
Bluetooth.  Acceleration  sensor  and  gyro  sensor  are  used  for  the  transmission 
experiment  and  we  get  the  desired  results.  From  the  result,  we  confirm  that  smart 
watch can be a tool for the motion based game app.   

In this study, we have checked data transmission between smartphone and smart 
watch  with  simple  app  and widget  for  app  development.  In  the  next  work,  we  will 
design and implement a motion based game app. For implementation of the game app, 
we  should  measure  the  sensor  data  of  the  user  more  and  analysis  the  pattern.  This 
remains as the future work.
