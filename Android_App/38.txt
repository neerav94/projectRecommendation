man, it is 10-20%, and for a woman 18-28%.1   
  The percentages of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat are different individually by the   
degree of obesity and the amount of exercise. 
When  people  become  adult  with  obesity,  normally  the  abdominal  fat  percentage 
becomes higher due to an excessive visceral fat. This abdominal obesity is the cause 
of adult diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disorder and diabetes. 
It is because the  subcutaneous fat is accumulated  far  from the center of the  human 
body anatomically. Yet, even though the oxygen transfers through microvessles, the 
visceral fat relatively connects with large blood vessels so that it is highly active.

is  much  error  in  the  body  fat  measurement    depending  on  how  a  user  grabs  the 
electrodes with hands.   
In case when he grabs electrodes properly, there is about 10% error compared to the 
product for common use.   

3    Test and Result 

3.1 How to measure the body fat 

The above figure shows a circuit diagram for the measurement of the body fat. In the 
first component of the circuit diagram, there is a part which causes a frequency of 100 
uA, 50 KHz entering into the body. 
Due to a delicate difference in PCB pattern, in order to overcome the some voltage 
differential  in  each  board,  namely  for  calibration,  5  KΩ  adjustable  resistance  is 
provided.

through the body, it comes out by both inverting amplifier and non inverting amplifier. 
The output signal is analyzed by ADC of MCU and MCU to measure the degree of 
the final body fat. For Calibration, R58, R59, R60 parts should be connected in the 
above circuit diagram, and it should be controlled to have +(-) 1Vp-p in TP8 

3.2 Result from Implementation 

This display shows the test result of the body fat measurement by DDR function of 
Eclipse smart display capturing which is a tool for the development of Android.

Figure 2 shows an example of a high Pass filter application. It can be seen that the 
clear electrocardiogram signal has come out by applying filter at channels 1, 2, and 3.

In this paper, for the accurate electrocardiogram measurement, the filter circuit, which 
can  remove  Low  Pass  Filter,  High  Pass  Filter  and  Power  Noise,  has  been 
implemented  to  reduce  error  caused  by  the  noise  of  the  measuring  sensor  in  the 
system which measures the body fat signal.           
In  this  paper,  the  App(application)  of  the  body  fat  measurement  has  been 
implemented and displayed, which measures the body fat in the embedded system in 
which the Android has been porting   
This means that it can simply diagnose not only an Android link electrocardiogram 
measurement  system  but  also  a  real  ubiquitous  through  various  communication 
equipments and their methods.   
Also, it has a merit to offer effective diagnosis service with low cost through linkage 
with the USN base system. 
As this system can transfer data by using communication means based on Android, 
the next study about information security method should be done at the same time to 
protect information of a user.
