Abstract 

Fostering spatial competencies of children has been positively discussed across disciplines and institutes. As  most  exiting tools for spatial 
learning are based on existing software such as geographic information systems, these tools may not be suitable for children at the age of 8 to 
12. With this goal in mind, we designed the Orientation Gaming App (Ori-Gami) fostering the development of spatial competencies and spatial 
learning of children in a gaming scenario. Children only need to follow intuitive instructions combined with visual and auditive hints given by 
the  app  to  complete  the  game  in  an  outdoor  environment.  Throughout  the  process,  children  engage  in  activities  involving  essential  spatial 
competencies such as map learning, orientation, and wayfinding. This paper presents the concept, design and usability tests of Ori-Gami used by 
both  children  and  adult  students.  Results  confirm  our  principles  of  designing  a  tool  specifically  for  children  to  foster  their  development  of 
essential spatial competencies such as orientation, wayfinding and map understanding.

Introduction 

What  children  learn  in  school  forms  the  basis  for  their 
approach to society and to science. To foster the role of spatial 
information  in  society  and  to  support  the  development  of 
spatial skills and competences it is important to point learners 
early on to the transdisciplinary power of spatial information 
and spatial thinking. When Goodchild coined a spatial literacy 
to appear in the curricula and in education on the same level 
as a mathematical and linguistic literacy [1] he was speaking 
about a transdisciplinary competence to think spatially in all 
subjects: from STEM1, to social sciences and arts. The NRC 
report  “Learning  to  think  spatially”  was  leading  into  this 
direction and presented solutions for Geographic Information 
Systems  (GIS)  as  a  support  system  to  think  spatially  [2]. 
Minimal GIS approaches for all grade levels at school, when 
particular  spatial  concepts  were  incidentally  used,  followed 
this direction in several studies [3-5]. 

In our Geospatial Learning project, we develop software to 
support spatial thinking by following the known principles to 
foster  orientation,  wayfinding  and  map  understanding  skills. 
We  combine  them  with  user-centered  design,  game-based 
learning,  and  situated  computing  and  evaluate  our  software 
with  different  usability  and  spatial  competence  tests.  Our 
applications concentrate on the targeted group at the age of 8 
to  12,  following  the  developmental  stage  [6,  7]  and  its 
representation  in  most  curricula  [8,  9].  The  applications 
developed  within  this  project  are  following  the  curricular 
requirements

Ori-Gami is an app for browsers or tablets. Depending on the 
platform  it  can  be  used  stationary  or  mobile  with  the  use  of 
GPS.  It  consists  of  a  simple  base  map  and  displays  route 
instructions of varying complexity (use of directions, cardinal 
directions, landmarks and distances) provided by a teacher, or 
game leader in an online editor. The user can either click on 
the  decision  points  described  in  the  verbal  instructions 
(browser version, Figure 1) or walk along the instructed path 
with the device (tablet version, Figure 2). 
Feedback, help and game elements allow the user to orientate 
and find reference points in the map and the real world. The 
blue dot in the map indicates the current position located by 
the  device  or  selected  by  the  user.  The  smiley  provides 
feedback  on  the  current  position:  It  changes  color  and

player is moving into the direction of the next waypoint. Each 
time  the  player  reaches  a  waypoint,  the  app  signals  this  by

as polygons and streets as lines). The movement of the user’s 
representation  on  the  map  continuously  updated  by  the 
moving blue dot helps the user to create a representation and 
understand map concepts and symbols.  
Orientation. The available spatial representations in the map 
help  the  user  to  gain  survey  knowledge  of  her  environment. 
Together with the reference of her own position she is able to 
orientate herself and point to or walk into distinct directions.  
Wayfinding.  The  use  of  verbal  directions  during  an 
exploration task leads to accurate environmental learning [14] 
as 
to  construct  an  appropriate  spatial 
representation  from  the  verbal  directions  [15]  which  is 
essential for wayfinding. 
Game-Based Learning. By using several elements of digital 
game-based-learning  (DGBL)  in  the  app  design  (cf.  section 
3.1.) we try to motivate the users, while training their spatial 
competences  at  the  same  time.  DGBL  can  be  understood  as 
“any  marriage  of  educational  content  and  computer  games“ 
[15]. 
 
4  Usability Test 

the  user  needs 

 

The usability test investigates the usage performance and the 
subjective user satisfaction. As this is a usability test, we do 
not  examine  the  learning  success  with  respect  to  spatial 
competencies.  

4.1  Design 
The  tablet  version  of  the  Ori-Gami  App  is  used  for  the 
usability  test.  The  test  involves  two  phases:  In  phase  one, 
participants play the game on-site. The experimenter leads the 
participants  to  the  starting  point.  The  app  shows  the  first 
wayfinding  instruction.  The  participants  have  to  follow  each 
instruction until the smiley and the audio signal indicate that 
they reached the waypoint. We tested two alternative routes. 
The  system  automatically  switches  to  the  next  instruction  to 
follow. The tablet is equipped with GPS signal and tracks the 
route as well as the touch interactions on the display. 

In the second phase of the usability tests, participants have 
to complete a questionnaire, designed for this distinct project, 
with a focus on the map-based application. Questions one to 
four refer to their previous experience with paper and digital 
maps,  with  tablets  and  the  familiarity  with  the  environment. 
They  required  a  yes/no  response  and  offered  a  text  field  for 
further  details  if  the  question  was  answered  with  yes. 
Questions five to seven refer to the subjective user satisfaction 
where participants indicate their agreement. In questions eight 
to  thirteen,  participants  are  asked  to  for  feedback  to  outline 
problems,  report  on  their  experience  with  the  app  and  give 

 

 

 

suggestions  for  improvement.  These  were  open  question. 
Figure 3 lists the questions asked in the usability test.

computer or a notebook before? 
4. Did you work with a map on a tablet or iPad before?

10. What was particularly easy for you? 
11. What was particularly difficult for you? 
12. Was there anything you did not understand? 
13. Do you have any ideas to improve the app? 
 
The  usability  of  the  software  was  tested  with  two  user 
groups: a group of 9 geoinformatics students (age M 24.5, SD 
4.4) and a target group of 12 ten-year old children of a local 
school.  The  first  group  includes  experts  in  geoinformatics 
with  high-developed  spatial  competencies  and  experience  as 
indicated by the first four statements in the questionnaire. The 
second group is assumed to have lower spatial competencies 
(as  they  are  still  to  be  trained  according  to  educational 
guidelines),  but  they  have  very  good  knowledge  of  the 
environment, since the game took place in the surroundings of 
their school. 

4.2  Results and Discussion 
The  location  of  the  participant  during  the  experiment  was 
recorded  while  navigating  via  the  integrated  GPS-receiver. 
The  participants  from  both  age  groups  walked  similar 
distances  on  both  routes.  A  significant  difference  could  be 
found in the average walking speed, as the children user group 
was  walking  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  4  km/h,  the 
older  user  group  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  6  km/h. 
This  may  be  a  general  manner  of  different  walking  speed, 
another reason could be, that the younger group did not feel 
comfortable to walk with a tablet device and constantly look 
at  the  device  and  their  surroundings.  On  both  routes  two 
children  made  an  error  in  following  the  instructions,  which 
concluded in a longer walking distance of 20-40m. The error 
was taking a wrong direction on a decision point (crossing) or 
just missing a decision point by walking to far (Figure 4). The 
errors were found in different locations. The older participants 
did  not  make  any  errors  and  followed  the  route  instructions 
very  quickly.  A  reason  for  that  may  be  their well-developed 
spatial  competences  as  map  understanding  and  orientation. 
They  could

Abstract 

Fostering spatial competencies of children has been positively discussed across disciplines and institutes. As  most  exiting tools for spatial 
learning are based on existing software such as geographic information systems, these tools may not be suitable for children at the age of 8 to 
12. With this goal in mind, we designed the Orientation Gaming App (Ori-Gami) fostering the development of spatial competencies and spatial 
learning of children in a gaming scenario. Children only need to follow intuitive instructions combined with visual and auditive hints given by 
the  app  to  complete  the  game  in  an  outdoor  environment.  Throughout  the  process,  children  engage  in  activities  involving  essential  spatial 
competencies such as map learning, orientation, and wayfinding. This paper presents the concept, design and usability tests of Ori-Gami used by 
both  children  and  adult  students.  Results  confirm  our  principles  of  designing  a  tool  specifically  for  children  to  foster  their  development  of 
essential spatial competencies such as orientation, wayfinding and map understanding.

Introduction 

What  children  learn  in  school  forms  the  basis  for  their 
approach to society and to science. To foster the role of spatial 
information  in  society  and  to  support  the  development  of 
spatial skills and competences it is important to point learners 
early on to the transdisciplinary power of spatial information 
and spatial thinking. When Goodchild coined a spatial literacy 
to appear in the curricula and in education on the same level 
as a mathematical and linguistic literacy [1] he was speaking 
about a transdisciplinary competence to think spatially in all 
subjects: from STEM1, to social sciences and arts. The NRC 
report  “Learning  to  think  spatially”  was  leading  into  this 
direction and presented solutions for Geographic Information 
Systems  (GIS)  as  a  support  system  to  think  spatially  [2]. 
Minimal GIS approaches for all grade levels at school, when 
particular  spatial  concepts  were  incidentally  used,  followed 
this direction in several studies [3-5]. 

In our Geospatial Learning project, we develop software to 
support spatial thinking by following the known principles to 
foster  orientation,  wayfinding  and  map  understanding  skills. 
We  combine  them  with  user-centered  design,  game-based 
learning,  and  situated  computing  and  evaluate  our  software 
with  different  usability  and  spatial  competence  tests.  Our 
applications concentrate on the targeted group at the age of 8 
to  12,  following  the  developmental  stage  [6,  7]  and  its 
representation  in  most  curricula  [8,  9].  The  applications 
developed  within  this  project  are  following  the  curricular 
requirements 
practical 
requirements,  since  schools  do  not  concentrate  on  outdoor 
activities  for  classes  of  geography  [10,  p.  74]  where  spatial 
competencies can be fostered.

In  this  paper  we  present  our  app  “Ori-Gami”  (Orientation 
Gaming), which is a game to support children to enhance their 
map  understanding,  orientation  and  wayfinding  skills,  and 
explain  the  educational  background  of  this  game.  Usability 
and  user  satisfaction  is  a  key  factor  for  the  success  of 
educational  games.  Thus,  this  paper  describes  the  concept, 
design  and  usability-test  of  Ori-Gami.  Section  2  gives  an 
overview of related initiatives working on spatial thinking and 
spatial learning. In section 3, we describe our app and explain 
the  educational  motivation  behind  the  game.  Section  4 
presents  the  design  and  discusses  the  results  of  the  usability 
study. Section 5 concludes the paper by outlining implications 
from  the  usability  study  for  the  development  of  focused 
spatial learning apps and directions for future work. 

 
 
2  Related Work 

Numerous researchers worked on supporting spatial thinking 
and  competency  development.  These  topics  have  been  the 
focus of several recent and distinctive academic initiatives and 
programs  around  the  globe  (e.g.  SILC2,  spatial@uscb3, 
LENS4, CSISS5, SPLINT6) and have been picked as a central 
theme  at  an  NRC  specialist  meeting  in  the  United  States 
documented  in  the  NRC-Report  Learning  to  think  Spatially 
[11]. In the following, we review recent activities from a GI 
Science perspective.

The  main  goal  of  the  “Spatial  Intelligence  and  Learning 
Center”  (SILC)  is  the  understanding  of  spatial  learning  and 
using  this  knowledge  to  produce  course  specific  software  to 
support  spatial  skills.  SILC  participants  include  researchers 
from  cognitive  science,  psychology,  computer  science, 
education,  and  neuroscience,  as  well  as  practicing 
geoscientists and engineers who are particularly interested in 
spatial thinking in their fields.  

Spatial@ucsb  is  a  research  center  at  the  University  of 
California,  Santa  Barbara.  Its  mission  is  to  facilitate  the 
integration of spatial thinking into processes for learning and 
discovery  in  the  natural,  social,  and  behavioral  sciences,  to 
promote excellence in engineering and applied sciences, and 
to enhance creativity in the arts and humanities. Spatial@ucsb 
also is promoting the development of spatial analytic tools. 

LEarNing  Spatially  (LENS)  is  an  initiative  promoting 
spatial  literacy  at  the  University  of  Redlands  working  on 
spatial thinking in school curricula and research. They define 
spatial  thinking  as  “the  ability  to  visualize  and  interpret 
location,  distance,  direction,  relationships,  movement  and 
change through space” [12]. They use geospatial technologies 
to  teach  a  critical  way  of  spatial  thinking  and  support 
geography  students  in  solving  spatial  problems,  visualizing 
results  and  interpreting  relationships  better  through  spatial 
technologies. 

The Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science (CSISS) 
at  the  University  of  Santa  Barbara  emphasizes  the  growing 
significance of spatial information in social science research. 
CSISS  supports unrestricted  access  to  tools  and  perspectives 
that  will  advance 
the  spatial  analytic  capabilities  of 
researchers throughout the social sciences. 

The  Spatial  Literacy  in  Teaching  (SPLINT)  Centre  of 
Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) is a consortium 
of  three  British  Universities  (Leicester,  Nottingham,  UCL) 
aiming to enhance the teaching and learning of spatial literacy 
focusing on geospatial technologies. 

Education  systems  all  over  the  world  start  integrating  the 
use  of  spatial  technologies  in  their  curricula  to  foster 
competences like spatial orientation – mostly in the geography 
context,  but  also  interdisciplinary  in  and  beyond  K-12  and 
undergraduate  studies  (i.e.  [13]).  However,  still  fundamental 
definitions on spatial thinking and interconnection of concepts 
in the related disciplines and communities are not established.

3  Ori-Gami and its Educational Concept 

3.1  The App 
Ori-Gami is an app for browsers or tablets. Depending on the 
platform  it  can  be  used  stationary  or  mobile  with  the  use  of 
GPS.  It  consists  of  a  simple  base  map  and  displays  route 
instructions of varying complexity (use of directions, cardinal 
directions, landmarks and distances) provided by a teacher, or 
game leader in an online editor. The user can either click on 
the  decision  points  described  in  the  verbal  instructions 
(browser version, Figure 1) or walk along the instructed path 
with the device (tablet version, Figure 2). 
Feedback, help and game elements allow the user to orientate 
and find reference points in the map and the real world. The 
blue dot in the map indicates the current position located by 
the  device  or  selected  by  the  user.  The  smiley  provides 
feedback  on  the  current  position:  It  changes  color  and 
friendliness  to  give  easy-to  understand  hints  whether  the 
player is moving into the direction of the next waypoint. Each 
time  the  player  reaches  a  waypoint,  the  app  signals  this  by 
playing  a  sound  and  visually  via  a  happy  smiley.  The  next 
wayfinding 
instructions  are  automatically  displayed.  A 
trumpet sound and a text at the end of a route gives the user 
feedback, that she has reached the goal.

3.2  The Educational Concept  
The  app 
fosters  spatial  competencies  such  as  map 
understanding,  orientation,  and  wayfinding  in  a  game-based 
learning style. 
Map understanding. The visualisation of the user’s position 
via GPS in the mobile version (Figure 2) is a major support in 
map  understanding.  Children  in  the  target  group  are  usually 
not able to locate themselves on a map, since it is difficult to 
connect 
spatial 
representation on a base map (where buildings are represented 
as polygons and streets as lines). The movement of the user’s 
representation  on  the  map  continuously  updated  by  the 
moving blue dot helps the user to create a representation and 
understand map concepts and symbols.  
Orientation. The available spatial representations in the map 
help  the  user  to  gain  survey  knowledge  of  her  environment. 
Together with the reference of her own position she is able to 
orientate herself and point to or walk into distinct directions.  
Wayfinding.  The  use  of  verbal  directions  during  an 
exploration task leads to accurate environmental learning [14] 
as 
to  construct  an  appropriate  spatial 
representation  from  the  verbal  directions  [15]  which  is 
essential for wayfinding. 
Game-Based Learning. By using several elements of digital 
game-based-learning  (DGBL)  in  the  app  design  (cf.  section 
3.1.) we try to motivate the users, while training their spatial 
competences  at  the  same  time.  DGBL  can  be  understood  as 
“any  marriage  of  educational  content  and  computer  games“ 
[15]. 
 
4  Usability Test 

the  user  needs 

 

The usability test investigates the usage performance and the 
subjective user satisfaction. As this is a usability test, we do 
not  examine  the  learning  success  with  respect  to  spatial 
competencies.  

4.1  Design 
The  tablet  version  of  the  Ori-Gami  App  is  used  for  the 
usability  test.  The  test  involves  two  phases:  In  phase  one, 
participants play the game on-site. The experimenter leads the 
participants  to  the  starting  point.  The  app  shows  the  first 
wayfinding  instruction.  The  participants  have  to  follow  each 
instruction until the smiley and the audio signal indicate that 
they reached the waypoint. We tested two alternative routes. 
The  system  automatically  switches  to  the  next  instruction  to 
follow. The tablet is equipped with GPS signal and tracks the 
route as well as the touch interactions on the display. 

In the second phase of the usability tests, participants have 
to complete a questionnaire, designed for this distinct project, 
with a focus on the map-based application. Questions one to 
four refer to their previous experience with paper and digital 
maps,  with  tablets  and  the  familiarity  with  the  environment. 
They  required  a  yes/no  response  and  offered  a  text  field  for 
further  details  if  the  question  was  answered  with  yes. 
Questions five to seven refer to the subjective user satisfaction 
where participants indicate their agreement. In questions eight 
to  thirteen,  participants  are  asked  to  for  feedback  to  outline 
problems,  report  on  their  experience  with  the  app  and  give 

 

 

 

suggestions  for  improvement.  These  were  open  question. 
Figure 3 lists the questions asked in the usability test. 

Figure 3: Questions in the Usability Questionnaire. 

 
Questionnaire: 
1. Did you use a paper map to search for a location before? 
2. Did you try to orient yourself with a map at an unfamiliar place 
before? 
3.  Did  you  work  with  a  map  (such  as  GoogleMaps/Earth)  on  a 
computer or a notebook before? 
4. Did you work with a map on a tablet or iPad before? 
 
5. Did you like working with our app? 
6. Would you like to use such an app in in the lectures? 
7. Would you like to play such a game in your leisure time?  
 
8. What did you like about this app? 
9. What did you not like about this app? 
10. What was particularly easy for you? 
11. What was particularly difficult for you? 
12. Was there anything you did not understand? 
13. Do you have any ideas to improve the app? 
 
The  usability  of  the  software  was  tested  with  two  user 
groups: a group of 9 geoinformatics students (age M 24.5, SD 
4.4) and a target group of 12 ten-year old children of a local 
school.  The  first  group  includes  experts  in  geoinformatics 
with  high-developed  spatial  competencies  and  experience  as 
indicated by the first four statements in the questionnaire. The 
second group is assumed to have lower spatial competencies 
(as  they  are  still  to  be  trained  according  to  educational 
guidelines),  but  they  have  very  good  knowledge  of  the 
environment, since the game took place in the surroundings of 
their school. 

4.2  Results and Discussion 
The  location  of  the  participant  during  the  experiment  was 
recorded  while  navigating  via  the  integrated  GPS-receiver. 
The  participants  from  both  age  groups  walked  similar 
distances  on  both  routes.  A  significant  difference  could  be 
found in the average walking speed, as the children user group 
was  walking  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  4  km/h,  the 
older  user  group  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  6  km/h. 
This  may  be  a  general  manner  of  different  walking  speed, 
another reason could be, that the younger group did not feel 
comfortable to walk with a tablet device and constantly look 
at  the  device  and  their  surroundings.  On  both  routes  two 
children  made  an  error  in  following  the  instructions,  which 
concluded in a longer walking distance of 20-40m. The error 
was taking a wrong direction on a decision point (crossing) or 
just missing a decision point by walking to far (Figure 4). The 
errors were found in different locations. The older participants 
did  not  make  any  errors  and  followed  the  route  instructions 
very  quickly.  A  reason  for  that  may  be  their well-developed 
spatial  competences  as  map  understanding  and  orientation.

(Figure  5)  shows  that  children  and  students  performed  very 
distinctive interactions with the app on the tablet. Children in 
this experiment mostly touched the map area in the app during 
the experiment. But students touched also the area where the 
instructions  were  given.  In  follow-up  interviews  with  the 
student  participants  they  explained  that  they  touched  the 
instruction  areas  with  the  intention  to  learn  follow-up 
instruction  in  order  to  grasp  an  overview  of  this  task.  The 
interaction with the map was more intense (more touches) for 
the  children  who  made  the  errors,  as  they  tried  to  zoom-out 
and –in to recognize streets.  It seems that children stick with 
the  game  better  making  interactions  with  the  areas  where 
interactions  were  designed.  Students  seem  to  take  a  more 
controlling  role  to  acquire  additional  information.  Data 
collected  from 
the  usability  questionnaire  reveal  more 
information regarding the user experiences in our app below.

In  general,  all  participants  from  two  age  groups  like  this 
app.  Students  liked  this  app  mostly  because  they  felt  it  was 
intuitive  and  easy  to  follow  the  instructions.  Besides  similar 
reasons stated by children, they also explicitly stated that they 
liked this app because they had to orient themselves using the 
information provided in the app. Furthermore, all participants 
indicated that they would use this app for courses and leisure. 
Without further elaboration of students, some children stated 
that  they  particularly  like  using  it  for  leisure  to  explore 
unknown  areas.  However,  the  usability  data  also  show 
differences  between  children  and  students.  As  sound  effects 
were  designed  in  this  app  to  provide  participants  feedbacks, 
children  particularly  like  the  sound  effect.  But  the  students 
indicated that they felt the sound effect was annoying or not 
adjustable. While the game design seems to pleasure children, 
many students suggested removing the sound effect. Another 
major  difference  is  that  students  indicated  the  access  to  all 
instructions  before  the  experiments.  But  children  didn’t 
request any change to the accessibility of instructions but used 
the app as the way it was designed. Another small difference

Abstract 

Fostering spatial competencies of children has been positively discussed across disciplines and institutes. As  most  exiting tools for spatial 
learning are based on existing software such as geographic information systems, these tools may not be suitable for children at the age of 8 to 
12. With this goal in mind, we designed the Orientation Gaming App (Ori-Gami) fostering the development of spatial competencies and spatial 
learning of children in a gaming scenario. Children only need to follow intuitive instructions combined with visual and auditive hints given by 
the  app  to  complete  the  game  in  an  outdoor  environment.  Throughout  the  process,  children  engage  in  activities  involving  essential  spatial 
competencies such as map learning, orientation, and wayfinding. This paper presents the concept, design and usability tests of Ori-Gami used by 
both  children  and  adult  students.  Results  confirm  our  principles  of  designing  a  tool  specifically  for  children  to  foster  their  development  of 
essential spatial competencies such as orientation, wayfinding and map understanding.

Introduction 

What  children  learn  in  school  forms  the  basis  for  their 
approach to society and to science. To foster the role of spatial 
information  in  society  and  to  support  the  development  of 
spatial skills and competences it is important to point learners 
early on to the transdisciplinary power of spatial information 
and spatial thinking. When Goodchild coined a spatial literacy 
to appear in the curricula and in education on the same level 
as a mathematical and linguistic literacy [1] he was speaking 
about a transdisciplinary competence to think spatially in all 
subjects: from STEM1, to social sciences and arts. The NRC 
report  “Learning  to  think  spatially”  was  leading  into  this 
direction and presented solutions for Geographic Information 
Systems  (GIS)  as  a  support  system  to  think  spatially  [2]. 
Minimal GIS approaches for all grade levels at school, when 
particular  spatial  concepts  were  incidentally  used,  followed 
this direction in several studies [3-5]. 

In our Geospatial Learning project, we develop software to 
support spatial thinking by following the known principles to 
foster  orientation,  wayfinding  and  map  understanding  skills. 
We  combine  them  with  user-centered  design,  game-based 
learning,  and  situated  computing  and  evaluate  our  software 
with  different  usability  and  spatial  competence  tests.  Our 
applications concentrate on the targeted group at the age of 8 
to  12,  following  the  developmental  stage  [6,  7]  and  its 
representation  in  most  curricula  [8,  9].  The  applications 
developed  within  this  project  are  following  the  curricular 
requirements 
practical 
requirements,  since  schools  do  not  concentrate  on  outdoor 
activities  for  classes  of  geography  [10,  p.  74]  where  spatial 
competencies can be fostered.

In  this  paper  we  present  our  app  “Ori-Gami”  (Orientation 
Gaming), which is a game to support children to enhance their 
map  understanding,  orientation  and  wayfinding  skills,  and 
explain  the  educational  background  of  this  game.  Usability 
and  user  satisfaction  is  a  key  factor  for  the  success  of 
educational  games.  Thus,  this  paper  describes  the  concept, 
design  and  usability-test  of  Ori-Gami.  Section  2  gives  an 
overview of related initiatives working on spatial thinking and 
spatial learning. In section 3, we describe our app and explain 
the  educational  motivation  behind  the  game.  Section  4 
presents  the  design  and  discusses  the  results  of  the  usability 
study. Section 5 concludes the paper by outlining implications 
from  the  usability  study  for  the  development  of  focused 
spatial learning apps and directions for future work. 

 
 
2  Related Work 

Numerous researchers worked on supporting spatial thinking 
and  competency  development.  These  topics  have  been  the 
focus of several recent and distinctive academic initiatives and 
programs  around  the  globe  (e.g.  SILC2,  spatial@uscb3, 
LENS4, CSISS5, SPLINT6) and have been picked as a central 
theme  at  an  NRC  specialist  meeting  in  the  United  States 
documented  in  the  NRC-Report  Learning  to  think  Spatially 
[11]. In the following, we review recent activities from a GI 
Science perspective.

The  main  goal  of  the  “Spatial  Intelligence  and  Learning 
Center”  (SILC)  is  the  understanding  of  spatial  learning  and 
using  this  knowledge  to  produce  course  specific  software  to 
support  spatial  skills.  SILC  participants  include  researchers 
from  cognitive  science,  psychology,  computer  science, 
education,  and  neuroscience,  as  well  as  practicing 
geoscientists and engineers who are particularly interested in 
spatial thinking in their fields.  

Spatial@ucsb  is  a  research  center  at  the  University  of 
California,  Santa  Barbara.  Its  mission  is  to  facilitate  the 
integration of spatial thinking into processes for learning and 
discovery  in  the  natural,  social,  and  behavioral  sciences,  to 
promote excellence in engineering and applied sciences, and 
to enhance creativity in the arts and humanities. Spatial@ucsb 
also is promoting the development of spatial analytic tools. 

LEarNing  Spatially  (LENS)  is  an  initiative  promoting 
spatial  literacy  at  the  University  of  Redlands  working  on 
spatial thinking in school curricula and research. They define 
spatial  thinking  as  “the  ability  to  visualize  and  interpret 
location,  distance,  direction,  relationships,  movement  and 
change through space” [12]. They use geospatial technologies 
to  teach  a  critical  way  of  spatial  thinking  and  support 
geography  students  in  solving  spatial  problems,  visualizing 
results  and  interpreting  relationships  better  through  spatial 
technologies. 

The Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science (CSISS) 
at  the  University  of  Santa  Barbara  emphasizes  the  growing 
significance of spatial information in social science research. 
CSISS  supports unrestricted  access  to  tools  and  perspectives 
that  will  advance 
the  spatial  analytic  capabilities  of 
researchers throughout the social sciences. 

The  Spatial  Literacy  in  Teaching  (SPLINT)  Centre  of 
Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) is a consortium 
of  three  British  Universities  (Leicester,  Nottingham,  UCL) 
aiming to enhance the teaching and learning of spatial literacy 
focusing on geospatial technologies. 

Education  systems  all  over  the  world  start  integrating  the 
use  of  spatial  technologies  in  their  curricula  to  foster 
competences like spatial orientation – mostly in the geography 
context,  but  also  interdisciplinary  in  and  beyond  K-12  and 
undergraduate  studies  (i.e.  [13]).  However,  still  fundamental 
definitions on spatial thinking and interconnection of concepts 
in the related disciplines and communities are not established.

3  Ori-Gami and its Educational Concept 

3.1  The App 
Ori-Gami is an app for browsers or tablets. Depending on the 
platform  it  can  be  used  stationary  or  mobile  with  the  use  of 
GPS.  It  consists  of  a  simple  base  map  and  displays  route 
instructions of varying complexity (use of directions, cardinal 
directions, landmarks and distances) provided by a teacher, or 
game leader in an online editor. The user can either click on 
the  decision  points  described  in  the  verbal  instructions 
(browser version, Figure 1) or walk along the instructed path 
with the device (tablet version, Figure 2). 
Feedback, help and game elements allow the user to orientate 
and find reference points in the map and the real world. The 
blue dot in the map indicates the current position located by 
the  device  or  selected  by  the  user.  The  smiley  provides 
feedback  on  the  current  position:  It  changes  color  and 
friendliness  to  give  easy-to  understand  hints  whether  the 
player is moving into the direction of the next waypoint. Each 
time  the  player  reaches  a  waypoint,  the  app  signals  this  by 
playing  a  sound  and  visually  via  a  happy  smiley.  The  next 
wayfinding 
instructions  are  automatically  displayed.  A 
trumpet sound and a text at the end of a route gives the user 
feedback, that she has reached the goal.

3.2  The Educational Concept  
The  app 
fosters  spatial  competencies  such  as  map 
understanding,  orientation,  and  wayfinding  in  a  game-based 
learning style. 
Map understanding. The visualisation of the user’s position 
via GPS in the mobile version (Figure 2) is a major support in 
map  understanding.  Children  in  the  target  group  are  usually 
not able to locate themselves on a map, since it is difficult to 
connect 
spatial 
representation on a base map (where buildings are represented 
as polygons and streets as lines). The movement of the user’s 
representation  on  the  map  continuously  updated  by  the 
moving blue dot helps the user to create a representation and 
understand map concepts and symbols.  
Orientation. The available spatial representations in the map 
help  the  user  to  gain  survey  knowledge  of  her  environment. 
Together with the reference of her own position she is able to 
orientate herself and point to or walk into distinct directions.  
Wayfinding.  The  use  of  verbal  directions  during  an 
exploration task leads to accurate environmental learning [14] 
as 
to  construct  an  appropriate  spatial 
representation  from  the  verbal  directions  [15]  which  is 
essential for wayfinding. 
Game-Based Learning. By using several elements of digital 
game-based-learning  (DGBL)  in  the  app  design  (cf.  section 
3.1.) we try to motivate the users, while training their spatial 
competences  at  the  same  time.  DGBL  can  be  understood  as 
“any  marriage  of  educational  content  and  computer  games“ 
[15]. 
 
4  Usability Test 

the  user  needs 

 

The usability test investigates the usage performance and the 
subjective user satisfaction. As this is a usability test, we do 
not  examine  the  learning  success  with  respect  to  spatial 
competencies.  

4.1  Design 
The  tablet  version  of  the  Ori-Gami  App  is  used  for  the 
usability  test.  The  test  involves  two  phases:  In  phase  one, 
participants play the game on-site. The experimenter leads the 
participants  to  the  starting  point.  The  app  shows  the  first 
wayfinding  instruction.  The  participants  have  to  follow  each 
instruction until the smiley and the audio signal indicate that 
they reached the waypoint. We tested two alternative routes. 
The  system  automatically  switches  to  the  next  instruction  to 
follow. The tablet is equipped with GPS signal and tracks the 
route as well as the touch interactions on the display. 

In the second phase of the usability tests, participants have 
to complete a questionnaire, designed for this distinct project, 
with a focus on the map-based application. Questions one to 
four refer to their previous experience with paper and digital 
maps,  with  tablets  and  the  familiarity  with  the  environment. 
They  required  a  yes/no  response  and  offered  a  text  field  for 
further  details  if  the  question  was  answered  with  yes. 
Questions five to seven refer to the subjective user satisfaction 
where participants indicate their agreement. In questions eight 
to  thirteen,  participants  are  asked  to  for  feedback  to  outline 
problems,  report  on  their  experience  with  the  app  and  give 

 

 

 

suggestions  for  improvement.  These  were  open  question. 
Figure 3 lists the questions asked in the usability test. 

Figure 3: Questions in the Usability Questionnaire. 

 
Questionnaire: 
1. Did you use a paper map to search for a location before? 
2. Did you try to orient yourself with a map at an unfamiliar place 
before? 
3.  Did  you  work  with  a  map  (such  as  GoogleMaps/Earth)  on  a 
computer or a notebook before? 
4. Did you work with a map on a tablet or iPad before? 
 
5. Did you like working with our app? 
6. Would you like to use such an app in in the lectures? 
7. Would you like to play such a game in your leisure time?  
 
8. What did you like about this app? 
9. What did you not like about this app? 
10. What was particularly easy for you? 
11. What was particularly difficult for you? 
12. Was there anything you did not understand? 
13. Do you have any ideas to improve the app? 
 
The  usability  of  the  software  was  tested  with  two  user 
groups: a group of 9 geoinformatics students (age M 24.5, SD 
4.4) and a target group of 12 ten-year old children of a local 
school.  The  first  group  includes  experts  in  geoinformatics 
with  high-developed  spatial  competencies  and  experience  as 
indicated by the first four statements in the questionnaire. The 
second group is assumed to have lower spatial competencies 
(as  they  are  still  to  be  trained  according  to  educational 
guidelines),  but  they  have  very  good  knowledge  of  the 
environment, since the game took place in the surroundings of 
their school. 

4.2  Results and Discussion 
The  location  of  the  participant  during  the  experiment  was 
recorded  while  navigating  via  the  integrated  GPS-receiver. 
The  participants  from  both  age  groups  walked  similar 
distances  on  both  routes.  A  significant  difference  could  be 
found in the average walking speed, as the children user group 
was  walking  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  4  km/h,  the 
older  user  group  with  an  average  speed  of  approx.  6  km/h. 
This  may  be  a  general  manner  of  different  walking  speed, 
another reason could be, that the younger group did not feel 
comfortable to walk with a tablet device and constantly look 
at  the  device  and  their  surroundings.  On  both  routes  two 
children  made  an  error  in  following  the  instructions,  which 
concluded in a longer walking distance of 20-40m. The error 
was taking a wrong direction on a decision point (crossing) or 
just missing a decision point by walking to far (Figure 4). The 
errors were found in different locations. The older participants 
did  not  make  any  errors  and  followed  the  route  instructions 
very  quickly.  A  reason  for  that  may  be  their well-developed 
spatial  competences  as  map  understanding  and  orientation. 
They  could

knowledge about the environment.

(Figure  5)  shows  that  children  and  students  performed  very 
distinctive interactions with the app on the tablet. Children in 
this experiment mostly touched the map area in the app during 
the experiment. But students touched also the area where the 
instructions  were  given.  In  follow-up  interviews  with  the 
student  participants  they  explained  that  they  touched  the 
instruction  areas  with  the  intention  to  learn  follow-up 
instruction  in  order  to  grasp  an  overview  of  this  task.  The 
interaction with the map was more intense (more touches) for 
the  children  who  made  the  errors,  as  they  tried  to  zoom-out 
and –in to recognize streets.  It seems that children stick with 
the  game  better  making  interactions  with  the  areas  where 
interactions  were  designed.  Students  seem  to  take  a  more 
controlling  role  to  acquire  additional  information.  Data 
collected  from 
the  usability  questionnaire  reveal  more 
information regarding the user experiences in our app below.

In  general,  all  participants  from  two  age  groups  like  this 
app.  Students  liked  this  app  mostly  because  they  felt  it  was 
intuitive  and  easy  to  follow  the  instructions.  Besides  similar 
reasons stated by children, they also explicitly stated that they 
liked this app because they had to orient themselves using the 
information provided in the app. Furthermore, all participants 
indicated that they would use this app for courses and leisure. 
Without further elaboration of students, some children stated 
that  they  particularly  like  using  it  for  leisure  to  explore 
unknown  areas.  However,  the  usability  data  also  show 
differences  between  children  and  students.  As  sound  effects 
were  designed  in  this  app  to  provide  participants  feedbacks, 
children  particularly  like  the  sound  effect.  But  the  students 
indicated that they felt the sound effect was annoying or not 
adjustable. While the game design seems to pleasure children, 
many students suggested removing the sound effect. Another 
major  difference  is  that  students  indicated  the  access  to  all 
instructions  before  the  experiments.  But  children  didn’t 
request any change to the accessibility of instructions but used 
the app as the way it was designed. Another small difference 
is  participant’s  experience  working  with  tablet  maps.  While 
all students have used tablet maps before, only a small portion 

 

 
 

The  interactions  between  participants  and  the  app  such  as 
zooming  and  panning  were  recorded  during  the  experiment. 
There  were  no  additional  instructions  needed  for  the  map 
interaction  as  feedbacks  and  instructions  were  provided 
automatically according to the participant’s location. First of 
all,  the  interaction  between  participants  and  the  app  was 
effective  as  all  participants  completed  this  experiment  in 
reasonable  time.  Secondly,  the  heat  maps  of  interaction 

 

AGILE 2013 – Leuven, May 14-17, 2013 

of  children  had  this  experience.  These  differences  show  that 
the  features  designed  in  this  app  attract  children  to  fully 
engage  in  this  game.  Three  of  the  four  children  who  made 
errors indicated suggestions for the improvement of the app, 
mainly  a  help  or  feedback  mechanism  warning  if  one  is 
walking in the wrong direction.  

 
5  Conclusions and Future Work 

Following 
the  principle  of  fostering  children’s  spatial 
competencies including map reading, orientation, wayfinding, 
we  designed  this  Ori-Gami  app  and  tested  its  usability  with 
both  children  and  adult  students.  The  comparison  between 
children  and  students  help  us  confirm  our  design  specially 
aiming at children. Children in our usability test did not show 
difficulty  using  this  app  even  though  they  had  limited 
experiences using tablet maps. The longer time taken by them 
indicated  the  children  engaged  in  our  designed  components 
such  as  instruction  following,  map  learning,  orientation,  and 
navigation.  Game  based  learning  serves  as  a  promising 
method  in  our  test  for  children  to  learn  essential  spatial 
competencies.  While  students,  who  have  developed  much 
more spatial competencies than children over time, intend to 
acquire  more 
judgment  or 
validation,  children  in  this  test  followed  our  designed 
procedure  very  well.  This  usability 
the 
promising  effect  of  design  intuitive  and  engaging  game  for 
fostering the development of children’s spatial competencies. 
Future  work  will  concentrate  on  the  role  of  the  map  (a  map 
solution  designed  for  children’s  needs  concerning  scale, 
resolution and symbols is planned) and on understanding the 
learning  impact,  the  role  of  map/mental  rotation  and  the 
differences  between  indoor  and  outdoor  use  are  of  main 
interest.
