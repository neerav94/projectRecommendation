Abstract—  This  paper  aims  to  provoke  innovative  iPhone  app 
ideas  while  discouraging  those  that  are  already  flooding  the 
Apple  App  Store.  It  also  discusses  methods  for  generating 
revenue and gaining app  publicity. By taking a  close look at the 
iPhone’s capabilities, and examining already-successful apps, we 
see  how  an  app  can  be  unique,  intriguing,  popular,  or  just 
downright  useful.  Furthermore,  through  market  analysis,  we 
suggest areas of the app market that are worth investing in. 
We  also  discuss  effective  ways  of  making  money  (depending  on 
the  app  and  its  clientele).  Lastly,  we  stress  the  importance  of 
viral promoting in order to boost app publicity. 
 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Since 

the  2008 

release  of  Apple 

Inc.’s  Software 
Development  Kit  (SDK)  for  the  iPhone’s  mobile  operating 
system  (iOS),  third  party  developers  have  been  ruthlessly 
making  applications  (apps)  for  the  iPhone,  and  distributing 
them through the Apple App Store in hope of profit [1].  As an 
online marketplace, the Apple App Store allows developers to 
release  their  product  for  download,  and  obtain  a  share  of 
money  made  from  customer  purchases.    With  the  iPhone 
being one of the world’s most popular smartphones, there is a 
huge  pool  of  potential  customers  among  the  store,  which 
offers  developers  the  possibility  of  massive  profits,  that  is,  if 
their app is marketed correctly.   

While  Apple  has  done  an  amazing  job  supporting  the 
developer community with the tools necessary to make an app, 
the  iPhone  SDK  is  almost  so  simple  that  anyone  with  a 
programming  background  can  publish  an  app  to  the  Apple 
App  Store.    Due  to  this  accessibility,  many  opportunistic 
developers  have  been  taking  a  shot  towards  creating  the  app 
market’s next bestseller, which has caused a rapid increase of 
incoming apps.  While the store only opened with 500 apps or 
so  in  July  2008,  according  to  a  2012  Apple  Announcement, 
there  are  now  over  500,000  apps  on  the  market.    That  being 
said,  competition  for  app  publicity  has  never  been  fiercer.  
There  are  far  too  many  novice  developers  publishing  apps 
without  realizing  the  chances  of  actually  gaining  a  profit.  
John  Martellaro,  a  writer  for  MacObserver.com,  had  an 
analogy  for  developers  venturing  into  the  Apple  app  market: 
that like the Klondike Gold Rush, “only a few get really rich” 
[5].      With  so  many  apps  on  floating  around,  developers  are 
constantly asking: what kind of apps will thrive on the market?  

Perhaps  an  equally  important  question  is,  how  will  the  app 
gain the popularity to become a commercial success? 

II.  DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

to  avoid  being 

Planning ahead (before initiating development) is crucial in 
today’s  overflowing  app  market.  There  are  far  too  many 
amateur  developers  out  there  who  immediately  start  on  a 
project  thinking  it  will  become  a  bestseller.  Such  a  narrow 
fixation  on  their  own  project—without  really  doing  their 
homework—has  led  to  the  build-up  of  so  many  apps.    If  a 
developer  wants 
in  anguish  and 
disappointment  from  a  failing  app,  they  need  to  highly 
consider  what  they  will  deliver.    Most  likely,  an  idea  for  an 
app  has  already  been  done;  therefore  finding  uniqueness  is 
important  for  avoiding  unnecessary  competition.    Yet  in  the 
end,  any  app 
is  published  will  usually  share 
functionalities  similar  to  those  all  over  the  app  market,  so  it 
could  just  come  down  to  making  the  functionality  superior.   
In  any  matter,  those  who  have  been  smarter,  and  have  taken 
the  time  to  spot  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  have  a  higher 
chance of app market success.

A.  Diffusing Misconceptions 

Some  developers  may  think  that  the  only  way  to  make  a 
successful app is to mimic the highly downloaded apps on the 
“Top”  lists.    The  “Top”  lists  on  the  Apple  App  Store  are  a 
ranking  of  popular  apps  which  many  iPhone  users  browse 
(when  on  the  hunt  for  a  new  app).    While  referring  to  these 
lists may seem like a good way to see what is in demand, there 
is skepticism as to what kind of apps land on the “Top” lists.   
According  to  app  developer  Marco  Arment,  the  App 
Store’s “Top” lists are usually just for simple, “shallow” apps 
that come and go quickly [4].   Arment suggests that the App 
Store’s  “Top”  lists  only  portray  a  segment  of  the  apps  in 
demand, and that elsewhere, there exist apps that also do well 
on  the  market  (but  aren’t  labeled  among  the  “Top”)  [4].    He 
explains  that  his  app,  “Instapaper,”  (an  app  for  reading  web 
pages)  finds  itself  far  from  the  “Top”  lists,  but  still  does

that can be successful, without catering to the clientele of the

A.  Utilizing iPhone Technology 

When  considering  an  idea  for  an  application,  it’s  always 
important  to  realize  the  unique  physical  and  programmatic 
features of the iPhone.  The iPhone provides some exceptional 
technology as a platform, which can be used in an app for an 
innovative advantage.

Developers have found clever ways to use the satellite-sent 
Geolocation data, which provides pinpoint map coordinates to 
the  device.  Whether  it  be  a  social  networking  app  that  tags  a 
friend’s  location,  or  a  running  app  that  tracks  a  users  exact 
route  and  distance, 
is  being 
intelligently incorporated into the functionality of many apps.  
For example,  the popular “RunKeeper” app uses Geolocation 
data  to  record  a  runner’s  route  on  live  maps  so  that  the  user 
can see not only where they’ve ran, but also how many miles 
they’ve covered.

Developers  have  also  utilized 

the  gyroscope  and 
accelerometer  for  its  orientation-aware  technology.    With  a 
gyroscope  that  detects  the  device’s  angular  rotation,  and  an 
accelerometer 
linear  motion, 
developers  have  made  a  variety  of  stunning  apps  using  the 
physical  movements  of  the  phone.    While  mostly  games  and 
entertainment  apps  tend  to  make  use  of  these  features  for  an 
interactive  experience,  any  kind  of  app  can  use  the  motion-
tech for a unique approach.

Another  piece  of  tech  worth  considering  is  the  iPhone’s 
high  quality  built-in  camera,  which  captures  exceptionally 
sharp images and video for a mobile phone.   Some developers 
have  made  apps  that  use  the  camera  as  a  barcode  scanner.  
Even  more  complex  is  the  “Google  Goggles”  app  which  has 
the ability to make a relevant Google image search based on a 
captured  photo  (i.e.  it  will  recognize  the  content  of  a  photo, 
whether  it  be  a  landmark,  a  book,  a  logo,  etc.).    While  these 
apps  make  use  of  the  camera,  it’s  also  important  to  note  that 
their  functionality  relies  on  a  constant  internet  connection  in 
order to search the web.   

The  popular  “Instagram”  app  also  uses  the  camera,  which 
lets users add a retro-style  filter to their photos, and instantly 
share them over a social network.  While there are many apps 
that  allow  a  user  to  edit  photos  with  filters,  focal  points,  or 
effects, “Instagram” finds success by additionally plugging in 
with internet.  

Aside from camera usage, apps like  “Google Glasses” and 
“Instagram”  tell  us  that  internet  usage  should  be  utilized 
whenever it can in an app to span its functionality.  As shown 
with  the  rapid  success  of  “Instagram,”  using  the  internet  for 
social interaction in the use of apps has proved to be effective 
in  gaining  popularity.    This  is  because  users  are  interacting

people.      Take  the  “Words  With  Friends”  app  for  example, 
which  is  just  a  mobile  version  of  the  iconic  Scrabble  board 
game.  How is it that with all the next-gen, complex games out 
there, the classic board game  can rank supreme?  It is due  to 
the  social  aspect  of  the  game,  where  users  must  start  a  game 
with  a  friend,  and  play  over  their  iPhones.  Apps  that  offer 
social  exchange  can  make  the  app  seem  refreshing  and  ever-
changing due to the human input.  

III.    MARKET ANALYSIS 

Attaining  app  market 

insight  can  be  helpful  before 
venturing into development.  As of 2012 analysts estimate that 
the  mobile  app  market  has  generated  over  $4  billion  [2],  but 
where  is  all  this  money  going?    By  examining  Apple  App 
Store  statistics,  developers  can  see  what  kind  of  apps  iPhone 
users  are  downloading,  and  realize  what  kind  of  apps  are  in 
demand.    Such  information  can  help  developers  attack  the 
market  in  the  right  areas  for  greater  chances  of  app  market 
success.   

A.  Looking at Categories 

In  the  Apple  App  Store,  every  app  is  labeled  under  a 
category  such  as  games,  books,  entertainment,  lifestyle, 
utilities,  etc.    Some  categories  receive  more  downloads  than 
others. 

As shown in Fig. 3, games are being downloaded the most 
by  iPhone  users.  Yet,  this  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  this  is  a 
good  spot  to  invest  development.    Recall  the  Klondike  Gold 
Rush analogy, where only a few get really rich.  The massive 
amount  of  downloads  (for  games)  are  most  likely  only 
heading  to  a  few  game  apps,  rather  than  the  entire  collection 
of game apps available.   That being said, although games  
 

 

 
Fig.  3      Pie  chart  shows  the  category  proportions  for  total  downloads  in  the 
Apple App Store.  Percentages are from 4/1/2011  [3]. 
 
receive a lot of downloads, it’s a risky place to deliver an app 
because experienced companies and teams are dominating that 
area  of  the  market,  leaving  smaller  game  developers  little 
chance  of  receiving  downloads.    Zynga,  a  company  that 
develops game apps that work with social networks, has over 
400  employees  and  around  20  games  on  the  app  market  [2].  
With  the  downloads  and  purchases  they  receive  from  their 
apps,  they  pull  in  a  nine-figure  revenue  every  year  [2].  
Powerful  companies  such  as  Zynga  make  the  competition 
fierce in the games category.  The crowded game  market has 
evolved  to  the  point  where  now,  only  teams  and  companies 
have  a  real  shot  at  making  a  popular  game.    Luckily,  there 
may be other categorical areas where the competition is lower, 
and the category hasn’t become overcrowded yet.   

Looking at Fig. 4, we can see how the downloads of certain 
categories  (lifestyle,  games,  entertainment,  education,  and 
books) have increased or decreased overtime.   In orange, the

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Since 

the  2008 

release  of  Apple 

Inc.’s  Software 
Development  Kit  (SDK)  for  the  iPhone’s  mobile  operating 
system  (iOS),  third  party  developers  have  been  ruthlessly 
making  applications  (apps)  for  the  iPhone,  and  distributing 
them through the Apple App Store in hope of profit [1].  As an 
online marketplace, the Apple App Store allows developers to 
release  their  product  for  download,  and  obtain  a  share  of 
money  made  from  customer  purchases.    With  the  iPhone 
being one of the world’s most popular smartphones, there is a 
huge  pool  of  potential  customers  among  the  store,  which 
offers  developers  the  possibility  of  massive  profits,  that  is,  if 
their app is marketed correctly.   

While  Apple  has  done  an  amazing  job  supporting  the 
developer community with the tools necessary to make an app, 
the  iPhone  SDK  is  almost  so  simple  that  anyone  with  a 
programming  background  can  publish  an  app  to  the  Apple 
App  Store.    Due  to  this  accessibility,  many  opportunistic 
developers  have  been  taking  a  shot  towards  creating  the  app 
market’s next bestseller, which has caused a rapid increase of 
incoming apps.  While the store only opened with 500 apps or 
so  in  July  2008,  according  to  a  2012  Apple  Announcement, 
there  are  now  over  500,000  apps  on  the  market.    That  being 
said,  competition  for  app  publicity  has  never  been  fiercer.  
There  are  far  too  many  novice  developers  publishing  apps 
without  realizing  the  chances  of  actually  gaining  a  profit.  
John  Martellaro,  a  writer  for  MacObserver.com,  had  an 
analogy  for  developers  venturing  into  the  Apple  app  market: 
that like the Klondike Gold Rush, “only a few get really rich” 
[5].      With  so  many  apps  on  floating  around,  developers  are 
constantly asking: what kind of apps will thrive on the market?  

Perhaps  an  equally  important  question  is,  how  will  the  app 
gain the popularity to become a commercial success? 

II.  DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

to  avoid  being 

Planning ahead (before initiating development) is crucial in 
today’s  overflowing  app  market.  There  are  far  too  many 
amateur  developers  out  there  who  immediately  start  on  a 
project  thinking  it  will  become  a  bestseller.  Such  a  narrow 
fixation  on  their  own  project—without  really  doing  their 
homework—has  led  to  the  build-up  of  so  many  apps.    If  a 
developer  wants 
in  anguish  and 
disappointment  from  a  failing  app,  they  need  to  highly 
consider  what  they  will  deliver.    Most  likely,  an  idea  for  an 
app  has  already  been  done;  therefore  finding  uniqueness  is 
important  for  avoiding  unnecessary  competition.    Yet  in  the 
end,  any  app 
is  published  will  usually  share 
functionalities  similar  to  those  all  over  the  app  market,  so  it 
could  just  come  down  to  making  the  functionality  superior.   
In  any  matter,  those  who  have  been  smarter,  and  have  taken 
the  time  to  spot  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  have  a  higher 
chance of app market success.      

that 

left 

A.  Diffusing Misconceptions 

Some  developers  may  think  that  the  only  way  to  make  a 
successful app is to mimic the highly downloaded apps on the 
“Top”  lists.    The  “Top”  lists  on  the  Apple  App  Store  are  a 
ranking  of  popular  apps  which  many  iPhone  users  browse 
(when  on  the  hunt  for  a  new  app).    While  referring  to  these 
lists may seem like a good way to see what is in demand, there 
is skepticism as to what kind of apps land on the “Top” lists.   
According  to  app  developer  Marco  Arment,  the  App 
Store’s “Top” lists are usually just for simple, “shallow” apps 
that come and go quickly [4].   Arment suggests that the App 
Store’s  “Top”  lists  only  portray  a  segment  of  the  apps  in 
demand, and that elsewhere, there exist apps that also do well 
on  the  market  (but  aren’t  labeled  among  the  “Top”)  [4].    He 
explains  that  his  app,  “Instapaper,”  (an  app  for  reading  web 
pages)  finds  itself  far  from  the  “Top”  lists,  but  still  does 
successful  in  an  alternate  market  of  clientele  that  demands 
complex, more thoroughly-developed apps that are maintained 
[4].    So  although  the  kind-of  apps  found  on  the  “Top”  lists 
offer quick  market success, there are still other types of  apps 
that can be successful, without catering to the clientele of the 

“Top”  lists.    That  being  said,  while  app  developers  should 
review  the  “Top”  lists  for  market  insight,  they  shouldn’t  let 
the “Top” lists sway their development. 

A.  Utilizing iPhone Technology 

When  considering  an  idea  for  an  application,  it’s  always 
important  to  realize  the  unique  physical  and  programmatic 
features of the iPhone.  The iPhone provides some exceptional 
technology as a platform, which can be used in an app for an 
innovative advantage.

Developers have found clever ways to use the satellite-sent 
Geolocation data, which provides pinpoint map coordinates to 
the  device.  Whether  it  be  a  social  networking  app  that  tags  a 
friend’s  location,  or  a  running  app  that  tracks  a  users  exact 
route  and  distance, 
is  being 
intelligently incorporated into the functionality of many apps.  
For example,  the popular “RunKeeper” app uses Geolocation 
data  to  record  a  runner’s  route  on  live  maps  so  that  the  user 
can see not only where they’ve ran, but also how many miles 
they’ve covered.

the  gyroscope  and

gyroscope  that  detects  the  device’s  angular  rotation,  and  an 
accelerometer 
linear  motion, 
developers  have  made  a  variety  of  stunning  apps  using  the 
physical  movements  of  the  phone.    While  mostly  games  and 
entertainment  apps  tend  to  make  use  of  these  features  for  an 
interactive  experience,  any  kind  of  app  can  use  the  motion-
tech for a unique approach.

car (by tilting the devices yaw) [10] 
 
 

Another  piece  of  tech  worth  considering  is  the  iPhone’s 
high  quality  built-in  camera,  which  captures  exceptionally 
sharp images and video for a mobile phone.   Some developers 
have  made  apps  that  use  the  camera  as  a  barcode  scanner.  
Even  more  complex  is  the  “Google  Goggles”  app  which  has 
the ability to make a relevant Google image search based on a 
captured  photo  (i.e.  it  will  recognize  the  content  of  a  photo, 
whether  it  be  a  landmark,  a  book,  a  logo,  etc.).    While  these 
apps  make  use  of  the  camera,  it’s  also  important  to  note  that 
their  functionality  relies  on  a  constant  internet  connection  in 
order to search the web.   

The  popular  “Instagram”  app  also  uses  the  camera,  which 
lets users add a retro-style  filter to their photos, and instantly 
share them over a social network.  While there are many apps 
that  allow  a  user  to  edit  photos  with  filters,  focal  points,  or 
effects, “Instagram” finds success by additionally plugging in 
with internet.  

Aside from camera usage, apps like  “Google Glasses” and 
“Instagram”  tell  us  that  internet  usage  should  be  utilized 
whenever it can in an app to span its functionality.  As shown 
with  the  rapid  success  of  “Instagram,”  using  the  internet  for 
social interaction in the use of apps has proved to be effective 
in  gaining  popularity.    This  is  because  users  are  interacting 

with other people, which compel them to keep using the app.  
After all, being social is what makes us human.  Apps can feel 
more  important  when  they  are  actually  interacting  with  real 
people.      Take  the  “Words  With  Friends”  app  for  example, 
which  is  just  a  mobile  version  of  the  iconic  Scrabble  board 
game.  How is it that with all the next-gen, complex games out 
there, the classic board game  can rank supreme?  It is due  to 
the  social  aspect  of  the  game,  where  users  must  start  a  game 
with  a  friend,  and  play  over  their  iPhones.  Apps  that  offer 
social  exchange  can  make  the  app  seem  refreshing  and  ever-
changing due to the human input.  

III.    MARKET ANALYSIS 

Attaining  app  market 

insight  can  be  helpful  before 
venturing into development.  As of 2012 analysts estimate that 
the  mobile  app  market  has  generated  over  $4  billion  [2],  but 
where  is  all  this  money  going?    By  examining  Apple  App 
Store  statistics,  developers  can  see  what  kind  of  apps  iPhone 
users  are  downloading,  and  realize  what  kind  of  apps  are  in 
demand.    Such  information  can  help  developers  attack  the 
market  in  the  right  areas  for  greater  chances  of  app  market 
success.

Fig.  3      Pie  chart  shows  the  category  proportions  for  total  downloads  in  the 
Apple App Store.  Percentages are from 4/1/2011  [3]. 
 
receive a lot of downloads, it’s a risky place to deliver an app 
because experienced companies and teams are dominating that 
area  of  the  market,  leaving  smaller  game  developers  little 
chance  of  receiving  downloads.    Zynga,  a  company  that 
develops game apps that work with social networks, has over 
400  employees  and  around  20  games  on  the  app  market  [2].  
With  the  downloads  and  purchases  they  receive  from  their 
apps,  they  pull  in  a  nine-figure  revenue  every  year  [2].  
Powerful  companies  such  as  Zynga  make  the  competition 
fierce in the games category.  The crowded game  market has 
evolved  to  the  point  where  now,  only  teams  and  companies 
have  a  real  shot  at  making  a  popular  game.    Luckily,  there 
may be other categorical areas where the competition is lower, 
and the category hasn’t become overcrowded yet.   

Looking at Fig. 4, we can see how the downloads of certain 
categories  (lifestyle,  games,  entertainment,  education,  and 
books) have increased or decreased overtime.   In orange, the 

Fig. 4   App Category distribution (ranked by download) over a span of about three years (2008 – 2011) 
in the Apple App Store [3].  Note:  the gray portion consists of all other app categories not mentioned in 
the graph. 

games  category  has  remained  as  the  majority,  but  has 
diminished  from  24%  to  15%  over  time.    In  contrast,  the 
lifestyle category (in purple) only started at 4%, but has had a 
substantial rise to 7% over time.  The education category also 
shared this increase, going from 3% to 8% overtime. 

While it  may  not  seem like  much, relative  to the size they 
started  at,  lifestyle  and  education  apps  have  had  a  significant 
increase  in  downloads.    This  suggests  that  apps  that  are 
considered “useful” or aid productivity are being downloaded 
more and more [3]. Therefore, developers should cultivate this 
area of the market, not only because it is rising in demand, but 
because it also less crowded.   

IV.    GENERATING REVENUE 

Making  a  profit  can  seem  daunting  given  the  low  price  of 
apps in the Apple App Store.  In today’s flooded app market, a 
certain  degree  of  time  and  money  must  be  invested  in  order 
for  an  app  to  gain  visibility,  but  with  most  apps  going  for 
$0.99,  it  can  be  difficult  to  outweigh  the  development  costs.  
According to developer Craig Hockenberry, some projects can 
cost thousands due to a software developer’s expensive labor 
[5].    In  one  situation,  he  explains  that  at  an  hourly  rate  of 
$150-200,  development  costs  can  come  out  to  $80,000  for  a 
three  month  project,  which  means  he’d  have  to  sell  115,000 
copies  at  99  cents  in  order  to  break  even  [5].    Although 
development  costs  will  vary,  a  buck  for  quality  software  can 
leave developers in debt.   

A.   Pricing 

shouldn’t  be,” 

and 

apps,  but  others 

Many developers feel that if they mark their product higher 
than the usual $0.99 price tag, then they’re app won’t receive 
as  many downloads, but Dan  Burcaw of Double Encore, Inc. 
disagrees.    He  explains  that  “some  apps  are  designed  to  be 
volume 
that 
“understanding  the  customer’s  needs  is  vital”  [5].    Burcaw 
believes that for some apps, customers will value the product 
if  the  price  is  higher.    In  one  case,  he  explains  how  a 
developer increased his app price from $0.99 to $1.99, and as 
a result, the app received more sales [5].  Take the educational 
periodic  table  app,  “The  Elements,”  for  example,  which  is 
priced  at  a  whopping  $6.99  on  the  Apple  App  Store.    The 
company  realizes 
their  potential  customers  value 
education,  so  in  order  for  the  app  to  be  taken  seriously  as  an 
educational  tool,  the  high  price  is  more  than  appropriate.  
Much  like  the  U.S.  college  textbooks  today,  although 
overpriced,  parents—will  without  a  question—buy  the  $150 
books because they value their child’s education. 

that 

B.   Additional Income Methods 

Of  course,  high  app  pricing  is  only  appropriate  for  certain 
kinds  of  apps,  so  if  raising  the  price  is  out  of  the  question, 
there are other ways of making money than just solely relying 
on  raw  app  sales.    Many  developers  are  making  additional 
revenue from selling digital goods used in apps [2].  Zynga’s 
popular  social  app  game  “FarmVille,”  in  which  users  grow 
digital  crops  and  sell  them  for  virtual  money,  is  a  prime 
example  of  an  app  that  sells  digital  goods  [2].    While  Zynga 
doesn’t charge users to play “FarmVille,” they do sell in-game 

digital  crops,  cattle,  and  farmland  for  real  money  [2].    For 
example, users can buy cor n  seeds at the cost of 10 cents, or 
even cows for 20 cents [2].  Although the charges seem tiny, 
they  can  really  add  up.    One  recent  digital  good  that  Zynga 
whipped  up—digital  sweet  potato  seeds  that  cost  $5  a 
packet—pulled  in  over  $400,000  in  its  first  three  days  [2].  
While  selling  in-app  digital  goods  may  seem  strange,  it  has 
the ability to retain users and increase revenues.  

 

 
Fig. 5   FarmVille’s in-game currency (for buying digital goods) is available 
for purchase with real money 
 

 

Another  way  to  make  money  is  from  ads  within  apps.  
AdMob,  for  instance,  is  a  service  by  Google  that  allows 
developers to monetize their  app by integrating ads into their 
app  [6].    It  works  so  that  once  the  ads  are  in  place,  the 
developer gets paid every time users clicks on ads in their app 
[6].  Whether it be intentional or just an accident, it’s easy for 
an  app  user  to  make  the  occasional  tap  on  an  advertisement.  
Since revenue from ads depends on the app’s traffic, some of 
the  more  popular  apps  have  made  hundreds  of  thousands  in 
AdMob revenue [9].  

V.     APP PUBLICITY 

Sure, a developer can have an awesome app, but in the end 
it’s  almost  worthless  if  people  can’t  find  it.    “The  sheer 
number of apps in the [Apple] App Store  make it difficult  to 
gain much visibility,” says developer Chuck Soper of the Vela 
Design  Group  [5].    Gaining  app  publicity  is  arguably  one  of 
the most important steps for success in the flooded app market.  
App developer Dan Burcaw, couldn’t agree more; he explains 
that  the  “real  battle  is  getting  eyeballs  on  the  product”  [5].  
Luckily, there are ways to do this. 

Having a  website that  not only shows off the functionality 
of the app but provides a direct link to the Apple App Store is 
a  necessity.    A  developer  can’t  just  rely  on  customers  to 
simply  stumble  upon  their  app  as  they  navigate,  unguided 
through the store [5].  Customers need ways of arriving to the 
product such as a direct link from the app’s website.  With the 
Apple  App  Store’s  limited  search  options,  it  can  be  hard  for 
customers  to  find  what  they’re  looking  for  through  the  store, 
but with efficient internet search engines like Google, finding

said,  competition  for  app  publicity  has  never  been  fiercer.  
There  are  far  too  many  novice  developers  publishing  apps 
without  realizing  the  chances  of  actually  gaining  a  profit.  
John  Martellaro,  a  writer  for  MacObserver.com,  had  an 
analogy  for  developers  venturing  into  the  Apple  app  market: 
that like the Klondike Gold Rush, “only a few get really rich” 
[5].      With  so  many  apps  on  floating  around,  developers  are 
constantly asking: what kind of apps will thrive on the market?  

Perhaps  an  equally  important  question  is,  how  will  the  app 
gain the popularity to become a commercial success? 

II.  DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

to  avoid  being 

Planning ahead (before initiating development) is crucial in 
today’s  overflowing  app  market.  There  are  far  too  many 
amateur  developers  out  there  who  immediately  start  on  a 
project  thinking  it  will  become  a  bestseller.  Such  a  narrow 
fixation  on  their  own  project—without  really  doing  their 
homework—has  led  to  the  build-up  of  so  many  apps.    If  a 
developer  wants 
in  anguish  and 
disappointment  from  a  failing  app,  they  need  to  highly 
consider  what  they  will  deliver.    Most  likely,  an  idea  for  an 
app  has  already  been  done;  therefore  finding  uniqueness  is 
important  for  avoiding  unnecessary  competition.    Yet  in  the 
end,  any  app 
is  published  will  usually  share 
functionalities  similar  to  those  all  over  the  app  market,  so  it 
could  just  come  down  to  making  the  functionality  superior.   
In  any  matter,  those  who  have  been  smarter,  and  have  taken 
the  time  to  spot  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  have  a  higher 
chance of app market success.      

that 

left 

A.  Diffusing Misconceptions 

Some  developers  may  think  that  the  only  way  to  make  a 
successful app is to mimic the highly downloaded apps on the 
“Top”  lists.    The  “Top”  lists  on  the  Apple  App  Store  are  a 
ranking  of  popular  apps  which  many  iPhone  users  browse 
(when  on  the  hunt  for  a  new  app).    While  referring  to  these 
lists may seem like a good way to see what is in demand, there 
is skepticism as to what kind of apps land on the “Top” lists.   
According  to  app  developer  Marco  Arment,  the  App 
Store’s “Top” lists are usually just for simple, “shallow” apps 
that come and go quickly [4].   Arment suggests that the App 
Store’s  “Top”  lists  only  portray  a  segment  of  the  apps  in 
demand, and that elsewhere, there exist apps that also do well 
on  the  market  (but  aren’t  labeled  among  the  “Top”)  [4].    He 
explains  that  his  app,  “Instapaper,”  (an  app  for  reading  web 
pages)  finds  itself  far  from  the  “Top”  lists,  but  still  does 
successful  in  an  alternate  market  of  clientele  that  demands 
complex, more thoroughly-developed apps that are maintained 
[4].    So  although  the  kind-of  apps  found  on  the  “Top”  lists 
offer quick  market success, there are still other types of  apps 
that can be successful, without catering to the clientele of the 

“Top”  lists.    That  being  said,  while  app  developers  should 
review  the  “Top”  lists  for  market  insight,  they  shouldn’t  let 
the “Top” lists sway their development. 

A.  Utilizing iPhone Technology 

When  considering  an  idea  for  an  application,  it’s  always 
important  to  realize  the  unique  physical  and  programmatic 
features of the iPhone.  The iPhone provides some exceptional 
technology as a platform, which can be used in an app for an 
innovative advantage.

Developers have found clever ways to use the satellite-sent 
Geolocation data, which provides pinpoint map coordinates to 
the  device.  Whether  it  be  a  social  networking  app  that  tags  a 
friend’s  location,  or  a  running  app  that  tracks  a  users  exact 
route  and  distance, 
is  being 
intelligently incorporated into the functionality of many apps.  
For example,  the popular “RunKeeper” app uses Geolocation 
data  to  record  a  runner’s  route  on  live  maps  so  that  the  user 
can see not only where they’ve ran, but also how many miles 
they’ve covered.

Developers  have  also  utilized 

the  gyroscope  and 
accelerometer  for  its  orientation-aware  technology.    With  a 
gyroscope  that  detects  the  device’s  angular  rotation,  and  an 
accelerometer 
linear  motion, 
developers  have  made  a  variety  of  stunning  apps  using  the 
physical  movements  of  the  phone.    While  mostly  games  and 
entertainment  apps  tend  to  make  use  of  these  features  for  an 
interactive  experience,  any  kind  of  app  can  use  the  motion-
tech for a unique approach.

Fig.  2      The popular  “Real  Racing” app uses  gyroscope  controls  to  steer  the 
car (by tilting the devices yaw) [10] 
 
 

Another  piece  of  tech  worth  considering  is  the  iPhone’s 
high  quality  built-in  camera,  which  captures  exceptionally 
sharp images and video for a mobile phone.   Some developers 
have  made  apps  that  use  the  camera  as  a  barcode  scanner.  
Even  more  complex  is  the  “Google  Goggles”  app  which  has 
the ability to make a relevant Google image search based on a 
captured  photo  (i.e.  it  will  recognize  the  content  of  a  photo, 
whether  it  be  a  landmark,  a  book,  a  logo,  etc.).    While  these 
apps  make  use  of  the  camera,  it’s  also  important  to  note  that 
their  functionality  relies  on  a  constant  internet  connection  in 
order to search the web.   

The  popular  “Instagram”  app  also  uses  the  camera,  which 
lets users add a retro-style  filter to their photos, and instantly 
share them over a social network.  While there are many apps 
that  allow  a  user  to  edit  photos  with  filters,  focal  points,  or 
effects, “Instagram” finds success by additionally plugging in 
with internet.  

Aside from camera usage, apps like  “Google Glasses” and 
“Instagram”  tell  us  that  internet  usage  should  be  utilized 
whenever it can in an app to span its functionality.  As shown 
with  the  rapid  success  of  “Instagram,”  using  the  internet  for 
social interaction in the use of apps has proved to be effective 
in  gaining  popularity.    This  is  because  users  are  interacting 

with other people, which compel them to keep using the app.  
After all, being social is what makes us human.  Apps can feel 
more  important  when  they  are  actually  interacting  with  real 
people.      Take  the  “Words  With  Friends”  app  for  example, 
which  is  just  a  mobile  version  of  the  iconic  Scrabble  board 
game.  How is it that with all the next-gen, complex games out 
there, the classic board game  can rank supreme?  It is due  to 
the  social  aspect  of  the  game,  where  users  must  start  a  game 
with  a  friend,  and  play  over  their  iPhones.  Apps  that  offer 
social  exchange  can  make  the  app  seem  refreshing  and  ever-
changing due to the human input.  

III.    MARKET ANALYSIS 

Attaining  app  market 

insight  can  be  helpful  before 
venturing into development.  As of 2012 analysts estimate that 
the  mobile  app  market  has  generated  over  $4  billion  [2],  but 
where  is  all  this  money  going?    By  examining  Apple  App 
Store  statistics,  developers  can  see  what  kind  of  apps  iPhone 
users  are  downloading,  and  realize  what  kind  of  apps  are  in 
demand.    Such  information  can  help  developers  attack  the 
market  in  the  right  areas  for  greater  chances  of  app  market 
success.   

A.  Looking at Categories 

In  the  Apple  App  Store,  every  app  is  labeled  under  a 
category  such  as  games,  books,  entertainment,  lifestyle, 
utilities,  etc.    Some  categories  receive  more  downloads  than 
others. 

As shown in Fig. 3, games are being downloaded the most 
by  iPhone  users.  Yet,  this  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  this  is  a 
good  spot  to  invest  development.    Recall  the  Klondike  Gold 
Rush analogy, where only a few get really rich.  The massive 
amount  of  downloads  (for  games)  are  most  likely  only 
heading  to  a  few  game  apps,  rather  than  the  entire  collection 
of game apps available.   That being said, although games  
 

 

 
Fig.  3      Pie  chart  shows  the  category  proportions  for  total  downloads  in  the 
Apple App Store.  Percentages are from 4/1/2011  [3]. 
 
receive a lot of downloads, it’s a risky place to deliver an app 
because experienced companies and teams are dominating that 
area  of  the  market,  leaving  smaller  game  developers  little 
chance  of  receiving  downloads.    Zynga,  a  company  that 
develops game apps that work with social networks, has over 
400  employees  and  around  20  games  on  the  app  market  [2].  
With  the  downloads  and  purchases  they  receive  from  their 
apps,  they  pull  in  a  nine-figure  revenue  every  year  [2].  
Powerful  companies  such  as  Zynga  make  the  competition 
fierce in the games category.  The crowded game  market has 
evolved  to  the  point  where  now,  only  teams  and  companies 
have  a  real  shot  at  making  a  popular  game.    Luckily,  there 
may be other categorical areas where the competition is lower, 
and the category hasn’t become overcrowded yet.   

Looking at Fig. 4, we can see how the downloads of certain 
categories  (lifestyle,  games,  entertainment,  education,  and 
books) have increased or decreased overtime.   In orange, the 

Fig. 4   App Category distribution (ranked by download) over a span of about three years (2008 – 2011) 
in the Apple App Store [3].  Note:  the gray portion consists of all other app categories not mentioned in 
the graph. 

games  category  has  remained  as  the  majority,  but  has 
diminished  from  24%  to  15%  over  time.    In  contrast,  the 
lifestyle category (in purple) only started at 4%, but has had a 
substantial rise to 7% over time.  The education category also 
shared this increase, going from 3% to 8% overtime. 

While it  may  not  seem like  much, relative  to the size they 
started  at,  lifestyle  and  education  apps  have  had  a  significant 
increase  in  downloads.    This  suggests  that  apps  that  are 
considered “useful” or aid productivity are being downloaded 
more and more [3]. Therefore, developers should cultivate this 
area of the market, not only because it is rising in demand, but 
because it also less crowded.   

IV.    GENERATING REVENUE 

Making  a  profit  can  seem  daunting  given  the  low  price  of 
apps in the Apple App Store.  In today’s flooded app market, a 
certain  degree  of  time  and  money  must  be  invested  in  order 
for  an  app  to  gain  visibility,  but  with  most  apps  going  for 
$0.99,  it  can  be  difficult  to  outweigh  the  development  costs.  
According to developer Craig Hockenberry, some projects can 
cost thousands due to a software developer’s expensive labor 
[5].    In  one  situation,  he  explains  that  at  an  hourly  rate  of 
$150-200,  development  costs  can  come  out  to  $80,000  for  a 
three  month  project,  which  means  he’d  have  to  sell  115,000 
copies  at  99  cents  in  order  to  break  even  [5].    Although 
development  costs  will  vary,  a  buck  for  quality  software  can 
leave developers in debt.   

A.   Pricing 

shouldn’t  be,” 

and 

apps,  but  others 

Many developers feel that if they mark their product higher 
than the usual $0.99 price tag, then they’re app won’t receive 
as  many downloads, but Dan  Burcaw of Double Encore, Inc. 
disagrees.    He  explains  that  “some  apps  are  designed  to  be 
volume 
that 
“understanding  the  customer’s  needs  is  vital”  [5].    Burcaw 
believes that for some apps, customers will value the product 
if  the  price  is  higher.    In  one  case,  he  explains  how  a 
developer increased his app price from $0.99 to $1.99, and as 
a result, the app received more sales [5].  Take the educational 
periodic  table  app,  “The  Elements,”  for  example,  which  is 
priced  at  a  whopping  $6.99  on  the  Apple  App  Store.    The 
company  realizes 
their  potential  customers  value 
education,  so  in  order  for  the  app  to  be  taken  seriously  as  an 
educational  tool,  the  high  price  is  more  than  appropriate.  
Much  like  the  U.S.  college  textbooks  today,  although 
overpriced,  parents—will  without  a  question—buy  the  $150 
books because they value their child’s education. 

that 

B.   Additional Income Methods 

Of  course,  high  app  pricing  is  only  appropriate  for  certain 
kinds  of  apps,  so  if  raising  the  price  is  out  of  the  question, 
there are other ways of making money than just solely relying 
on  raw  app  sales.    Many  developers  are  making  additional 
revenue from selling digital goods used in apps [2].  Zynga’s 
popular  social  app  game  “FarmVille,”  in  which  users  grow 
digital  crops  and  sell  them  for  virtual  money,  is  a  prime 
example  of  an  app  that  sells  digital  goods  [2].    While  Zynga 
doesn’t charge users to play “FarmVille,” they do sell in-game 

digital  crops,  cattle,  and  farmland  for  real  money  [2].    For 
example, users can buy cor n  seeds at the cost of 10 cents, or 
even cows for 20 cents [2].  Although the charges seem tiny, 
they  can  really  add  up.    One  recent  digital  good  that  Zynga 
whipped  up—digital  sweet  potato  seeds  that  cost  $5  a 
packet—pulled  in  over  $400,000  in  its  first  three  days  [2].  
While  selling  in-app  digital  goods  may  seem  strange,  it  has 
the ability to retain users and increase revenues.  

 

 
Fig. 5   FarmVille’s in-game currency (for buying digital goods) is available 
for purchase with real money 
 

 

Another  way  to  make  money  is  from  ads  within  apps.  
AdMob,  for  instance,  is  a  service  by  Google  that  allows 
developers to monetize their  app by integrating ads into their 
app  [6].    It  works  so  that  once  the  ads  are  in  place,  the 
developer gets paid every time users clicks on ads in their app 
[6].  Whether it be intentional or just an accident, it’s easy for 
an  app  user  to  make  the  occasional  tap  on  an  advertisement.  
Since revenue from ads depends on the app’s traffic, some of 
the  more  popular  apps  have  made  hundreds  of  thousands  in 
AdMob revenue [9].  

V.     APP PUBLICITY 

Sure, a developer can have an awesome app, but in the end 
it’s  almost  worthless  if  people  can’t  find  it.    “The  sheer 
number of apps in the [Apple] App Store  make it difficult  to 
gain much visibility,” says developer Chuck Soper of the Vela 
Design  Group  [5].    Gaining  app  publicity  is  arguably  one  of 
the most important steps for success in the flooded app market.  
App developer Dan Burcaw, couldn’t agree more; he explains 
that  the  “real  battle  is  getting  eyeballs  on  the  product”  [5].  
Luckily, there are ways to do this. 

Having a  website that  not only shows off the functionality 
of the app but provides a direct link to the Apple App Store is 
a  necessity.    A  developer  can’t  just  rely  on  customers  to 
simply  stumble  upon  their  app  as  they  navigate,  unguided 
through the store [5].  Customers need ways of arriving to the 
product such as a direct link from the app’s website.  With the 
Apple  App  Store’s  limited  search  options,  it  can  be  hard  for 
customers  to  find  what  they’re  looking  for  through  the  store, 
but with efficient internet search engines like Google, finding 

a  website  can  be  easier. 
accessibility, app awareness can be improved.    

  With  websites 

increasing 

Viral  advertising  is  also  a  great  way  to  promote  an  app.  
Aside from getting paid for hosting ads, AdMob also provides 
a service where developers can display an ad of their own on 
other  people’s  apps  [6].    This  is  known  as  the  AdMob 
Download  Exchange,  where  developers  can  trade  app  traffic 
in order to promote each other’s apps [9]. 

 

 
Fig. 6    The AdMob Download Exchange cycle [9]. 
 

 

Finding the right places to advertise can be tricky, but with 
the AdMob exchange service, developers can ensure their app 
is  being  spread  virally,  all  over  the  app  marketplace.      Such 
advertising can draw lots of new users since clicks on the ads 
can turn into app downloads [6].  Although a developer pays 
some amount of cents every time a user clicks on their ad, the 
miniscule  fee  is  worth  the  publicity,  and  will  generate  more 
downloads. 

VI. CONCLUSIONS 

The  Apple  App  Store  is  a  crowded  marketplace  where 
unique  innovation  can  be  rewarded  if  it  is  recognized.  
Although  tempting,  developers  shouldn’t  feel  obligated  to 
make  volume apps like those on the “Top” lists because they 
only represent a segment of apps in demand.  Most of the apps 
on  the  “Top”  lists  are  games,  which  tend  to  have  high 
 

investment requirements, making this area a difficult place to 
compete in [4].  While subtle, there are other areas of the app 
market  where  demand  is  increasing.    These  consist  of  app’s 
that  are  considered  “useful”  or  aid  productivity.    That  being 
said,  developers  should  design  apps  that  cater  to  this  area  of 
the  market  because  competition  is  low  and  downloads  are 
abundant.  Furthermore,  to  ensure  a  unique  approach  (and  set 
apart  from  the  amateurs),  developers  should  make  use  of 
iPhone’s  physical  and  programmatic  features.    Incorporating 
iPhone  tech  with  the  use  of  apps  has  made  for  some  of  the 
most  popular  and  successful  apps  on  the  market.  It’s  also 
important  to  understand  the  customer’s  needs,  not  only  to 
determine  an  appropriate  app  price  but  to  make  sure  in-app 
digital  goods  are  purchased.    Lastly,  regardless  of  how  great 
an  app  is,  people  need  to  know  it  exists;  therefore  an  app 
should  have  a  supporting  website  and  be  virally  promoted  in 
order to improve accessibility and increase downloads.
