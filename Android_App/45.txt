INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Previous research has shown that only 17 % of Android
smartphone users are consciously aware of the speciﬁc per-
missions an app demands during installation [2]. While
this result is hardly surprising, it still puts the majority of
smartphone users at risk.

Kelley et al. recently argued that since permissions are
not shown until after the installation button has already
been pressed, the risks potentially arising from excessive app
privileges are not part of the user’s decision process anymore
[3]. They introduced a modiﬁed app information screen and
showed that users became more reluctant to install apps
requesting too many permissions. While they were able to
increase the awareness of requested permissions, participants
still reported that they were unsure about the threats arising
from apps requesting too many permissions.

We can conclude that users currently show limited aware-
ness of threats and risks during the selection and installation
of a new app and that the safety of their personal data is
at stake. We believe that this situation can be improved by
emphasizing the risks associated with an app’s installation.
Thus, we evaluated a novel presentation of app permissions:
our prototype illustrates risks arising from app permissions
in the form of worst-case examples to demonstrate potential
attack scenarios resulting from the malicious use of the re-
quested permissions. In related work, Rader et al. [4] showed
that many users learn about security from informal stories
told by family and friends. Hence, in the terms of their work,
we try to let the app market tell the user small stories about
how private information may be at risk.

In this position paper, we suggest to assist users in un-
derstanding permissions by using examples to communicate
risk. We present results from a pilot study that evaluate the
eﬀectiveness of this approach. We compare app installation
counts of the original Android market with our improved
display.1 Our results show that making threats graspable

2. METHOD

The Android OS deﬁnes a large number of permissions of
which many are rarely used [1]. To test the eﬃcacy of our
alternative permissions display, we selected eight permissions
commonly used by popular apps, since the market generally
displays only a limited number of permissions. To ﬁnd the
most common permissions, we crawled 34,875 most popular
apps on the Android Play Store in early 2013. From this
set, we picked eight common permissions (see Table 1) that
lend themselves well to visualization. An analysis of which
permissions cannot be visualized by examples is subject of
future work, as this exploration intends to show the best-case
eﬀects of our approach.

Based on our ﬁndings, we implemented a mockup of the
Market application (now Play Store2). In addition to the
conventional representation of permissions as text, a more
vivid representation of the aforementioned permissions was
implemented (cf. Figure 1). Before being able to install an
app, the user would be presented with examples of worst-
case scenarios using the capabilities the app will have after
installation. For example, for an app requesting the “take
pictures and videos” permission, the market would show
a live capture of the phone’s camera, the phone’s current
position on a map for the “precise location” permission, and
a slide show of personal pictures stored on the SD card with
a superimposed trash can for the “modify external storage”
permission.

more participants from our subject pool indicated to use
Android 2.3.

Android 2.3.

diﬀerences in our data based on demographics or task order.
The number of apps installed per user was statistically
signiﬁcant between the two versions of the Android market
(paired-samples t-test, t = 3.99, p = .003). In the unmodiﬁed
mockup of the market app, participants installed 2.9 apps on
average while they only installed 1.7 after seeing examples of
threats in our improved version. Moreover, the installation of
apps requiring unnecessary permissions decreased signiﬁcantly
from 50 % to 13.6 % of possible app installs in the over-
requesting ﬁnance and weather categories (t = 3.07, p = .012).
The participants’ reactions to our approach were very
encouraging: Displaying examples made participants see the
possible threats. One participant stated: “Oh, I just found
out that some apps can actually read my data, which I didn’t
realize before.” Another participant also pointed out after
seeing our improved permissions display in contrast to the
original market that realizing the threat will inﬂuence his
behavior: “Right now i realize the impact of the permissions
[. . .] I don’t want to install this app.”

Finally 36.4 % of participants indicated that they worry
about their security during app installation before they tested
our permissions display, while, in the last part of the study,
65.3 % mentioned that they will be more mindful of their
security and privacy in the future.

4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this position paper, we argue that demonstrating po-
tential IT security or privacy risks using concrete examples
is a more eﬀective way of warning users compared to the
traditional approach. We presented a pilot study that tested
the eﬃcacy of visualizing Android app permissions using, for
example, actual private photos, the current location and text
messages sent in near past. We found encouraging results
suggesting that using our system made users more aware of
possible risks arising due to the installation of smartphone
apps.

In future work, we intend to extend our study to conﬁrm
our results for a broader audience. We would also like to
examine which Android permissions and general use cases
can or cannot beneﬁt from this approach. We also intend
to extend this concept beyond permissions. For example,
internet browsers could display form data that a user is going
to send over an insecure channel to warn about not using
SSL. Additionally, the eﬃcacy of a retrospective use of the
example approach may be of interest: After reading emails
over an unencrypted connection, the user could be warned
that this content may have been read by several other parties.

Figure 1: Some examples of visualizations of An-
droid permissions.

Our mockup contained four diﬀerent app categories with
four apps per category, requesting the following permissions:
Oﬃce apps required a reasonable set of permissions (network,
phone status and identity, modify external storage), Finance
apps a slightly unreasonable set (seven permissions including
take pictures and video as well as precise location), Weather
apps an obviously unreasonable set (ﬁve permissions including
modify external storage and taking pictures) and Games
apps required no permissions at all. All apps in one category
requested the same subset of permissions. We chose to vary
permissions between categories instead of between apps to
remove the inﬂuence of non-security or -privacy factors (such
as ratings, comments or pretty screenshots) on the installation
decision.

Our study used limited deception to prevent bias: partici-
pants were invited to a usability test of an alternative app
store implementation. First, participants were presented with
a questionnaire including questions on their general behavior
during app installation and corresponding worries about se-
curity. The questionnaire also contained dummy questions to
distract from the study’s true aim. After obtaining consent,
we installed our mockup store on each participant’s personal
device and then asked them to role play as if they wanted to
install one app from each of the above categories. They were
asked to think-aloud while completing the task and told that
not installing an app is also a valid option. During the en-
tire introduction, we never explicitly mentioned permissions.
After ﬁnishing the tasks, participants completed another
questionnaire, were debriefed and had the opportunity to ask
any questions. The study used a within-subjects design on
the original and modiﬁed versions of the permissions display.
We counterbalanced for eﬀects of learning and fatigue by
randomizing which version of the permissions display was
presented ﬁrst.

We recruited a convenience sample of 11 participants,
including 2 women and 7 participants with a background
