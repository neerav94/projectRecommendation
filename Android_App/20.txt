Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments.

organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman,

specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process.

content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of

I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and

Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and

that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market

assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their

was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals.

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI.

course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated

own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences.

best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

The course met the goal for me to learn about the business of mobile app development. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to program a mobile app. 
It was important to me to have the option of working with the Android or iOS platforms. 
It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The

introduction of AppInventor did help augment the programming capabilities of business students, 
but the class as a whole was divided in terms of their learning goals in this regard (QID 14). 
 
The pitch day (described in Section V.A) at the University provided a synergistic avenue for our 
students to “pitch” their apps and gain impartial feedback from both internal and external judges. 
Evaluation criteria were provided to all judges. The three selected evaluation criteria that 
specifically evaluated entrepreneurship-related learning outcomes are listed in Table 2 and were 
based on the concepts outlined by Stevenson.9

How mature is the concept? Is the key functionality complete; has it been demonstrated? 
Is the product tested and usable? 
Are market assumptions reasonable and correct? How do you rate competitive analysis, 
feasibility, market strategy, and appeal of the product? 
Does this idea/execution have potential? Would you invest? Is there anything that stood 
out?

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

Question ID 31 

The course met the goal for me to learn about the business of mobile app development. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to program a mobile app. 
It was important to me to have the option of working with the Android or iOS platforms. 
It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The  

 

Figure 1: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2012 

 
introduction of AppInventor did help augment the programming capabilities of business students, 
but the class as a whole was divided in terms of their learning goals in this regard (QID 14). 
 
The pitch day (described in Section V.A) at the University provided a synergistic avenue for our 
students to “pitch” their apps and gain impartial feedback from both internal and external judges. 
Evaluation criteria were provided to all judges. The three selected evaluation criteria that 
specifically evaluated entrepreneurship-related learning outcomes are listed in Table 2 and were 
based on the concepts outlined by Stevenson.9

How mature is the concept? Is the key functionality complete; has it been demonstrated? 
Is the product tested and usable? 
Are market assumptions reasonable and correct? How do you rate competitive analysis, 
feasibility, market strategy, and appeal of the product? 
Does this idea/execution have potential? Would you invest? Is there anything that stood 
out? 

 
Figure  2  shows  the  minimum,  maximum,  and  average  scores  awarded  to  each  group  by  the 
judges on a 10-point scale (10 being the highest) to the pitched apps according to the criteria 
listed above. G1 through G5 on the x-axis refer to student groups.

The  graphs  in  the  figure  indicate  that  most  groups  achieved  better  than  average  scores  on  all 
three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G4), it is apparent that while 
the technical prototypes are rather well received, the average scores on business plans and value 
evaluations are just above average and need improvement. Therefore, the students seem to have 
focused most of their attention on getting the app functional, but did not spend as much effort on 
the business aspects of their work. 
 
  
VI.  Third Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
One evolution has been the addition of a two-week, three-way mini-project in the third offering 
that sets up three-member student teams and introduces all students on a team to all platforms 
through demonstrations and discussions of their experiences implementing the same mini-project 
three ways (one student per platform). It runs concurrently with the early part of the course when 
students  are  in  the  process  of  selecting  their  semester-long  project  and  development  platform. 
We plan to expand this mini-project to a three-week project in the fourth offering of the course. 
Furthermore, on account of the weak business focus as evidenced in the pitch day evaluations of 
group  projects,  the  instructors  stressed  the  importance  of  this  aspect  and  made  additional 
business  and  marketing  material  available  to  students.  Each  student  group  was  afforded  an 
opportunity  to  rehearse  its  pitch  in  front  of  its  peer  groups  and  faculty,  and  was  provided 
constructive feedback. 
 
Since  each  student  group  could  work  on  a  different  project  of  its  own  choosing,  some  teams 
realized  that  they  needed  to  learn  additional  subject  matter  that  was  not  taught  in  class.  For 
instance, the use of a gyroscope in conjunction with an accelerometer for detection of linear and 
angular motion requires the fusion of data from these sensors, a considerably complex topic. It 
requires an understanding of how these sensors work, their limitations and the physics involved. 
Such a topic is well outside the scope of the class; however, in such instances, the instructors 
created notes and examples and posted them online for self-study for interested students. Over 
time, and over multiple offerings of the course, the knowledge base grew more comprehensive. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
As in year two, we collected data from a course specific survey in year three. The summary of 
results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 3.

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

Question ID 31 

The course met the goal for me to learn about the business of mobile app development. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to program a mobile app. 
It was important to me to have the option of working with the Android or iOS platforms. 
It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The  

 

Figure 1: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2012 

 
introduction of AppInventor did help augment the programming capabilities of business students, 
but the class as a whole was divided in terms of their learning goals in this regard (QID 14). 
 
The pitch day (described in Section V.A) at the University provided a synergistic avenue for our 
students to “pitch” their apps and gain impartial feedback from both internal and external judges. 
Evaluation criteria were provided to all judges. The three selected evaluation criteria that 
specifically evaluated entrepreneurship-related learning outcomes are listed in Table 2 and were 
based on the concepts outlined by Stevenson.9

How mature is the concept? Is the key functionality complete; has it been demonstrated? 
Is the product tested and usable? 
Are market assumptions reasonable and correct? How do you rate competitive analysis, 
feasibility, market strategy, and appeal of the product? 
Does this idea/execution have potential? Would you invest? Is there anything that stood 
out? 

 
Figure  2  shows  the  minimum,  maximum,  and  average  scores  awarded  to  each  group  by  the 
judges on a 10-point scale (10 being the highest) to the pitched apps according to the criteria 
listed above. G1 through G5 on the x-axis refer to student groups. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2012 

 
The  graphs  in  the  figure  indicate  that  most  groups  achieved  better  than  average  scores  on  all 
three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G4), it is apparent that while 
the technical prototypes are rather well received, the average scores on business plans and value 
evaluations are just above average and need improvement. Therefore, the students seem to have 
focused most of their attention on getting the app functional, but did not spend as much effort on 
the business aspects of their work. 
 
  
VI.  Third Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
One evolution has been the addition of a two-week, three-way mini-project in the third offering 
that sets up three-member student teams and introduces all students on a team to all platforms 
through demonstrations and discussions of their experiences implementing the same mini-project 
three ways (one student per platform). It runs concurrently with the early part of the course when 
students  are  in  the  process  of  selecting  their  semester-long  project  and  development  platform. 
We plan to expand this mini-project to a three-week project in the fourth offering of the course. 
Furthermore, on account of the weak business focus as evidenced in the pitch day evaluations of 
group  projects,  the  instructors  stressed  the  importance  of  this  aspect  and  made  additional 
business  and  marketing  material  available  to  students.  Each  student  group  was  afforded  an 
opportunity  to  rehearse  its  pitch  in  front  of  its  peer  groups  and  faculty,  and  was  provided 
constructive feedback. 
 
Since  each  student  group  could  work  on  a  different  project  of  its  own  choosing,  some  teams 
realized  that  they  needed  to  learn  additional  subject  matter  that  was  not  taught  in  class.  For 
instance, the use of a gyroscope in conjunction with an accelerometer for detection of linear and 
angular motion requires the fusion of data from these sensors, a considerably complex topic. It 
requires an understanding of how these sensors work, their limitations and the physics involved. 
Such a topic is well outside the scope of the class; however, in such instances, the instructors 
created notes and examples and posted them online for self-study for interested students. Over 
time, and over multiple offerings of the course, the knowledge base grew more comprehensive. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
As in year two, we collected data from a course specific survey in year three. The summary of 
results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2013 

 
 
Here we see an even stronger evidence of students recognizing the value of a team-based and 
multi-disciplinary approach to learning (QID 31) and entrepreneurship (QID 19). Again, we see 
that the class opinion is divided on the development of their mobile programming skills (QID 
14). Our analysis of the responses to QID 14 is that when answering this question, students are 
assessing their own individual capability and not necessarily the capability of the team as a 
whole. We intend to rephrase this question in the future to clarify the matter. 
 
The  entrepreneurship-related  learning  outcomes  were  assessed  again  in  2013  on  pitch  day. 
Judges used a 5-point scale (5 being the highest) to evaluate each student group as per the three 
criteria  identified  in  Table  2.  Figure  4  shows  the  resulting  minimum,  maximum,  and  average 
scores awarded to each of the groups G1 – G5. The scores have been converted to a 10-point 
scale for uniformity with Figure 2. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2013 

 
The graphs in the figure indicate that, again, most groups achieved better than average scores on 
all three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G1), it is apparent that

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
• 
Intellectual Property: rights, agreements, and responsibilities  
•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

Question ID 31 

The course met the goal for me to learn about the business of mobile app development. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to program a mobile app. 
It was important to me to have the option of working with the Android or iOS platforms. 
It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The  

 

Figure 1: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2012 

 
introduction of AppInventor did help augment the programming capabilities of business students, 
but the class as a whole was divided in terms of their learning goals in this regard (QID 14). 
 
The pitch day (described in Section V.A) at the University provided a synergistic avenue for our 
students to “pitch” their apps and gain impartial feedback from both internal and external judges. 
Evaluation criteria were provided to all judges. The three selected evaluation criteria that 
specifically evaluated entrepreneurship-related learning outcomes are listed in Table 2 and were 
based on the concepts outlined by Stevenson.9

How mature is the concept? Is the key functionality complete; has it been demonstrated? 
Is the product tested and usable? 
Are market assumptions reasonable and correct? How do you rate competitive analysis, 
feasibility, market strategy, and appeal of the product? 
Does this idea/execution have potential? Would you invest? Is there anything that stood 
out? 

 
Figure  2  shows  the  minimum,  maximum,  and  average  scores  awarded  to  each  group  by  the 
judges on a 10-point scale (10 being the highest) to the pitched apps according to the criteria 
listed above. G1 through G5 on the x-axis refer to student groups. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2012 

 
The  graphs  in  the  figure  indicate  that  most  groups  achieved  better  than  average  scores  on  all 
three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G4), it is apparent that while 
the technical prototypes are rather well received, the average scores on business plans and value 
evaluations are just above average and need improvement. Therefore, the students seem to have 
focused most of their attention on getting the app functional, but did not spend as much effort on 
the business aspects of their work. 
 
  
VI.  Third Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
One evolution has been the addition of a two-week, three-way mini-project in the third offering 
that sets up three-member student teams and introduces all students on a team to all platforms 
through demonstrations and discussions of their experiences implementing the same mini-project 
three ways (one student per platform). It runs concurrently with the early part of the course when 
students  are  in  the  process  of  selecting  their  semester-long  project  and  development  platform. 
We plan to expand this mini-project to a three-week project in the fourth offering of the course. 
Furthermore, on account of the weak business focus as evidenced in the pitch day evaluations of 
group  projects,  the  instructors  stressed  the  importance  of  this  aspect  and  made  additional 
business  and  marketing  material  available  to  students.  Each  student  group  was  afforded  an 
opportunity  to  rehearse  its  pitch  in  front  of  its  peer  groups  and  faculty,  and  was  provided 
constructive feedback. 
 
Since  each  student  group  could  work  on  a  different  project  of  its  own  choosing,  some  teams 
realized  that  they  needed  to  learn  additional  subject  matter  that  was  not  taught  in  class.  For 
instance, the use of a gyroscope in conjunction with an accelerometer for detection of linear and 
angular motion requires the fusion of data from these sensors, a considerably complex topic. It 
requires an understanding of how these sensors work, their limitations and the physics involved. 
Such a topic is well outside the scope of the class; however, in such instances, the instructors 
created notes and examples and posted them online for self-study for interested students. Over 
time, and over multiple offerings of the course, the knowledge base grew more comprehensive. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
As in year two, we collected data from a course specific survey in year three. The summary of 
results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2013 

 
 
Here we see an even stronger evidence of students recognizing the value of a team-based and 
multi-disciplinary approach to learning (QID 31) and entrepreneurship (QID 19). Again, we see 
that the class opinion is divided on the development of their mobile programming skills (QID 
14). Our analysis of the responses to QID 14 is that when answering this question, students are 
assessing their own individual capability and not necessarily the capability of the team as a 
whole. We intend to rephrase this question in the future to clarify the matter. 
 
The  entrepreneurship-related  learning  outcomes  were  assessed  again  in  2013  on  pitch  day. 
Judges used a 5-point scale (5 being the highest) to evaluate each student group as per the three 
criteria  identified  in  Table  2.  Figure  4  shows  the  resulting  minimum,  maximum,  and  average 
scores awarded to each of the groups G1 – G5. The scores have been converted to a 10-point 
scale for uniformity with Figure 2. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2013 

 
The graphs in the figure indicate that, again, most groups achieved better than average scores on 
all three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G1), it is apparent that 

while the technical prototypes were still well received, the average scores for business plans and 
business value evaluations show a definite improvement from the prior year.

VII. Conclusion 
 
The Mobile App Development course was developed in order to encourage cross-disciplinary, 
collaborative learning among students with diverse academic skills using a strong entrepreneurial 
framework. Students and faculty from three different colleges interact closely and synergistically 
in a project-driven course. The expectation is that through interaction with one another, students 
will be better able to appreciate the finer points of each others’ disciplines. While the journey so 
far has been challenging, continuous refinements to the course have made the goals quite 
attainable. 
 
Our partnership among three colleges/majors is one of the course’s main distinguishing features. 
Another  distinguishing  feature  is  the  platform-agnosticism,  with  iOS,  Android  and  HTML5 
being supported in equal measures; most courses in other Universities that we know of adopt one 
or the other. This is also the source of our biggest pedagogical challenge as we strive to keep 
students from different platforms engaged when their platform is not being discussed. 
 
Formal assessment by means of student surveys in Figures 1 and 3 indicate that students value 
both the academic contributions and the entrepreneurial aspects of the course. Figure 5 
demonstrates that the third offering of the course (in 2013) met its objectives better than the 
second offering (in 2012). Further, entrepreneurship-related outcomes were assessed using three 
specific evaluation criteria. In particular, using these evaluation criteria, feedback on the quality 
and business-readiness of student apps was provided by internal and external judges on pitch day

Mobile App Development: 

A Cross-Discipline Team-Based Approach to Student and 

Faculty Learning 

 
 
Abstract 
 
Technical courses taught in a university setting focus exclusively on technical elegance. 
Although such a narrow, academically rigorous approach is successful in imparting technical 
competence in the subject at hand, students do not get an adequate sense of how the practitioners 
in their profession interact with their counterparts in other professions in the real world. The aim 
of our cross-disciplinary “Mobile App Development” course is to remedy this missed opportunity 
by providing an opportunity for students and faculty members from three different disciplines 
(engineering, computer science, and business) to experience and learn the nuances of each others' 
fields, while simultaneously introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. Such an unorthodox 
mix of students sharing a single classroom calls for non-traditional teaching strategies and 
evaluation techniques. This paper discusses those techniques, the challenges involved in meeting 
the stated outcomes, and three iterations of refinements in the evolution of the course leading up 
to its current format. An interesting aspect of the course is that each cross-disciplinary student 
team is expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product by the end of the 
course that is jointly assessed by the course professors and external judges from industry. Lastly, 
although this course requires significant teaching effort, the instructors, the participating students 
and our University is convinced that the benefits of such collaborative learning are worthy of 
further investments. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
As early as 1916, J. Dewey propounded the complementary ideas of experiential learning and 
interdisciplinary learning.1 H. Taba, a student of Dewey's, expanded the field of progressive 
learning by introducing inductive and creative learning techniques.2 Students were encouraged to 
organize related concepts from two or more diverse fields of learning, into groups. Ackerman, 
Perkins and Jacobs3 put forth very strong arguments in favor of a combination of discipline-
specific as well as complementary inter-disciplinary learning. Furthermore, they emphasized the 
importance of interweaving skills and knowledge-based content in the learning process. 
 
Today, many university programs try to integrate experiential and inter-disciplinary learning in 
their curricula. For instance, some courses attempt to introduce experiential leaning through 
inter-disciplinary projects.4 Others teach loosely related topics using a unifying theme in fields 
such psychology5 and biology.6 However, most inter-disciplinary courses usually focus on the 
depth of specific content in a couple of disciplines rather than the breadth, i.e. integration of 
content across a variety of disciplines. More specifically, all students taking such an inter-
disciplinary course are required to master the skills and the content equally well regardless of 
their core discipline. An immediate shortcoming of this approach is that it severely restricts the 
diversity of student participants with respect to their prior preparation. Thus, cross-pollination of 
ideas among students of diverse disciplines is not easily achieved. In the real world, it is more 
reasonable to expect that when working in a team, team members are experts in their specific 
fields, but are less familiar in other areas. Consequently, as a practical matter, project leaders 

strive for diversity in a team's aggregate expertise rather than rely on a few superhuman members 
with diverse skill sets. 
 
Even when inter-disciplinary courses are taught in technical programs such as engineering and 
computer science, the focus is usually on attaining a technically elegant solution. The economy 
and timeliness in reaching the said solution are usually ignored. The unfortunate side-effect is 
that many engineers and scientists believe that a great idea sells itself regardless of market 
dynamics. The lack of understanding of how a business functions may lead to adversarial 
relationships between technical employees and their business-oriented colleagues.7, 8 Similarly, 
when business managers interact with their technical employees, they often do not fully 
appreciate the complex nature of the technical development process and the numerous missteps 
on the way to a successful product. 
 
Therefore, in designing and refining a course for students with diverse academic backgrounds, 
we had the thematic goals of helping them: i. learn a variety of interconnected topics through 
experiential means while allowing them to contribute significantly in their area of expertise,  ii.  
interact with other students with very different academic backgrounds in a classroom/laboratory 
setting and,  iii. develop empathy towards, and a greater understanding of each others’ 
professions by making them “walk in each others’ shoes” in a cross-disciplinary team-taught 
course. In addition, student groups are encouraged to propose and select their own semester-long 
course projects that directly complement these thematic goals. Thus, in accordance with Dewey’s 
main ideas1, we not only attempt to emulate a real world cross-disciplinary experiential learning 
environment, but also democratize the project selection process in order to enhance the students’ 
investment in their work. Furthermore, in accordance with the ideas put forth by Ackerman et 
al.3, we interweave class instruction (knowledge-based content) with project work (skills) in 
order to facilitate learning. 
 
This paper describes the initial design and the iterative refinement of our cross-disciplinary 
Mobile App Development course over a period of three years. The rest of the paper is organized 
as follows. Section II outlines the reasons for selecting Mobile App Development as the course’s 
unifying theme. Section III discusses the practical constraints that we placed on our course in 
addition to the thematic goals listed above. Section IV describes the objectives, organization, 
syllabus and pedagogical approach that we designed for the initial course offering in Spring 
2010, as well as the assessment of the course. Section V describes the refinements incorporated 
in the second offering of the course based on the assessment of the first offering, as well as its 
own assessment. Section VI describes the further refined, third offering of the course based on 
assessment of the second offering, and its own assessment. Section VII concludes the paper by 
discussing the salient points of the course and providing some assessment-based inferences. 
 
 
II.  Course Topic Selection 
 
A Mobile App Development course is a good candidate for a cross-disciplinary effort since it 
involves a combination of both technical and nontechnical topics. For instance, in order to 
successfully develop an application (app), one needs to learn at least three or four of the 
following: mobile application programming on one of two different platforms (Android and 

iOS), complementary data structures, user interface design, networking and communication, the 
use of on-board sensors, and security. In order to successfully sell such an app, one needs to be 
entrepreneurial in analyzing the market need and its potential size, then construct a business plan, 
explore avenues for developmental funding and revenues, and design a marketing strategy. In 
addition, one also needs to hone one's soft skills such as presentation of ideas to appeal to a 
group of investors and the complementary one-minute “elevator pitch.” 
 
Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, mobile app products have a low barrier to 
entry in the marketplace. The initial platform investment consists of a smartphone, which most 
students already possess, and a software development kit with a developer's license (free for 
Android, under $100 per year for iOS). Once the app is ready, the vendor running the app-store 
provides free hosting services and payment. This eliminates any up-front cost and time overhead 
incurred by the developer to set up a storefront and a payment processing system. Therefore, 
such a system is ideal for small development teams with a low startup budget. 
 
Clearly, a course using mobile apps as the unifying theme weaves many individual, diverse 
subtopics together and presents a very good opportunity for students to experience the intricacies 
of each other’s disciplines; it allows them to work closely with students of a different mindset 
and gain a better understanding of viewpoints other than their own. Such a course naturally lends 
itself to team-teaching and requires a combination of traditional and unconventional student and 
course evaluation techniques that mirror both the academic as well as the real world. As a 
practical matter, the course is housed in the Department of Computing Sciences, but brings 
together faculty and students from disciplines in three colleges: College of Engineering 
(Electrical and Computer Engineering majors), College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Computer 
Science majors), and Business School (various business majors). The following section describes 
the features that were maintained across all offerings of our Mobile App Development course. 
 
III.  Overarching Course Design Features 
 
An entrepreneurial theme was considered essential to the Mobile App Development course; there 
were guest lectures by entrepreneurs and industry practitioners on topics such as business plans, 
creative thinking, project management techniques, and technical trends in the app industry. 
Students were also challenged to understand that no matter how technically “showy” their app 
ideas are, they must be adapted to market trends and user acceptability testing. In addition, 
students need to realize that this requirement must be met even if they are developing apps for a 
large corporation’s captive in-house audience; managers will not want to invest person-months 
on projects that will not be used because the design did not take the corporate culture into 
account! 
 
We also decided that the course would benefit from a semester-long project that is proposed and 
implemented by multi-disciplinary teams of students. The teams are responsible for justifying 
their interface design, marketing strategy, and implementation based on technical considerations 
as well as on business and entrepreneurial research. By the end of the course, students are 
expected to deliver a “close-to-market” mobile application product along with a business plan for 
the monetization of their product. In the project, each participant observes and experiences the 
nuances of the others’ fields: in developing their product, business students sometimes program, 

but always exert influence on the app design from a usability and marketability perspective, 
while engineering and computer science students help develop business and marketing plans 
with advice on what is technically feasible. Computer engineering and computer science students 
learn about the harsh realities of business decisions, and business majors learn the technological 
challenges, limitations, and thought processes that go into designing a technical product. 
 
It was further decided to make the course approximate a platform-neutral environment by 
initially supporting both iOS and Android. Later, HTML5 support was added. This decision was 
made based on several observations. First, we foresaw that the overhead of trying to purchase 
enough of each year’s latest smartphone and tablet models for a class of thirty students would 
overwhelm our financial resources. Therefore, it was decided that students would use their own 
devices for development, which again would lead to biases in their platform choices unless we 
took a concerted platform-neutral approach. The course attracted enough attention for Verizon 
Wireless to contribute five free mobile phones with unlimited data plans for those students that 
did not own smartphones. Second, given the multi-platform nature of the mobile app field, we 
felt that it was important for students to experience one long-term project with one platform. In 
addition, some familiarity with other platforms was also needed so as to objectively evaluate 
platform suitability for future projects. Third, students from each college come with different 
programming backgrounds: some have primary programming experience in C++, while others 
are proficient in Java, Visual Basic, or Javascript. 
 
The instructors are rotated year to year within each contributing department to allow the 
department chairs some flexibility in their teaching schedules.  Each instructor is experienced in  
at least one of the development platforms. The maximum enrollment is thirty students with the 
constraint that no more than ten students may be drawn from any one discipline during initial 
registration. After the initial three-week registration period, this constraint is lifted. This practice 
ensures that students from all three disciplines get a fair share of the available seats. It also 
supports the creation of diverse development teams with one student from each college per team. 
 
In order to support the course goal of fostering entrepreneurial thinking, instructors discussed the 
nature of entrepreneurship with students using definitions such as “working to meet people’s 
needs before people realize they have the need,” and Stevenson’s classic, “the pursuit of 
opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” 9 After discussing several case 
studies, students were then invited to identify opportunities within the mobile app arena: what 
needs do they think that they, their peers, or their families have, that could be addressed with 
apps; how could existing apps be improved to better meet consumers’ needs? In the first two 
course offerings, students discussed their ideas and formed their own teams within the group 
membership policy presented earlier in this section. In the third and fourth course offerings, we 
formalized the team creation process by encouraging students to post their reflections on an 
“Idea Bounce” blog; the students then “pitched” their app ideas in class, and listed their three 
best ideas in order of preference. The instructors then matched students to create teams based on 
these preference lists. 
 
In addition, instructors provided general advice about categories of resources a team might need 
for its project. However, in keeping with the Stevenson’s entrepreneurship definition, each team 
was expected to identify and seek out the specific resources they would need for building their 

app (e.g., programming skills, developer licenses and tools, artwork, database servers, etc.). In 
recent course offerings, student teams are also required to make engaging formal pitches (e.g., 
video promotions, acting, video editing, elevator pitches, and app demonstrations) at the Student 
Entrepreneurship Competition (SEC) for a panel of business leaders, venture capitalists, and 
entrepreneurs drawn from across the country. 
 
 
IV.  First Course Offering 
 
This section describes the design of our course and highlights its entrepreneurship-focused 
project-centric, cross-disciplinary learning approach. The course description here will also be the 
basis for describing what changes were made in later offerings and why they were made. 
Therefore, sections V and VI will only highlight the modifications from the first course offering. 
 
A. Course Design 
 
The Spring 2011 Mobile App Development course was announced with the following goals:  

foster entrepreneurial thinking 

• 
•  create an awareness that a real-life approach to product development spans multiple 

disciplines, and 

•  demonstrate the value of collaborating with peers across disciplines to champion one’s 

vision; success is not guaranteed, but it is not incidental either 
 

There were two weekly 75-minute class sessions. In each week, one session was dedicated to 
classroom instruction, and the majority of the other session was dedicated to student team 
development, with faculty available for consultation on the teams’ programming questions. 
Instructors took turns teaching discipline-specific topics in modular styles. All instructors 
attended every class along with the students and participated in class discussions, regardless of 
which instructor was scheduled to present a lecture. The intent was to convey the message to the 
students that topics outside their fields are just as important as those within their fields for 
success in the course. There were three guest lectures from entrepreneurs in the local 
Philadelphia mobile app startup community. Students were expected to write summaries of these 
presentations and critique them for style and content in the following class session. 
 
The main topics for lecture presentations and their presentation order were: 

•  Programming apps in Android or iOS platforms and platform emulators 
•  Comparison of the iOS and the Android ecosystems 
•  Design and implementation of a clean and coherent user interface (UI). 
•  Market analysis and entrepreneurial opportunities  
•  Business plans, product marketing and monetization 
•  Device communication using Bluetooth and TCP/IP protocols 
•  Accessing and using data from smartphone sensors 
•

•  Comparison of Web apps and HTML5 apps with native apps 
•  Effective techniques in pitching products to potential investors, and full rehearsals. 

In addition, supplemental lectures on security were added later upon student request. No required 
course text was specified. 
   
The second session each week was designated for work on team projects. In the initial few weeks 
of the semester, the emphasis in these sessions was on organizing the app ideas and creating 
rough implementations of the app interfaces using standard layout schemes as much as possible 
in Android and iOS. Later, teams used this time period for writing “Project Milestone” 
assignment reports, developing business plans, and integrating code from extracurricular team 
meetings and code libraries available on the internet.   
 
A core component of the course was a semester-long group project that included a complete life-
cycle of app development from idea, to business plan, to coding and market feasibility. Central to 
the project was the cross-disciplinary, experiential learning component; therefore, the execution 
of the team project required the students to perform the following steps in a timely fashion. 
Students were required to form teams comprised of three members, each from a different major. 
They then selected either the Android or the iOS platform for their projects, and proposed an app 
idea along with a set of features for implementation. The proposals were evaluated by the 
instructors for technical and economic feasibility. Based on the feedback they received, they 
either revised the scope and focus of the project, or proposed an alternative one. 
 
Students were graded as follows: 30% Project, 20% Final, 20% Midterm, 20% Project Milestone 
Assignments, and 10% Class Participation.  Thus, 50% of their grade depended on the project. 
Students were advised regarding their app projects in that their app grade would depend on how 
complete their apps were based on their second-draft proposals; if promised features were 
missing, significantly lower grades would be awarded.  Students were allowed to form their own 
teams. They were discouraged from choosing games as their app idea since games apps tend to 
require extensive graphics skills and design time; the instructors felt that one semester was too 
short a time-frame for students with heterogeneous programming experience levels to complete a 
plausibly compelling game app.  
 
Examinations were designed to be uniform for the course population, which meant that students 
were responsible for understanding material from outside their major. The examination questions 
were vetted by all three instructors to ensure they were not over-dependent on any narrow 
discipline-specific material covered outside of the Mobile App Development course. 
 
Once the project selections were finalized, the students undertook a broader market study to 
determine the implementation features in their app deemed to be absolutely essential. Other 
features were prioritized based on the competitive advantage that they would provide the app vis-
a-vis other market competitors. Next, students designed the screen art, the user interface (UI) 
screens, and created mock-ups using free-hand sketches or computer-based tools. The instructors 
then evaluated the UI designs for aesthetics as well as usability i.e., color visibility of and 
contrast between UI elements, placement of buttons, the readability of labels, coherence of 
themes, logical grouping of app controls, etc. Student teams were expected to take this feedback 
into account in refining their UI. 
 

The development of a business plan proceeded in parallel with the app development activity. The 
student teams had to identify and study the potential market for their app, determine market 
positioning of the app, perform a strength-weakness-opportunities-threat (SWOT) analysis, 
identify and project revenue streams, costs, required financing, and the breakeven point. Thus, 
the intricate interweaving of business and technical topics during the execution of the project 
provided an opportunity for very close interaction among all team members. 
 
At the end of the semester, all team members had to provide a demonstration of their working 
app along with the business plan to the entire class, faculty, and selected external reviewers. 
Each project was evaluated by faculty and external reviewers on metrics such as the degree of 
completion, aesthetic appeal of the UI, the workability of the business plan, and the quality and 
appeal of the presentation to potential investors. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
We used a variety of formal and informal assessment techniques in order to examine whether our 
course  goals  are  being  met.  We  then  used  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refine  the  course 
content and focus on subsequent offerings. 
 
For year one, we relied on the University-administered generic year-end Course and Teacher 
Survey (CATS) for instruction related data about the course. However, these questions did not 
address  any  course-specific  goals.  For  subsequent  offerings  we  created  a  separate  anonymous 
course-specific survey for students. A sample of these questions is given in Table 1, Section V.B. 
In addition, in year two and three, internal and external judges assessed entrepreneurship-related 
outcomes using a separate set of criteria (see Table 2, Section V.B).  
 
Although  course  specific  survey  data  was  not  available  in  year  one,  we  did  use  the  written 
comments  on  the  CATS  to  assess  the  problem  areas  and  revise  the  second  offering.  In  these 
comments, the students felt strongly that their programming capabilities in any given platform 
varied tremendously. 
 
 
V.  Second Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
In order to reduce the disparity associated with programming skills, we decided to include 
mandatory programming exercises for all students based on AppInventor, which is an Android-
based, easy to use, automated platform for building mobile applications (an equivalent aid was 
unavailable for iOS). The objective was to provide some practice to all students to implement a 
small app in preparation for their course project. Later, however, students were free to choose 
(and they did choose) any platform for their course project.  
 
The introduction of AppInventor allowed us to increase the frequency of deliverables, enforce 
stricter  milestones  and  identify  unmotivated  students.  However  it  required  a  disproportionate 
amount of instructional resources for platform maintenance, and diverted attention from the key 

focus of the course. We found that students still chose platforms emotionally, not rationally; their 
comments  indicated  that  they  still  saw  themselves  in  traditional  roles  in  alignment  with  their 
majors.  However,  the  silos  did  break  down  somewhat  and  AppInventor  did  help  business 
students (only business students agreed with the question “it was useful to explore the mobile 
platform via AppInventor projects” on the course survey). Planning averted lost class sessions 
due to last-minute guest speaker cancellations as we had prepared extra material for presentation. 
 
In order to provide the students a real world experience, we linked project presentations with a 
University-wide entrepreneurial competition called the pitch day. Student teams (groups) were 
required to “pitch” their ideas and working demonstrations to external judges from a pool of 
entrepreneurs, business leaders, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists. All student 
groups had working demonstrations for the pitch day, which exceeded even our expectations. 
Critiques and comments collected from external judges indicated that they were rather impressed 
with the groups’ achievements.  
 
B. Assessment 
 
In year two, in addition to CATS surveys, we created a separate anonymous survey containing 
questions specific to course goals and design. A sample of these questions is shown in Table 1. 
For each question, a range of responses from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree were collected 
and  analyzed.  These  questions  were  designed  to  address  course-specific  goals  including  the 
team-based multi-disciplinary approach as well as platform neutrality.

The course met the goal for me to learn about the business of mobile app development. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to program a mobile app. 
It was important to me to have the option of working with the Android or iOS platforms. 
It was valuable to hear what entrepreneurs are doing in the area of mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about how to write a business plan. 
The course met the goal for me to learn how to design user interfaces for mobile apps. 
The course met the goal for me to learn about the strategy and marketing behind mobile app 
development. 
It was valuable to me to work with team members from other colleges. 

 
The summary of results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 1 below. In compiling 
this data, for the purpose of current discussion, we have collapsed Strongly Agree, Agree, etc. 
into one category called Agree. Similarly, Strongly Disagree, Disagree, etc. have been merged 
into just Disagree. 
 
Question IDs (QIDs) 12, 19, 22, and 30 were designed to address the business and 
entrepreneurship aspects of mobile app development. The response to QID 22 indicated that the 
course failed to adequately address the details of writing a business plan. It was imperative to 
correct this shortcoming in year three. Responses to QID 30 identified similar concerns in the 
study of strategy and marketing behind mobile application development. Responses to QID 31 
indicate that we were successful in making the course team-based and multi-disciplinary. The  

 

Figure 1: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2012 

 
introduction of AppInventor did help augment the programming capabilities of business students, 
but the class as a whole was divided in terms of their learning goals in this regard (QID 14). 
 
The pitch day (described in Section V.A) at the University provided a synergistic avenue for our 
students to “pitch” their apps and gain impartial feedback from both internal and external judges. 
Evaluation criteria were provided to all judges. The three selected evaluation criteria that 
specifically evaluated entrepreneurship-related learning outcomes are listed in Table 2 and were 
based on the concepts outlined by Stevenson.9

How mature is the concept? Is the key functionality complete; has it been demonstrated? 
Is the product tested and usable? 
Are market assumptions reasonable and correct? How do you rate competitive analysis, 
feasibility, market strategy, and appeal of the product? 
Does this idea/execution have potential? Would you invest? Is there anything that stood 
out? 

 
Figure  2  shows  the  minimum,  maximum,  and  average  scores  awarded  to  each  group  by  the 
judges on a 10-point scale (10 being the highest) to the pitched apps according to the criteria 
listed above. G1 through G5 on the x-axis refer to student groups. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2012 

 
The  graphs  in  the  figure  indicate  that  most  groups  achieved  better  than  average  scores  on  all 
three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G4), it is apparent that while 
the technical prototypes are rather well received, the average scores on business plans and value 
evaluations are just above average and need improvement. Therefore, the students seem to have 
focused most of their attention on getting the app functional, but did not spend as much effort on 
the business aspects of their work. 
 
  
VI.  Third Course Offering 
 
A. Course Refinements 
 
One evolution has been the addition of a two-week, three-way mini-project in the third offering 
that sets up three-member student teams and introduces all students on a team to all platforms 
through demonstrations and discussions of their experiences implementing the same mini-project 
three ways (one student per platform). It runs concurrently with the early part of the course when 
students  are  in  the  process  of  selecting  their  semester-long  project  and  development  platform. 
We plan to expand this mini-project to a three-week project in the fourth offering of the course. 
Furthermore, on account of the weak business focus as evidenced in the pitch day evaluations of 
group  projects,  the  instructors  stressed  the  importance  of  this  aspect  and  made  additional 
business  and  marketing  material  available  to  students.  Each  student  group  was  afforded  an 
opportunity  to  rehearse  its  pitch  in  front  of  its  peer  groups  and  faculty,  and  was  provided 
constructive feedback. 
 
Since  each  student  group  could  work  on  a  different  project  of  its  own  choosing,  some  teams 
realized  that  they  needed  to  learn  additional  subject  matter  that  was  not  taught  in  class.  For 
instance, the use of a gyroscope in conjunction with an accelerometer for detection of linear and 
angular motion requires the fusion of data from these sensors, a considerably complex topic. It 
requires an understanding of how these sensors work, their limitations and the physics involved. 
Such a topic is well outside the scope of the class; however, in such instances, the instructors 
created notes and examples and posted them online for self-study for interested students. Over 
time, and over multiple offerings of the course, the knowledge base grew more comprehensive. 
 
B. Assessment 
 
As in year two, we collected data from a course specific survey in year three. The summary of 
results for selected questions in Table 1 is given in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3: Course Goals Survey Results Spring 2013 

 
 
Here we see an even stronger evidence of students recognizing the value of a team-based and 
multi-disciplinary approach to learning (QID 31) and entrepreneurship (QID 19). Again, we see 
that the class opinion is divided on the development of their mobile programming skills (QID 
14). Our analysis of the responses to QID 14 is that when answering this question, students are 
assessing their own individual capability and not necessarily the capability of the team as a 
whole. We intend to rephrase this question in the future to clarify the matter. 
 
The  entrepreneurship-related  learning  outcomes  were  assessed  again  in  2013  on  pitch  day. 
Judges used a 5-point scale (5 being the highest) to evaluate each student group as per the three 
criteria  identified  in  Table  2.  Figure  4  shows  the  resulting  minimum,  maximum,  and  average 
scores awarded to each of the groups G1 – G5. The scores have been converted to a 10-point 
scale for uniformity with Figure 2. 
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4: Pitch-Day Evaluation of Entrepreneurship Skills Spring 2013 

 
The graphs in the figure indicate that, again, most groups achieved better than average scores on 
all three evaluation criteria. If we ignore the poorest performing group (G1), it is apparent that 

while the technical prototypes were still well received, the average scores for business plans and 
business value evaluations show a definite improvement from the prior year.

VII. Conclusion 
 
The Mobile App Development course was developed in order to encourage cross-disciplinary, 
collaborative learning among students with diverse academic skills using a strong entrepreneurial 
framework. Students and faculty from three different colleges interact closely and synergistically 
in a project-driven course. The expectation is that through interaction with one another, students 
will be better able to appreciate the finer points of each others’ disciplines. While the journey so 
far has been challenging, continuous refinements to the course have made the goals quite 
attainable. 
 
Our partnership among three colleges/majors is one of the course’s main distinguishing features. 
Another  distinguishing  feature  is  the  platform-agnosticism,  with  iOS,  Android  and  HTML5 
being supported in equal measures; most courses in other Universities that we know of adopt one 
or the other. This is also the source of our biggest pedagogical challenge as we strive to keep 
students from different platforms engaged when their platform is not being discussed. 
 
Formal assessment by means of student surveys in Figures 1 and 3 indicate that students value 
both the academic contributions and the entrepreneurial aspects of the course. Figure 5 
demonstrates that the third offering of the course (in 2013) met its objectives better than the 
second offering (in 2012). Further, entrepreneurship-related outcomes were assessed using three 
specific evaluation criteria. In particular, using these evaluation criteria, feedback on the quality 
and business-readiness of student apps was provided by internal and external judges on pitch day 

at the University-wide entrepreneurial competition. Figures 2 and 4 indicate that the technical 
maturity of the apps was clearly evident according to the judges in both the 2012 and 2013 
offerings of the course. In addition, while the business maturity of the apps was somewhat 
lacking in 2012, targeted efforts during the course refinement process yielded better results in 
this area in 2013. The contribution of the entrepreneurial component was further evident when a 
cross-disciplinary student team from this class won a University-wide award in 2013 (out of 
forty participating teams) in an entrepreneurship competition for an app developed as part of the 
class deliverable. Furthermore, entrepreneurial activities are encouraged and supported by an 
innovation center in the business school even after the course concludes. 
 
An informal measure of a course’s success is its popularity and wide appeal. The Mobile App 
Development course has run successfully for three consecutive years with enrollment at 80% to 
100% of scheduled capacity (30 students) and the fourth offering is now running at full capacity 
as well. Furthermore, the innovations introduced in the course won three of the instructors an 
award in entrepreneurship teaching and pedagogical innovation from the Global Consortium of 
Entrepreneurship Centers, a consortium of more than 200 University centers. 
 
Lastly, we would like to note that although we collected data both formally and informally on 
student  learning,  we  did  not  have  an  explicit  mechanism  in  place  to  collect  data  for  faculty 
learning. Nevertheless, the lessons learned in the planning, design and refinement of this course 
and the complex logistics behind it were invaluable and were widely disseminated to the wider 
faculty within the University. While such a cross-disciplinary, entrepreneurship-focused course 
can prove to be rewarding to students and faculty alike, it does need significant administrative 
and material support from the university in order to make it successful.
