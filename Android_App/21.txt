Abstract: This paper presents the mobile application development process and students’ 
satisfaction of the developed app for the Engineering Economics course. The mobile app was 
first designed in Summer 2012, and the app was incorporated into the Engineering Economics 
course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013). The app is named as ‘Engineering 
Economics Jeopardy!’ because it was designed in an educational game style, which was one of 
desired features by students. The app incorporates all the components including E-book, 
calculator, reference tables, conceptual questions and practical problems, in the previous version 
but present them in a different and livelier fashion. The E-book is a summary of the key concepts 
of Engineering Economics. The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering 
economics problems with formulas. The tables allow the users to compute discrete compound 
interest factors. The main interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete 
with two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and 
practical problems. Different sets of problems range from the simple questions on time values of 
money to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and 
Supply Demand Equilibrium. From the competition interface, users may access the relevant 
topics in the E-book and use the calculator and interest tables to help themselves. The mobile app 
has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and they have been 
released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. This app is intended to give students more 
opportunity to learn and practice concepts of Engineering Economics whenever and where they 
want using their mobile devices. 116 students participated in this study. Surveys and interview 
results showed that the majority of the students who used the app said that the app aided their 
learning. 94% of the users said that they would recommend using the app to others who study 
Engineering Economics.

1.  Introduction 
 
Engineering Economics is a core class in the field of engineering and is also covered on the 

Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step to be a Professional Engineer 
(PE). This course teaches skills required to analyze cash flows, costs, and the time value of 
money through various methods and performance measures. The challenge for educators is that 
engineering economic analysis is primarily concerned with problem solving methods that seem 
to be non-intuitive for many students. Alternative teaching methods including Internet integration 
with other courses1, and a mechanics analysis of the cash flows2, have been proposed in the 
literature. At the authors’ university, the performance for the academic year of 2010 shows that 
almost 14% of the students dropped the course and the number went up to 43%, if combined 
with students who failed or obtained a marginal grade D. Consequently, they were required to 
retake the course according to the university policy. Nationwide, Engineering Economics is a 
required course by many engineering disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to design innovative 
instructional approaches for this course to improve student retention in engineering. Based on 
our needs assessment, the students need: 1) more explanation of abstract concepts with better 
illustrations and practical scenarios; 2) more communication channels for interaction with the 
instructor and amongst classmates; 3) a ubiquitous access to learning materials at their own pace.  

 

Smartphone apps can potentially help today’s students by providing ubiquitous access to 

multimedia learning materials along with more channels for interaction. A smartphone is a 
mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary 
basic feature phone. Smartphones run complete operating system software, providing a platform 
for application developers. Apple iOS and Google Android are two examples of popular 
smartphone platforms. Today, smartphones offer multi-touch screen interfaces featuring many 
small apps with different functions. Some of these small apps are educational applications via 
online market places, such as the Android Play store and the Apple App store. At the time of our 
proposal writing in 2010, no suitable apps were available in the stores. Currently there are a few 
simple apps serving as calculators and interest tables. We have developed an app with a much 
more comprehensive coverage that allows students to learn most of the Engineering Economics 
key concepts. In addition, it has been updated though one year’s formative assessment with 
university students. 

 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces research background 

information. Section 3 explains our published mobile apps, “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”. 
Section 4 discusses the student satisfaction of the current app. Section 5 concludes the paper and 
suggests future work.   

 

 

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey 

these concepts5. The instructor reports that very frequently students confounded time value of 
money with inflation. 

 
Since personal computers became available in homes and schools, development in 

educational technology has progressed at an accelerated pace6. In this paper, we focus on mobile 
apps for multimedia learning. A small application that runs on a smartphone is called an app. 
Different app development tools are needed for different operating systems (platforms). For 
example, Apple apps are typically developed within the X-code environment in Objective-C 
programming language and can be deployed to iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Another example, 
Android apps, are typically developed in Java language and deployed to Android devices.  

 
Multimedia is defined as ‘presenting both words (e.g., spoken or printed text) and pictures 

(e.g., illustrations, photos, animation, or video).’ The theory of multimedia learning suggests that 
‘people can learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone7. Mayer’s 
cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Sweller’s cognitive load theory and Schnotz’s 
integrative model of text and picture comprehension focus on the process by which people build 
mental representations from words and pictures. Our design of the smartphone apps followed the 
instructional design principles derived from the cognitive load theories. Gamification - the use of 
game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems – 
techniques have been advocated to improve user engagement in a mobile learning environment8. 

 
The key research problem that this project is help us understand how the smartphone apps 

can be best used to assist the learning process and how this understanding can help developers to 
design better apps to assist learning. 

 
3.  Development of the Mobile App “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

In Summer 2012, the authors developed the first version of the Engineering Economics 

mobile app to reinforce and improve the understanding of fundamental principles of Engineering 
Economics through the use of the smart phone apps outside the classroom9. The topics include 
time value of money, cash flow modeling, applications of interest rates, decision making, effects 
of taxes and depreciation. The user interface was a traditional Android or iOS App with five tabs: 
E-book, Calculator, Reference Table, Conceptual Problems and Practice Problems9. It was 
incorporated into the Engineering Economics course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 
2013). 

 
After one year’s formative assessment with undergraduate engineering students, the app was 
renamed as “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”.  The user interface evolved into an educational 
game style, which was one of desired features by students (Figure 1). In order to better support 
different screen resolutions of iPhones and iPads, we adopted a third party graphics library 
Cocos2d10. The app incorporates all the previous components including E-book, calculator, 
reference tables, conceptual problems and practical problems, from the previous version but 
present them in a different and livelier fashion. Figure 1(a) shows the main interface. We add hint 
messages in Figure 1(b) to help explain each icon’s function.

The E-book is a summary of the key concepts of Engineering Economics (Figure 2). Users 
may access this E-book from the main interface (Figure 1), or be directed to the relevant topics 
from a problem (see Figures 7~12).

The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering economics problems with 

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12).

Abstract: This paper presents the mobile application development process and students’ 
satisfaction of the developed app for the Engineering Economics course. The mobile app was 
first designed in Summer 2012, and the app was incorporated into the Engineering Economics 
course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013). The app is named as ‘Engineering 
Economics Jeopardy!’ because it was designed in an educational game style, which was one of 
desired features by students. The app incorporates all the components including E-book, 
calculator, reference tables, conceptual questions and practical problems, in the previous version 
but present them in a different and livelier fashion. The E-book is a summary of the key concepts 
of Engineering Economics. The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering 
economics problems with formulas. The tables allow the users to compute discrete compound 
interest factors. The main interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete 
with two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and 
practical problems. Different sets of problems range from the simple questions on time values of 
money to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and 
Supply Demand Equilibrium. From the competition interface, users may access the relevant 
topics in the E-book and use the calculator and interest tables to help themselves. The mobile app 
has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and they have been 
released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. This app is intended to give students more 
opportunity to learn and practice concepts of Engineering Economics whenever and where they 
want using their mobile devices. 116 students participated in this study. Surveys and interview 
results showed that the majority of the students who used the app said that the app aided their 
learning. 94% of the users said that they would recommend using the app to others who study 
Engineering Economics.

1.  Introduction 
 
Engineering Economics is a core class in the field of engineering and is also covered on the 

Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step to be a Professional Engineer 
(PE). This course teaches skills required to analyze cash flows, costs, and the time value of 
money through various methods and performance measures. The challenge for educators is that 
engineering economic analysis is primarily concerned with problem solving methods that seem 
to be non-intuitive for many students. Alternative teaching methods including Internet integration 
with other courses1, and a mechanics analysis of the cash flows2, have been proposed in the 
literature. At the authors’ university, the performance for the academic year of 2010 shows that 
almost 14% of the students dropped the course and the number went up to 43%, if combined 
with students who failed or obtained a marginal grade D. Consequently, they were required to 
retake the course according to the university policy. Nationwide, Engineering Economics is a 
required course by many engineering disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to design innovative 
instructional approaches for this course to improve student retention in engineering. Based on 
our needs assessment, the students need: 1) more explanation of abstract concepts with better 
illustrations and practical scenarios; 2) more communication channels for interaction with the 
instructor and amongst classmates; 3) a ubiquitous access to learning materials at their own pace.  

 

Smartphone apps can potentially help today’s students by providing ubiquitous access to 

multimedia learning materials along with more channels for interaction. A smartphone is a 
mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary 
basic feature phone. Smartphones run complete operating system software, providing a platform 
for application developers. Apple iOS and Google Android are two examples of popular 
smartphone platforms. Today, smartphones offer multi-touch screen interfaces featuring many 
small apps with different functions. Some of these small apps are educational applications via 
online market places, such as the Android Play store and the Apple App store. At the time of our 
proposal writing in 2010, no suitable apps were available in the stores. Currently there are a few 
simple apps serving as calculators and interest tables. We have developed an app with a much 
more comprehensive coverage that allows students to learn most of the Engineering Economics 
key concepts. In addition, it has been updated though one year’s formative assessment with 
university students. 

 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces research background 

information. Section 3 explains our published mobile apps, “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”. 
Section 4 discusses the student satisfaction of the current app. Section 5 concludes the paper and 
suggests future work.   

 

 

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey 

these concepts5. The instructor reports that very frequently students confounded time value of 
money with inflation. 

 
Since personal computers became available in homes and schools, development in 

educational technology has progressed at an accelerated pace6. In this paper, we focus on mobile 
apps for multimedia learning. A small application that runs on a smartphone is called an app. 
Different app development tools are needed for different operating systems (platforms). For 
example, Apple apps are typically developed within the X-code environment in Objective-C 
programming language and can be deployed to iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Another example, 
Android apps, are typically developed in Java language and deployed to Android devices.  

 
Multimedia is defined as ‘presenting both words (e.g., spoken or printed text) and pictures 

(e.g., illustrations, photos, animation, or video).’ The theory of multimedia learning suggests that 
‘people can learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone7. Mayer’s 
cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Sweller’s cognitive load theory and Schnotz’s 
integrative model of text and picture comprehension focus on the process by which people build 
mental representations from words and pictures. Our design of the smartphone apps followed the 
instructional design principles derived from the cognitive load theories. Gamification - the use of 
game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems – 
techniques have been advocated to improve user engagement in a mobile learning environment8. 

 
The key research problem that this project is help us understand how the smartphone apps 

can be best used to assist the learning process and how this understanding can help developers to 
design better apps to assist learning. 

 
3.  Development of the Mobile App “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

In Summer 2012, the authors developed the first version of the Engineering Economics 

mobile app to reinforce and improve the understanding of fundamental principles of Engineering 
Economics through the use of the smart phone apps outside the classroom9. The topics include 
time value of money, cash flow modeling, applications of interest rates, decision making, effects 
of taxes and depreciation. The user interface was a traditional Android or iOS App with five tabs: 
E-book, Calculator, Reference Table, Conceptual Problems and Practice Problems9. It was 
incorporated into the Engineering Economics course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 
2013). 

 
After one year’s formative assessment with undergraduate engineering students, the app was 
renamed as “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”.  The user interface evolved into an educational 
game style, which was one of desired features by students (Figure 1). In order to better support 
different screen resolutions of iPhones and iPads, we adopted a third party graphics library 
Cocos2d10. The app incorporates all the previous components including E-book, calculator, 
reference tables, conceptual problems and practical problems, from the previous version but 
present them in a different and livelier fashion. Figure 1(a) shows the main interface. We add hint 
messages in Figure 1(b) to help explain each icon’s function.

The E-book is a summary of the key concepts of Engineering Economics (Figure 2). Users 
may access this E-book from the main interface (Figure 1), or be directed to the relevant topics 
from a problem (see Figures 7~12). 

 

Figure 2. Engineering Economics E-Book 

 

The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering economics problems with 

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12).

The reference tables allow the users to compute discrete compound interest factors (Figure 

4). Users may change the interest rate and years to see different tables as needed in solving their 
problems. 

 

Figure 4. Engineering Economics Reference Tables 

 

 

 
The main game interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete with 
two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and practical 
problems (Figure 5). Before users attempt the game, they may try with training sessions first 
(Figure 6). The training has the similar problems and setup as in the game but users are not under 
timer pressure, because users are allowed to continue to work on the problem even if timer 
expires. The training has three rounds. Each round has 10 conceptual problems and 20 practical 
problems. The problems in the training are similar to the real game but the options sequence and 
question parameters are randomized. So each time users will see different questions.

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12).

The main game interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete with 
two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and practical 
problems (Figure 5). Before users attempt the game, they may try with training sessions first 
(Figure 6). The training has the similar problems and setup as in the game but users are not under 
timer pressure, because users are allowed to continue to work on the problem even if timer 
expires. The training has three rounds. Each round has 10 conceptual problems and 20 practical 
problems. The problems in the training are similar to the real game but the options sequence and 
question parameters are randomized. So each time users will see different questions.

Abstract: This paper presents the mobile application development process and students’ 
satisfaction of the developed app for the Engineering Economics course. The mobile app was 
first designed in Summer 2012, and the app was incorporated into the Engineering Economics 
course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013). The app is named as ‘Engineering 
Economics Jeopardy!’ because it was designed in an educational game style, which was one of 
desired features by students. The app incorporates all the components including E-book, 
calculator, reference tables, conceptual questions and practical problems, in the previous version 
but present them in a different and livelier fashion. The E-book is a summary of the key concepts 
of Engineering Economics. The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering 
economics problems with formulas. The tables allow the users to compute discrete compound 
interest factors. The main interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete 
with two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and 
practical problems. Different sets of problems range from the simple questions on time values of 
money to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and 
Supply Demand Equilibrium. From the competition interface, users may access the relevant 
topics in the E-book and use the calculator and interest tables to help themselves. The mobile app 
has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and they have been 
released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. This app is intended to give students more 
opportunity to learn and practice concepts of Engineering Economics whenever and where they 
want using their mobile devices. 116 students participated in this study. Surveys and interview 
results showed that the majority of the students who used the app said that the app aided their 
learning. 94% of the users said that they would recommend using the app to others who study 
Engineering Economics.

1.  Introduction 
 
Engineering Economics is a core class in the field of engineering and is also covered on the 

Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step to be a Professional Engineer 
(PE). This course teaches skills required to analyze cash flows, costs, and the time value of 
money through various methods and performance measures. The challenge for educators is that 
engineering economic analysis is primarily concerned with problem solving methods that seem 
to be non-intuitive for many students. Alternative teaching methods including Internet integration 
with other courses1, and a mechanics analysis of the cash flows2, have been proposed in the 
literature. At the authors’ university, the performance for the academic year of 2010 shows that 
almost 14% of the students dropped the course and the number went up to 43%, if combined 
with students who failed or obtained a marginal grade D. Consequently, they were required to 
retake the course according to the university policy. Nationwide, Engineering Economics is a 
required course by many engineering disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to design innovative 
instructional approaches for this course to improve student retention in engineering. Based on 
our needs assessment, the students need: 1) more explanation of abstract concepts with better 
illustrations and practical scenarios; 2) more communication channels for interaction with the 
instructor and amongst classmates; 3) a ubiquitous access to learning materials at their own pace.  

 

Smartphone apps can potentially help today’s students by providing ubiquitous access to 

multimedia learning materials along with more channels for interaction. A smartphone is a 
mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary 
basic feature phone. Smartphones run complete operating system software, providing a platform 
for application developers. Apple iOS and Google Android are two examples of popular 
smartphone platforms. Today, smartphones offer multi-touch screen interfaces featuring many 
small apps with different functions. Some of these small apps are educational applications via 
online market places, such as the Android Play store and the Apple App store. At the time of our 
proposal writing in 2010, no suitable apps were available in the stores. Currently there are a few 
simple apps serving as calculators and interest tables. We have developed an app with a much 
more comprehensive coverage that allows students to learn most of the Engineering Economics 
key concepts. In addition, it has been updated though one year’s formative assessment with 
university students. 

 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces research background 

information. Section 3 explains our published mobile apps, “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”. 
Section 4 discusses the student satisfaction of the current app. Section 5 concludes the paper and 
suggests future work.   

 

 

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey 

these concepts5. The instructor reports that very frequently students confounded time value of 
money with inflation. 

 
Since personal computers became available in homes and schools, development in 

educational technology has progressed at an accelerated pace6. In this paper, we focus on mobile 
apps for multimedia learning. A small application that runs on a smartphone is called an app. 
Different app development tools are needed for different operating systems (platforms). For 
example, Apple apps are typically developed within the X-code environment in Objective-C 
programming language and can be deployed to iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Another example, 
Android apps, are typically developed in Java language and deployed to Android devices.  

 
Multimedia is defined as ‘presenting both words (e.g., spoken or printed text) and pictures 

(e.g., illustrations, photos, animation, or video).’ The theory of multimedia learning suggests that 
‘people can learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone7. Mayer’s 
cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Sweller’s cognitive load theory and Schnotz’s 
integrative model of text and picture comprehension focus on the process by which people build 
mental representations from words and pictures. Our design of the smartphone apps followed the 
instructional design principles derived from the cognitive load theories. Gamification - the use of 
game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems – 
techniques have been advocated to improve user engagement in a mobile learning environment8. 

 
The key research problem that this project is help us understand how the smartphone apps 

can be best used to assist the learning process and how this understanding can help developers to 
design better apps to assist learning. 

 
3.  Development of the Mobile App “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

In Summer 2012, the authors developed the first version of the Engineering Economics 

mobile app to reinforce and improve the understanding of fundamental principles of Engineering 
Economics through the use of the smart phone apps outside the classroom9. The topics include 
time value of money, cash flow modeling, applications of interest rates, decision making, effects 
of taxes and depreciation. The user interface was a traditional Android or iOS App with five tabs: 
E-book, Calculator, Reference Table, Conceptual Problems and Practice Problems9. It was 
incorporated into the Engineering Economics course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 
2013). 

 
After one year’s formative assessment with undergraduate engineering students, the app was 
renamed as “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”.  The user interface evolved into an educational 
game style, which was one of desired features by students (Figure 1). In order to better support 
different screen resolutions of iPhones and iPads, we adopted a third party graphics library 
Cocos2d10. The app incorporates all the previous components including E-book, calculator, 
reference tables, conceptual problems and practical problems, from the previous version but 
present them in a different and livelier fashion. Figure 1(a) shows the main interface. We add hint 
messages in Figure 1(b) to help explain each icon’s function.

Figure 1. The Main Interface of “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

 

The E-book is a summary of the key concepts of Engineering Economics (Figure 2). Users 
may access this E-book from the main interface (Figure 1), or be directed to the relevant topics 
from a problem (see Figures 7~12). 

 

Figure 2. Engineering Economics E-Book 

 

The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering economics problems with 

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12).

The reference tables allow the users to compute discrete compound interest factors (Figure 

4). Users may change the interest rate and years to see different tables as needed in solving their 
problems.

The main game interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete with 
two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and practical 
problems (Figure 5). Before users attempt the game, they may try with training sessions first 
(Figure 6). The training has the similar problems and setup as in the game but users are not under 
timer pressure, because users are allowed to continue to work on the problem even if timer 
expires. The training has three rounds. Each round has 10 conceptual problems and 20 practical 
problems. The problems in the training are similar to the real game but the options sequence and 
question parameters are randomized. So each time users will see different questions.

Conceptual problems will check the users’ understanding of fundamental concepts in 

Engineering Economics, starting from the basic algebra equations to more advanced concepts 
(Figure 7).  

 
Different sets of practical problems range from the simple questions on time value of money 

(Figure 8) to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 9), Project 
Alternatives (Figure 10), Monte Carlo Simulation (Figure 11) for risk assessment, and Supply 
Demand Equilibrium (Figure 12). These complex problems are accompanied with graphs. From 
the competition interface, users may access the relevant topics in the E-book and use the 
calculator and interest tables to help themselves. After repeated training, users are expected to get 
more familiar with relevant topics and solution procedures.

Students have access to more than forty videos produced for delivery of an online course 

(Figure 13).  While most of the topics are covered, more videos are still in production to solve 
sample problems or cover more detail material as we see fit according to the students’ feedback. 
Each video is about 10 minutes long, on specific topics, and is close captioned. The videos are 
uploaded to a private video streaming service that is paid by the University. With the data and 
video playing capabilities of smart phones, students have the possibility of not only practicing 
problems or reading a text book, but also being engaged as class attendants in an asynchronous 
lecture at their convenience. We constantly receive good review due to the fact the videos are 
short and to the point, reducing the distractions that students typically have when learning from 
long video lectures.

The mobile app has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and 
they have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. The two app implementations 
are different but the contents are essentially the same. The above narration referred to the iOS 
app version. The following figures illustrate a few screenshots of the Android app version 
(Figure 14). The apps have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store for free 
download. The app name is ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’.

first designed in Summer 2012, and the app was incorporated into the Engineering Economics 
course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013). The app is named as ‘Engineering 
Economics Jeopardy!’ because it was designed in an educational game style, which was one of 
desired features by students. The app incorporates all the components including E-book, 
calculator, reference tables, conceptual questions and practical problems, in the previous version 
but present them in a different and livelier fashion. The E-book is a summary of the key concepts 
of Engineering Economics. The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering 
economics problems with formulas. The tables allow the users to compute discrete compound 
interest factors. The main interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete 
with two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and 
practical problems. Different sets of problems range from the simple questions on time values of 
money to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and 
Supply Demand Equilibrium. From the competition interface, users may access the relevant 
topics in the E-book and use the calculator and interest tables to help themselves. The mobile app 
has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and they have been 
released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. This app is intended to give students more 
opportunity to learn and practice concepts of Engineering Economics whenever and where they 
want using their mobile devices. 116 students participated in this study. Surveys and interview 
results showed that the majority of the students who used the app said that the app aided their 
learning. 94% of the users said that they would recommend using the app to others who study 
Engineering Economics.

1.  Introduction 
 
Engineering Economics is a core class in the field of engineering and is also covered on the 

Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step to be a Professional Engineer 
(PE). This course teaches skills required to analyze cash flows, costs, and the time value of 
money through various methods and performance measures. The challenge for educators is that 
engineering economic analysis is primarily concerned with problem solving methods that seem 
to be non-intuitive for many students. Alternative teaching methods including Internet integration 
with other courses1, and a mechanics analysis of the cash flows2, have been proposed in the 
literature. At the authors’ university, the performance for the academic year of 2010 shows that 
almost 14% of the students dropped the course and the number went up to 43%, if combined 
with students who failed or obtained a marginal grade D. Consequently, they were required to 
retake the course according to the university policy. Nationwide, Engineering Economics is a 
required course by many engineering disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to design innovative 
instructional approaches for this course to improve student retention in engineering. Based on 
our needs assessment, the students need: 1) more explanation of abstract concepts with better 
illustrations and practical scenarios; 2) more communication channels for interaction with the 
instructor and amongst classmates; 3) a ubiquitous access to learning materials at their own pace.  

 

Smartphone apps can potentially help today’s students by providing ubiquitous access to 

multimedia learning materials along with more channels for interaction. A smartphone is a 
mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary 
basic feature phone. Smartphones run complete operating system software, providing a platform 
for application developers. Apple iOS and Google Android are two examples of popular 
smartphone platforms. Today, smartphones offer multi-touch screen interfaces featuring many 
small apps with different functions. Some of these small apps are educational applications via 
online market places, such as the Android Play store and the Apple App store. At the time of our 
proposal writing in 2010, no suitable apps were available in the stores. Currently there are a few 
simple apps serving as calculators and interest tables. We have developed an app with a much 
more comprehensive coverage that allows students to learn most of the Engineering Economics 
key concepts. In addition, it has been updated though one year’s formative assessment with 
university students. 

 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces research background 

information. Section 3 explains our published mobile apps, “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”. 
Section 4 discusses the student satisfaction of the current app. Section 5 concludes the paper and 
suggests future work.   

 

 

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey 

these concepts5. The instructor reports that very frequently students confounded time value of 
money with inflation. 

 
Since personal computers became available in homes and schools, development in 

educational technology has progressed at an accelerated pace6. In this paper, we focus on mobile 
apps for multimedia learning. A small application that runs on a smartphone is called an app. 
Different app development tools are needed for different operating systems (platforms). For 
example, Apple apps are typically developed within the X-code environment in Objective-C 
programming language and can be deployed to iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Another example, 
Android apps, are typically developed in Java language and deployed to Android devices.  

 
Multimedia is defined as ‘presenting both words (e.g., spoken or printed text) and pictures 

(e.g., illustrations, photos, animation, or video).’ The theory of multimedia learning suggests that 
‘people can learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone7. Mayer’s 
cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Sweller’s cognitive load theory and Schnotz’s 
integrative model of text and picture comprehension focus on the process by which people build 
mental representations from words and pictures. Our design of the smartphone apps followed the 
instructional design principles derived from the cognitive load theories. Gamification - the use of 
game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems – 
techniques have been advocated to improve user engagement in a mobile learning environment8. 

 
The key research problem that this project is help us understand how the smartphone apps 

can be best used to assist the learning process and how this understanding can help developers to 
design better apps to assist learning. 

 
3.  Development of the Mobile App “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

In Summer 2012, the authors developed the first version of the Engineering Economics 

mobile app to reinforce and improve the understanding of fundamental principles of Engineering 
Economics through the use of the smart phone apps outside the classroom9. The topics include 
time value of money, cash flow modeling, applications of interest rates, decision making, effects 
of taxes and depreciation. The user interface was a traditional Android or iOS App with five tabs: 
E-book, Calculator, Reference Table, Conceptual Problems and Practice Problems9. It was 
incorporated into the Engineering Economics course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 
2013). 

 
After one year’s formative assessment with undergraduate engineering students, the app was 
renamed as “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”.  The user interface evolved into an educational 
game style, which was one of desired features by students (Figure 1). In order to better support 
different screen resolutions of iPhones and iPads, we adopted a third party graphics library 
Cocos2d10. The app incorporates all the previous components including E-book, calculator, 
reference tables, conceptual problems and practical problems, from the previous version but 
present them in a different and livelier fashion. Figure 1(a) shows the main interface. We add hint 
messages in Figure 1(b) to help explain each icon’s function. 

(a)  The Main Interface 

(b) The Main Interface with Interpretation 

Figure 1. The Main Interface of “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

 

The E-book is a summary of the key concepts of Engineering Economics (Figure 2). Users 
may access this E-book from the main interface (Figure 1), or be directed to the relevant topics 
from a problem (see Figures 7~12). 

 

Figure 2. Engineering Economics E-Book 

 

The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering economics problems with 

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12). 

Figure 3. Engineering Economics Calculator 

 

 

The reference tables allow the users to compute discrete compound interest factors (Figure 

4). Users may change the interest rate and years to see different tables as needed in solving their 
problems. 

 

Figure 4. Engineering Economics Reference Tables 

 

 

 
The main game interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete with 
two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and practical 
problems (Figure 5). Before users attempt the game, they may try with training sessions first 
(Figure 6). The training has the similar problems and setup as in the game but users are not under 
timer pressure, because users are allowed to continue to work on the problem even if timer 
expires. The training has three rounds. Each round has 10 conceptual problems and 20 practical 
problems. The problems in the training are similar to the real game but the options sequence and 
question parameters are randomized. So each time users will see different questions.  

 

Figure 5. “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” Game Competition Interface 

 

 

Figure 6. Game Training Interface 

 

 

 

Conceptual problems will check the users’ understanding of fundamental concepts in 

Engineering Economics, starting from the basic algebra equations to more advanced concepts 
(Figure 7).  

 
Different sets of practical problems range from the simple questions on time value of money 

(Figure 8) to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 9), Project 
Alternatives (Figure 10), Monte Carlo Simulation (Figure 11) for risk assessment, and Supply 
Demand Equilibrium (Figure 12). These complex problems are accompanied with graphs. From 
the competition interface, users may access the relevant topics in the E-book and use the 
calculator and interest tables to help themselves. After repeated training, users are expected to get 
more familiar with relevant topics and solution procedures.

Students have access to more than forty videos produced for delivery of an online course 

(Figure 13).  While most of the topics are covered, more videos are still in production to solve 
sample problems or cover more detail material as we see fit according to the students’ feedback. 
Each video is about 10 minutes long, on specific topics, and is close captioned. The videos are 
uploaded to a private video streaming service that is paid by the University. With the data and 
video playing capabilities of smart phones, students have the possibility of not only practicing 
problems or reading a text book, but also being engaged as class attendants in an asynchronous 
lecture at their convenience. We constantly receive good review due to the fact the videos are 
short and to the point, reducing the distractions that students typically have when learning from 
long video lectures. 

 

Figure 13. Example: Video Lectures Delivered through the E-book Links 

 
The mobile app has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and 
they have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. The two app implementations 
are different but the contents are essentially the same. The above narration referred to the iOS 
app version. The following figures illustrate a few screenshots of the Android app version 
(Figure 14). The apps have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store for free 
download. The app name is ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’.

4.  Student Satisfaction Assessment Results 
 
To see the effectiveness of our developed mobile application and its implementation in 

teaching and learning, we have conducted pre and post assessment with the student participants. 
In pre-assessment, students were asked to share their preference and current use of technology 
through online surveys. In post-assessment, students’ perceived effectiveness of the app and their 
learning experience with the app were assessed through interviews and online surveys. The pre-
assessment was conducted at the beginning of the semester, and the post-assessment was 
conducted toward the end of the semester. 

 
A total of 116 students (59.4% White/Caucasian, 16.4% African American, 13.8% Hispanic, 

8.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, .9% Native American, 0.9 % other racial backgrounds) who were 
enrolled in Engineering Economics course participated in the study for extra course credit. A 
majority of the respondents were male (79.3%). Participants included 5 freshmen, 30 
sophomores, 52 juniors, and 31 seniors, and their mean age was 23.2 (SD = 3.7; range 18-34). 
Almost half of the students (51.7%) indicated that they were employed, and 31% of them 
specified that their work was not academically relevant at all. 

 
Many (87%) students indicated that they had their own smartphones. Regarding their use and 

preference of technology in their learning, the majority of students (90.5%) said that they 
enjoyed using technology, and 82.7% of them believed use of technology could enhance their 
learning. More than half of the students (62.9%) also indicated that an instructor’s use of 
technology in teaching could help them learn better. However, 30.2% of students specifically 
indicated that they preferred a traditional lecture format with no or minimum technology for their 
classroom learning. 

 
Regarding the developed smartphone application, students seemed to like the idea of utilizing 
their readily available tool for their learning. Below is an interview snippet from one student who 
expressed enthusiasm about using the app: 

 

“It’s kind of cool! Being able to have something else that helps me because I use my 
phone every single day. With the app, I could just be about anywhere to study. Say, if I 
have a break time at work, I just sit there and just pull out the app and see if I could do 
anything else instead of just sitting there.” 
 
Of the smartphone app users, 63% students reported that the use of the app was helpful 

for their learning. It is noteworthy that student satisfaction of the app went up from the first 
semester (46.43%) to the second semester (80.56%) of this research project. In fact, 35% of the 
app user in the first semester said that they would recommend using the app to others who take 
the Engineering Economics course, and the percent went up to 94% in the second semester. In 
the first semester, the students used the first version of the app. In the second semester, the app 
has been updated to ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’ We attribute the positive change of 
student experience to this app upgrade. Across two semesters, students reported that repeated 
practice of problems and problem solving skills as two most helpful features of the app.

phone every single day. With the app, I could just be about anywhere to study. Say, if I 
have a break time at work, I just sit there and just pull out the app and see if I could do 
anything else instead of just sitting there.” 
 
Of the smartphone app users, 63% students reported that the use of the app was helpful 

for their learning. It is noteworthy that student satisfaction of the app went up from the first 
semester (46.43%) to the second semester (80.56%) of this research project. In fact, 35% of the 
app user in the first semester said that they would recommend using the app to others who take 
the Engineering Economics course, and the percent went up to 94% in the second semester. In 
the first semester, the students used the first version of the app. In the second semester, the app 
has been updated to ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’ We attribute the positive change of 
student experience to this app upgrade. Across two semesters, students reported that repeated 
practice of problems and problem solving skills as two most helpful features of the app. 

 

5.  Discussion and Conclusion 

 

Our study findings show that students are very enthusiastic about using their smartphone as 

their learning tool, and generally students find their smartphone app helpful for their learning, 
especially in Engineering Economics course. Considering the exponentially growing smartphone 
users among students, adopting smartphone apps into teaching seems like a timely step for 
college instructors, especially for those who teach subject areas that students typically struggle 
with. Yet, many students reported that up until this time, they never encountered instructors who 
used a smartphone app for course lessons. As with any innovative approaches, effectively 
incorporating smartphone apps into teaching is not an easy task. Our study findings showed that 
when students did not see clear benefit of using the app, they just stopped using it. For example, 
if using the app does not lead to their higher course grades, students quickly lose interest in using 
the app. 

 
Students were interested in using the app to solve problems during the in-class activities. 

Some students preferred using the app for computing the compound factors and generating 
tables. Upon students’ requests, the course instructor permitted students to use the app during 
exams. Complex exams keep students solving the exam, instead of seeking external help during 
the test time through the mobile network. The easily accessible nature of the app, which only 
requires a click of a button, seemed to attract a higher number of students to pull out relevant 
materials with ease as appose to traditional textbooks or course materials. The students feel 
invigorated now that higher grades are within reach if they spend more time in practicing with 
the app. In addition to using the app as a readily available resource for individual study, students 
also seemed to find the app useful for in-class discussions, peer to peer review of problems and 
peer tutoring. 

 
Overall, students have shown a strong interest in using mobile apps that can assist their 

learning, and we believe that our findings behoove educators and researchers to develop and 
utilize smartphone applications because of its great potential to be used as a learning tool. 
Regarding the development of a mobile app for an Engineering Economics course, our improved 
app has reflected the feedback from the student users and implemented many modules to help 
students reinforce the key concepts and improve their problem-solving skills. The app has been 
made available freely through Apple App store and Google Play. We will continue to pursue 
formative assessment and improvement during the NSF grant period.

Abstract: This paper presents the mobile application development process and students’ 
satisfaction of the developed app for the Engineering Economics course. The mobile app was 
first designed in Summer 2012, and the app was incorporated into the Engineering Economics 
course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013). The app is named as ‘Engineering 
Economics Jeopardy!’ because it was designed in an educational game style, which was one of 
desired features by students. The app incorporates all the components including E-book, 
calculator, reference tables, conceptual questions and practical problems, in the previous version 
but present them in a different and livelier fashion. The E-book is a summary of the key concepts 
of Engineering Economics. The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering 
economics problems with formulas. The tables allow the users to compute discrete compound 
interest factors. The main interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete 
with two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and 
practical problems. Different sets of problems range from the simple questions on time values of 
money to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and 
Supply Demand Equilibrium. From the competition interface, users may access the relevant 
topics in the E-book and use the calculator and interest tables to help themselves. The mobile app 
has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and they have been 
released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. This app is intended to give students more 
opportunity to learn and practice concepts of Engineering Economics whenever and where they 
want using their mobile devices. 116 students participated in this study. Surveys and interview 
results showed that the majority of the students who used the app said that the app aided their 
learning. 94% of the users said that they would recommend using the app to others who study 
Engineering Economics.

1.  Introduction 
 
Engineering Economics is a core class in the field of engineering and is also covered on the 

Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step to be a Professional Engineer 
(PE). This course teaches skills required to analyze cash flows, costs, and the time value of 
money through various methods and performance measures. The challenge for educators is that 
engineering economic analysis is primarily concerned with problem solving methods that seem 
to be non-intuitive for many students. Alternative teaching methods including Internet integration 
with other courses1, and a mechanics analysis of the cash flows2, have been proposed in the 
literature. At the authors’ university, the performance for the academic year of 2010 shows that 
almost 14% of the students dropped the course and the number went up to 43%, if combined 
with students who failed or obtained a marginal grade D. Consequently, they were required to 
retake the course according to the university policy. Nationwide, Engineering Economics is a 
required course by many engineering disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to design innovative 
instructional approaches for this course to improve student retention in engineering. Based on 
our needs assessment, the students need: 1) more explanation of abstract concepts with better 
illustrations and practical scenarios; 2) more communication channels for interaction with the 
instructor and amongst classmates; 3) a ubiquitous access to learning materials at their own pace.  

 

Smartphone apps can potentially help today’s students by providing ubiquitous access to 

multimedia learning materials along with more channels for interaction. A smartphone is a 
mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary 
basic feature phone. Smartphones run complete operating system software, providing a platform 
for application developers. Apple iOS and Google Android are two examples of popular 
smartphone platforms. Today, smartphones offer multi-touch screen interfaces featuring many 
small apps with different functions. Some of these small apps are educational applications via 
online market places, such as the Android Play store and the Apple App store. At the time of our 
proposal writing in 2010, no suitable apps were available in the stores. Currently there are a few 
simple apps serving as calculators and interest tables. We have developed an app with a much 
more comprehensive coverage that allows students to learn most of the Engineering Economics 
key concepts. In addition, it has been updated though one year’s formative assessment with 
university students. 

 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces research background 

information. Section 3 explains our published mobile apps, “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”. 
Section 4 discusses the student satisfaction of the current app. Section 5 concludes the paper and 
suggests future work.   

 

 

2.  Research Background 

Engineering Economics concepts are not intuitively clear for engineering students since they 
are required to understand the concept of giving different values to the same amount of money if 
considered at different times. Research indicates that students have a difficulty in developing the 
deep-level understanding required to achieve insight into the principles and rules underlying 
specific facts or results3. To address the difficulties, instructors have been pursuing different 
teaching aids such as project-based learning4 and simulation and multimedia to help convey 

these concepts5. The instructor reports that very frequently students confounded time value of 
money with inflation. 

 
Since personal computers became available in homes and schools, development in 

educational technology has progressed at an accelerated pace6. In this paper, we focus on mobile 
apps for multimedia learning. A small application that runs on a smartphone is called an app. 
Different app development tools are needed for different operating systems (platforms). For 
example, Apple apps are typically developed within the X-code environment in Objective-C 
programming language and can be deployed to iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Another example, 
Android apps, are typically developed in Java language and deployed to Android devices.  

 
Multimedia is defined as ‘presenting both words (e.g., spoken or printed text) and pictures 

(e.g., illustrations, photos, animation, or video).’ The theory of multimedia learning suggests that 
‘people can learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone7. Mayer’s 
cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Sweller’s cognitive load theory and Schnotz’s 
integrative model of text and picture comprehension focus on the process by which people build 
mental representations from words and pictures. Our design of the smartphone apps followed the 
instructional design principles derived from the cognitive load theories. Gamification - the use of 
game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems – 
techniques have been advocated to improve user engagement in a mobile learning environment8. 

 
The key research problem that this project is help us understand how the smartphone apps 

can be best used to assist the learning process and how this understanding can help developers to 
design better apps to assist learning. 

 
3.  Development of the Mobile App “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

In Summer 2012, the authors developed the first version of the Engineering Economics 

mobile app to reinforce and improve the understanding of fundamental principles of Engineering 
Economics through the use of the smart phone apps outside the classroom9. The topics include 
time value of money, cash flow modeling, applications of interest rates, decision making, effects 
of taxes and depreciation. The user interface was a traditional Android or iOS App with five tabs: 
E-book, Calculator, Reference Table, Conceptual Problems and Practice Problems9. It was 
incorporated into the Engineering Economics course in two long semesters (Fall 2012 and Spring 
2013). 

 
After one year’s formative assessment with undergraduate engineering students, the app was 
renamed as “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!”.  The user interface evolved into an educational 
game style, which was one of desired features by students (Figure 1). In order to better support 
different screen resolutions of iPhones and iPads, we adopted a third party graphics library 
Cocos2d10. The app incorporates all the previous components including E-book, calculator, 
reference tables, conceptual problems and practical problems, from the previous version but 
present them in a different and livelier fashion. Figure 1(a) shows the main interface. We add hint 
messages in Figure 1(b) to help explain each icon’s function.

(b) The Main Interface with Interpretation 

Figure 1. The Main Interface of “Engineering Economics Jeopardy!” 

 

 

The E-book is a summary of the key concepts of Engineering Economics (Figure 2). Users 
may access this E-book from the main interface (Figure 1), or be directed to the relevant topics 
from a problem (see Figures 7~12). 

 

Figure 2. Engineering Economics E-Book 

 

The calculator provides functions to solve basic engineering economics problems with 

formulas (Figure 3). There formulas are the most frequently used ones in the courses. Users may 
use them to help them solve more complex problems as part of whole solution procedures. Users 
may access them directly from the main interface (Figure 1), or from a problem (Figures 7~12). 

Figure 3. Engineering Economics Calculator 

 

 

The reference tables allow the users to compute discrete compound interest factors (Figure 

4). Users may change the interest rate and years to see different tables as needed in solving their 
problems. 

 

Figure 4. Engineering Economics Reference Tables 

 

 

 
The main game interface is a Jeopardy! Game. Through this game, users can compete with 
two virtual opponents with Artificial Intelligence to answer conceptual questions and practical 
problems (Figure 5). Before users attempt the game, they may try with training sessions first 
(Figure 6). The training has the similar problems and setup as in the game but users are not under 
timer pressure, because users are allowed to continue to work on the problem even if timer 
expires. The training has three rounds. Each round has 10 conceptual problems and 20 practical 
problems. The problems in the training are similar to the real game but the options sequence and 
question parameters are randomized. So each time users will see different questions.

Figure 6. Game Training Interface 

 

 

 

Conceptual problems will check the users’ understanding of fundamental concepts in 

Engineering Economics, starting from the basic algebra equations to more advanced concepts 
(Figure 7).  

 
Different sets of practical problems range from the simple questions on time value of money 

(Figure 8) to more complex concepts, such as Sensitivity Analysis (Figure 9), Project 
Alternatives (Figure 10), Monte Carlo Simulation (Figure 11) for risk assessment, and Supply 
Demand Equilibrium (Figure 12). These complex problems are accompanied with graphs. From 
the competition interface, users may access the relevant topics in the E-book and use the 
calculator and interest tables to help themselves. After repeated training, users are expected to get 
more familiar with relevant topics and solution procedures.

Students have access to more than forty videos produced for delivery of an online course 

(Figure 13).  While most of the topics are covered, more videos are still in production to solve 
sample problems or cover more detail material as we see fit according to the students’ feedback. 
Each video is about 10 minutes long, on specific topics, and is close captioned. The videos are 
uploaded to a private video streaming service that is paid by the University. With the data and 
video playing capabilities of smart phones, students have the possibility of not only practicing 
problems or reading a text book, but also being engaged as class attendants in an asynchronous 
lecture at their convenience. We constantly receive good review due to the fact the videos are 
short and to the point, reducing the distractions that students typically have when learning from 
long video lectures.

The mobile app has been developed for both Apple iOS and Google Android platforms, and 
they have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store. The two app implementations 
are different but the contents are essentially the same. The above narration referred to the iOS 
app version. The following figures illustrate a few screenshots of the Android app version 
(Figure 14). The apps have been released in the Google Play and Apple App Store for free 
download. The app name is ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’.

4.  Student Satisfaction Assessment Results 
 
To see the effectiveness of our developed mobile application and its implementation in 

teaching and learning, we have conducted pre and post assessment with the student participants. 
In pre-assessment, students were asked to share their preference and current use of technology 
through online surveys. In post-assessment, students’ perceived effectiveness of the app and their 
learning experience with the app were assessed through interviews and online surveys. The pre-
assessment was conducted at the beginning of the semester, and the post-assessment was 
conducted toward the end of the semester. 

 
A total of 116 students (59.4% White/Caucasian, 16.4% African American, 13.8% Hispanic, 

8.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, .9% Native American, 0.9 % other racial backgrounds) who were 
enrolled in Engineering Economics course participated in the study for extra course credit. A 
majority of the respondents were male (79.3%). Participants included 5 freshmen, 30 
sophomores, 52 juniors, and 31 seniors, and their mean age was 23.2 (SD = 3.7; range 18-34). 
Almost half of the students (51.7%) indicated that they were employed, and 31% of them 
specified that their work was not academically relevant at all. 

 
Many (87%) students indicated that they had their own smartphones. Regarding their use and 

preference of technology in their learning, the majority of students (90.5%) said that they 
enjoyed using technology, and 82.7% of them believed use of technology could enhance their 
learning. More than half of the students (62.9%) also indicated that an instructor’s use of 
technology in teaching could help them learn better. However, 30.2% of students specifically 
indicated that they preferred a traditional lecture format with no or minimum technology for their 
classroom learning. 

 
Regarding the developed smartphone application, students seemed to like the idea of utilizing 
their readily available tool for their learning. Below is an interview snippet from one student who 
expressed enthusiasm about using the app: 

 

“It’s kind of cool! Being able to have something else that helps me because I use my 
phone every single day. With the app, I could just be about anywhere to study. Say, if I 
have a break time at work, I just sit there and just pull out the app and see if I could do 
anything else instead of just sitting there.” 
 
Of the smartphone app users, 63% students reported that the use of the app was helpful 

for their learning. It is noteworthy that student satisfaction of the app went up from the first 
semester (46.43%) to the second semester (80.56%) of this research project. In fact, 35% of the 
app user in the first semester said that they would recommend using the app to others who take 
the Engineering Economics course, and the percent went up to 94% in the second semester. In 
the first semester, the students used the first version of the app. In the second semester, the app 
has been updated to ‘Engineering Economics Jeopardy!’ We attribute the positive change of 
student experience to this app upgrade. Across two semesters, students reported that repeated 
practice of problems and problem solving skills as two most helpful features of the app.
