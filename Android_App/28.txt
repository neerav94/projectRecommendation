W. K. Obeidy, H. Arshad, and B. Parhizkar 

Abstract— Due to advancements in the mobile world and the presence of various strong mobile platforms (Android, IOS, 
Symbian), it is now possible to make use of the revolutionizing Augmented Reality (AR) technology in mobile devices. This 
paper presents a short review of concepts of augmented reality and different features and techniques used in previous 
researches in the field of mobile augmented reality such as tracking, rendering of graphics and the visualization of data required 
in order to develop an advance business card system. It was found that few simpler AR and Quick Response (QR) code 
systems exist independently for business cards but do not co-exist together. The core concept of the research is to successfully 
combine the QR code and the AR and to visualize the virtual 2D & 3D information which in turn displays on mobile phone 
screen by using AR technology. This work will present us an opportunity to understand and discuss how systems using these 
advanced technologies can shape today’s business and communication systems.

considered as an extension or a variation of virtual 
reality. It lets users to experience a new world where the 
real  world  is  composited  or  superimposed  with  the 
virtual  objects  upon  it  and  therefore  it  acts  so  as  to 
supplement the reality, rather than completely replacing 
it  [1].  AR  requires  Head  Mounted  Displays  (HMD)  and 
tangible  interface  objects  which  has  the  ability  for  Six 
Degree  of  Freedom  (6DOF)  pose  tracking  to  assure  that 
there is inexpensive pose tracking, stability in robust and

Recently, the smart phones have gained tremendous 
attention for their use in augmented reality technology. It 
was  predicted  two  years  ago  that  the  number  of  mobile 
phones sold in 2012 will be around 1.8 billion, and 80% of 
them were estimated to be from the smart phone category 
[3].  Unknown marketing strategists introduced the term 
smart  phones  to  refer  to  a  new  category  of  the  mobile 
phones  which  could  allow  data  access  and  processing 
with greater computing power at that time [4]. Generally 
it is said that, augmented reality has become practicable 
on  high-end  mobile  handsets  only  in  2009.    This  was 
because of the availability of superior technology and five 
key  facilities  within  the  handsets  other  than  the  mobile 
operating  system  which  augmented  reality  supports 
which  are;  camera,  GPS,  Broadband  connectivity,  tilt 
sensors and digital compasses [11].  

Normally, most smart phones come with one or more 
built-in cameras, and this allows the device to serve itself 
for  computer  vision  approaches.  Nevertheless,  camera 
and  image  sensor  characteristics  like  frame  size,  update 
rate  etc.  greatly  influences  the  quality  of  computer 
tracking  [12].  Thus,  in  order  to  achieve  the  required 
performance  of  AR  applications,  careful  selection  of 
algorithms is needed. This is because PC’s which acts as a 
high end device have greater computing capabilities than 
the  smart  phones.  For  instance,  heavy  use  of  template 
C++ and Java code ends up in a negative increment in the 
code  size  which  in  turns  slows  down  the  complete 
process  [3].  This  limits  such  devices  to  application  of 
simple  algorithms  to  solve  complex  issues  such  as 
tracking registration and rendering of augmented reality 
contents. 

3  TRACKING 
The  three  main  processes  for  successful  implementation 
of  any  AR  system  are 
tracking,  registration  and 
rendering.  AR  demands  very  precise  position  and 
orientation  tracking  so  that  it  can  register  and  align  the 
virtual  information  with  the  real  elements.  To  cheat  the 
human  sense  in  order  to  accept  that  artificial  virtual 
objects  and  the  physical  objects  co-exist  in  the  same 
physical space, is almost impossible without the accuracy 
and precision achieved by these processes. A number of 
surveys  done  by  Azuma  et  al  [1],  Azuma  et al  [10]  and 
Hollerer [13] describes in detail a number of visual & non-
visual tracking technologies that have been applied to AR 
such as magnetic and ultrasound.  

Generally the latest tracking methods are classified 
based  on  their  accuracy,  resolution,  degrees of  freedom, 
delay,  update  rate,  portability  and  electrical  power 
consumption,  infrastructure  and  operating  range  cost. 
Reference  [14]  explained  that  tiny  devices  like  mobile 
phones  have  attracted  a  lot  of  research  in  the  usage  of 
video cameras as a mean for tracking purposes because of 
the  lower  costs  and  the  advanced  video  capturing 
capabilities of the new video cameras. 

For complex augmented reality applications, a very 
popular approach is the use of fiducials. Fiducial markers 
are patterns which can be identified easily like concentric

2  MOBILE AUGMENTED REALITY 
The  concept  of  AR  technology  can  be  described  as  the 
superimposition of graphics, audios and other objects in 
real-time  over  a  real  world  environment 
[7].  By 
implementing the real world with 3D virtual objects, AR 
technology aims at enhancing the user’s imagination and 
interaction with the real world. The virtual objects seem 
to  co-exist  in  the  same  space  as  the  real  world.  As 
described  by  [5]  successful 
implementation  of  AR 
requires HMD’s and tangible interface objects which has 
the  ability  for  6DOF  pose  tracking.  This is  because  they 
are  capable  of  offering  an  environment  where  the  pose 
tracking is inexpensive and the system works in real time, 
changing  environmental  conditions  and  in  a  robust 
manner.  Many  potential  applications  are  offered  by  AR 
technology 
instant 
information,  gaming,  advertising,  maintenance  and 
construction,  military,  etc.  There  are  hundreds  of 
potential  applications  for  such  a  technology,  the  most 
obvious 
and 
entertainment [8]. 
        In  normal  circumstances  a  pair  of  sunglasses 
combined  with  high-resolution  3D  graphics  capabilities, 
accurate  DOF  tracking  and  built-in  computer  with 
wireless network support is all we need to setup an ideal 
mobile  AR  system.  No  other  equipment  is  required  to 
carry or wear by a mobile user to experience mobile AR 
environment  [9,  10].  The  Columbia  Touring  Machine 
(CTM)  was  introduced  as  the  first  outdoor  mobile 
augmented reality system which included true mobility. 
According  to  [7],  user  must  not  feel  any  conflict  and 
discrepancies  between  the  augmented  environment  and 
the  real  world  when  AR  reaches  nearer  to  its  maturity 
level. It is because of this that the goal of AR technology is 
to create an environment where user cannot differentiate 
the  real  world  and  augmented elements.  Therefore,  it  is 
clear  that  AR  focuses  on  changing  those  graphics  to 
accommodate  the  user’s  head  and  eyes  movements  to 
assure that the graphics always fit the perspective of the 
user.

assure that the graphics always fit the perspective of the

compared to other 2D codes such as PDF417, DataMatrix 
and Maxi Code is much higher [21, 32].  The QR codes are 
extensively used on business cards these days (Fig. 3). By 
placing  the  QR  codes  on  a  business  card,  people  can 
digitally pass on their contact details, direct the viewer to 
a website, send them to a Flickr photo set or Facebook fan 
page etc.  A number of QR code applications are available 
in different mobile platforms and have specially gained a 
lot of popularity after the evolution of android OS.

The  Android  platform  is  composed  of  the  operating 
system,  middleware,  user 
interface  and  application 
software and is the first software platform and operating 
system built for complete mobile devices [18].

circles  located  in  defined  positions.  They  can  be  like  a 
passive printed marker or an active light-emitting diode. 
Both  of  the  two  types  of  markers  have  already  been 
experimented  in  different  AR  applications  in  previous 
researches.  The  clutter  resulting  from  the  markers  is 
sometimes  undesirable  but  the  use  of  black  and-  white 
printed  markers  is  considerably  inexpensive.  It  is  also 
considered faster and quicker than many accurate off-line 
surveying  of  the  open  spaces  and  other  borderless 
markers.  To  efficiently  tag  a  huge  number  of  different 
locations and objects, unique identifiers are encoded into 
the  marker  [12].  Although  there  are  many  existing 
fiducial-based tracking systems available today but none 
can reach the heights of the ARToolkit system. Tamura et 
al [15], Billinghurst et al [11], Wagner et al [2], Cheok et al 
[16],  Barakonyi  et  al  [17]  presents  examples  where  they 
have  implemented  different  versions  of  ARToolkit  in 
mobile  devices.  Moreover,  various  tracking  algorithms 
discussed in [14] also provides realistic real-time camera 
tracking. These techniques follow approaches like natural 
feature detection, edge detection, planar methods etc. The 
disadvantage  of  such  techniques and  approaches is  that 
they  demand  a  huge  amount  of  processing  power 
creating difficulties on other AR tasks such as rendering. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In  simple  AR  terminology,  rendering  refers  to  the 
drawing of  the  contents onto  the  screen  for  the  users  to 
witness.  The  majority  of  the  existing  AR  systems  use 
standard  computer  graphics  algorithms  for  displaying 
virtual  objects  in  an  augmented  reality  environment. 
Popular  software  libraries  such  as  OpenGL,  OpenCV, 
their hybrid versions like OpenGLES and high level scene 
graphs  based  on  them  (e.g.,  OpenSG  PLUS)    are  often 
utilized  for  real-time  rendering  in  AR  [6,18].  The  most 
challenging part for creating 3D models in mobile phones 
is that the devices have limited computational resources.

4  QUICK RESPONSE CODE 
QR  codes  are  two  dimensional  barcodes  which  were 
introduced  by  Denso  Wave  in  Japan.  QR  Codes  gained 
rapid  popularity  and  were  adopted  all  over  the  world, 
especially  in  Japan  because  of  its  ability  to  encode  the 
Kanji  symbols.  They  are  widely  used  in  storing  URLs, 
addresses  and  various  forms  of  data  on  posters,  signs, 
public  transport  vehicles,  and  business  cards.  QR  codes 
have  already  become  more  popular  than  the  classical 
barcode in many places. This is due to the fact that typical 
barcodes only store a maximum of 20 digits; however QR 
Codes can save up to 7,089 characters [19].  

QR  Codes  do  not  need  to  be  scanned  from  one 
particular  angle  which  makes  them  more  flexible.  The 
information  is  stored  in  both  vertical  and  horizontal 
directions.  A  QR  code  can  be  read  even  it  is  somewhat 
distorted by either being tilted or on a curved surface by

Features and Techniques for Advance 

Business Card System Based on Android 

Mobile Augmented Reality 

W. K. Obeidy, H. Arshad, and B. Parhizkar 

Abstract— Due to advancements in the mobile world and the presence of various strong mobile platforms (Android, IOS, 
Symbian), it is now possible to make use of the revolutionizing Augmented Reality (AR) technology in mobile devices. This 
paper presents a short review of concepts of augmented reality and different features and techniques used in previous 
researches in the field of mobile augmented reality such as tracking, rendering of graphics and the visualization of data required 
in order to develop an advance business card system. It was found that few simpler AR and Quick Response (QR) code 
systems exist independently for business cards but do not co-exist together. The core concept of the research is to successfully 
combine the QR code and the AR and to visualize the virtual 2D & 3D information which in turn displays on mobile phone 
screen by using AR technology. This work will present us an opportunity to understand and discuss how systems using these 
advanced technologies can shape today’s business and communication systems.

1  INTRODUCTION

A

 relatively  new  term  in  the  field  of  technology  is 
Augmented Reality (AR) which is somehow can be 
considered as an extension or a variation of virtual 
reality. It lets users to experience a new world where the 
real  world  is  composited  or  superimposed  with  the 
virtual  objects  upon  it  and  therefore  it  acts  so  as  to 
supplement the reality, rather than completely replacing 
it  [1].  AR  requires  Head  Mounted  Displays  (HMD)  and 
tangible  interface  objects  which  has  the  ability  for  Six 
Degree  of  Freedom  (6DOF)  pose  tracking  to  assure  that 
there is inexpensive pose tracking, stability in robust and 
time  varying  environmental  conditions  [2].  However,  in 
recent  times  the  popularity  of  AR  devices  has  switched 
from  the  early  mobile  augmented  reality  systems; 
Backpack  with  HMD’s  to  various  small  and  low  cost 
devices in the form of different smart phones and digital 
tablets(Fig. 1 a-d) [3].

According to [4], a smart phone is a tiny, networked 
computer  in  the  form  of  a  cell  phone  which  usually 
provides 
and  wireless 
communication  capabilities  and  Personal  Information 
Management (PIM) applications. 
Smart  phones  are  developed  for  a  comparatively  larger 
consumer  base  which  is  mobile.  They  are  surprisingly 
robust  and  powerful  although  their  appearance  is  very

fragile.  Almost  all  of  the  smart  phones  today  include  a 

built in camera which automatically serves for computer 
vision  approaches.  In  mobile  devices,  generally  the 
quality of AR is lower than AR in PC platforms because 
the  computer  vision’s  quality  is  based  on  camera  and 
image  sensor  characteristics  [5].  Unlike  the  earlier smart 
phones, these days  smart phones are being used by the 
users as a complete gadget which serves almost all their 
electronic media needs such as playing interactive games, 
checking  emails,  reading  news,  watching  TV,  managing 
and  interacting  with  their  social  online/offline  contacts 
and  vCards  in  ways  other  than  just  calling and  sending 
text messages. 

Business cards are widely used small cards that help 
one  in  giving  great  information  and  impression  to 
strangers  in  perceiving  ones  personality  and  work. 
Typical  business  cards  standard  size  and  measurements 
are unable to allocate greater information than their sizes 
due  to  the  limitation  of  space.  Many  a  times,  the 
information of a business card is unclear and incomplete, 
which creates a lot of confusion in its viewer’s mind [6]. 

With  the  task  in  hand,  this  research  is  to  design  and 
digitize  an  advance  business  card  system  using  mobile 
phone  Quick  Response  (QR)  &  AR  technology  which 
could  combine  both these  technologies  along  with  some 
advanced features such as calling, emailing, networking, 
navigation  etc.  in  order  to  enhance  the  functions  of 
traditional  business 
card  and  visualize  detailed 
information about the person. The objective of this work 
is  to  display  a  large  amount  of  clear  information  by 
understanding and using QR and AR technology and to 
tackle some of the previous research problems such as the 
tracking,  poor  graphics  and  visualization  of  data  in  a 
physical business card.

Recently, the smart phones have gained tremendous 
attention for their use in augmented reality technology. It 
was  predicted  two  years  ago  that  the  number  of  mobile 
phones sold in 2012 will be around 1.8 billion, and 80% of 
them were estimated to be from the smart phone category 
[3].  Unknown marketing strategists introduced the term 
smart  phones  to  refer  to  a  new  category  of  the  mobile 
phones  which  could  allow  data  access  and  processing 
with greater computing power at that time [4]. Generally 
it is said that, augmented reality has become practicable 
on  high-end  mobile  handsets  only  in  2009.    This  was 
because of the availability of superior technology and five 
key  facilities  within  the  handsets  other  than  the  mobile 
operating  system  which  augmented  reality  supports 
which  are;  camera,  GPS,  Broadband  connectivity,  tilt 
sensors and digital compasses [11].  

Normally, most smart phones come with one or more 
built-in cameras, and this allows the device to serve itself 
for  computer  vision  approaches.  Nevertheless,  camera 
and  image  sensor  characteristics  like  frame  size,  update 
rate  etc.  greatly  influences  the  quality  of  computer 
tracking  [12].  Thus,  in  order  to  achieve  the  required 
performance  of  AR  applications,  careful  selection  of 
algorithms is needed. This is because PC’s which acts as a 
high end device have greater computing capabilities than 
the  smart  phones.  For  instance,  heavy  use  of  template 
C++ and Java code ends up in a negative increment in the 
code  size  which  in  turns  slows  down  the  complete 
process  [3].  This  limits  such  devices  to  application  of 
simple  algorithms  to  solve  complex  issues  such  as 
tracking registration and rendering of augmented reality 
contents. 

3  TRACKING 
The  three  main  processes  for  successful  implementation 
of  any  AR  system  are 
tracking,  registration  and 
rendering.  AR  demands  very  precise  position  and 
orientation  tracking  so  that  it  can  register  and  align  the 
virtual  information  with  the  real  elements.  To  cheat  the 
human  sense  in  order  to  accept  that  artificial  virtual 
objects  and  the  physical  objects  co-exist  in  the  same 
physical space, is almost impossible without the accuracy 
and precision achieved by these processes. A number of 
surveys  done  by  Azuma  et  al  [1],  Azuma  et al  [10]  and 
Hollerer [13] describes in detail a number of visual & non-
visual tracking technologies that have been applied to AR 
such as magnetic and ultrasound.  

Generally the latest tracking methods are classified 
based  on  their  accuracy,  resolution,  degrees of  freedom, 
delay,  update  rate,  portability  and  electrical  power 
consumption,  infrastructure  and  operating  range  cost. 
Reference  [14]  explained  that  tiny  devices  like  mobile 
phones  have  attracted  a  lot  of  research  in  the  usage  of 
video cameras as a mean for tracking purposes because of 
the  lower  costs  and  the  advanced  video  capturing 
capabilities of the new video cameras. 

For complex augmented reality applications, a very 
popular approach is the use of fiducials. Fiducial markers 
are patterns which can be identified easily like concentric

2  MOBILE AUGMENTED REALITY 
The  concept  of  AR  technology  can  be  described  as  the 
superimposition of graphics, audios and other objects in 
real-time  over  a  real  world  environment 
[7].  By 
implementing the real world with 3D virtual objects, AR 
technology aims at enhancing the user’s imagination and 
interaction with the real world. The virtual objects seem 
to  co-exist  in  the  same  space  as  the  real  world.  As 
described  by  [5]  successful 
implementation  of  AR 
requires HMD’s and tangible interface objects which has 
the  ability  for  6DOF  pose  tracking.  This is  because  they 
are  capable  of  offering  an  environment  where  the  pose 
tracking is inexpensive and the system works in real time, 
changing  environmental  conditions  and  in  a  robust 
manner.  Many  potential  applications  are  offered  by  AR 
technology 
instant 
information,  gaming,  advertising,  maintenance  and 
construction,  military,  etc.  There  are  hundreds  of 
potential  applications  for  such  a  technology,  the  most 
obvious 
and 
entertainment [8]. 
        In  normal  circumstances  a  pair  of  sunglasses 
combined  with  high-resolution  3D  graphics  capabilities, 
accurate  DOF  tracking  and  built-in  computer  with 
wireless network support is all we need to setup an ideal 
mobile  AR  system.  No  other  equipment  is  required  to 
carry or wear by a mobile user to experience mobile AR 
environment  [9,  10].  The  Columbia  Touring  Machine 
(CTM)  was  introduced  as  the  first  outdoor  mobile 
augmented reality system which included true mobility. 
According  to  [7],  user  must  not  feel  any  conflict  and 
discrepancies  between  the  augmented  environment  and 
the  real  world  when  AR  reaches  nearer  to  its  maturity 
level. It is because of this that the goal of AR technology is 
to create an environment where user cannot differentiate 
the  real  world  and  augmented elements.  Therefore,  it  is 
clear  that  AR  focuses  on  changing  those  graphics  to 
accommodate  the  user’s  head  and  eyes  movements  to 
assure that the graphics always fit the perspective of the 
user.

decode  the  image  based  on  the  three  squares  that  are 
positioned  in  the  corners  of  the  symbol  and  their

[20]. Different areas are reserved inside the QR Code for 
performing different tasks (Fig. 2).

compared to other 2D codes such as PDF417, DataMatrix 
and Maxi Code is much higher [21, 32].  The QR codes are 
extensively used on business cards these days (Fig. 3). By 
placing  the  QR  codes  on  a  business  card,  people  can 
digitally pass on their contact details, direct the viewer to 
a website, send them to a Flickr photo set or Facebook fan 
page etc.  A number of QR code applications are available 
in different mobile platforms and have specially gained a 
lot of popularity after the evolution of android OS. 

5  ANDROID OS 
The  Android  platform  is  composed  of  the  operating 
system,  middleware,  user 
interface  and  application 
software and is the first software platform and operating 
system built for complete mobile devices [18].

Both  of  the  two  types  of  markers  have  already  been

devices,  sensors  and  communication  media. Through its 
massive  complex  of  more  than  100,000  Linux  servers 
Google  revealed  the  power  of  “Open  Source”  in  2008.

technologies  with its open source  Android platform[23]. 
In May 2010, Android's first quarter U.S. sales surpassed 
that of the rival iPhone platform. Analysts pointed many 
advantages and said that Android has as a multi-channel, 
multi-carrier OS, which allowed it to duplicate the quick 
success  of  Microsoft's  Windows  Mobile  and  even  more. 
Several hardware manufacturers have already announced 
Android  enabled  smartphones  and  netbooks,  even 
companies  like  Dell  and  Acer  that  normally  are  known 
for ordinary PC hardware[24]. Fig. 4 shows the latest 2012

with the robustness and flexibility of the platform. 

6  BUSINESS CARDS 
Business  cards  are  one  of  the  important communication 
media  among  people.  They  are  printed  with  business 
information about a company or an individual. A typical 
business  card  includes  the  giver’s  name,  company 
affiliation  and  contact  information  such  as  addresses, 
contact  numbers,  e-mail  addresses  and  etc.  (Fig.  5).  The 
aspect  ratios  range  of  business  cards is  from 1.43  to  1.8. 
This is because different countries have different standard 
for the size of business cards [26,27].

    Augmented  Business  Card  is  a  business  card  that 
comes with marker for AR technology tracking. In simple 
words, this business card is exactly like a typical business 
card with the implementation of AR technology in it. An 
experimental  business  card  recognition  system  was 
proposed by [28] that recognizes Japanese business cards 
of a wide variety both in formats and fonts.  
   In order to use the information effectively, [29] extracted 
the  information  from  the  cards  automatically  to  build  a 
data base. Hua & Liu [30] presented a system which can 
automatically  extract,  rectify  and  enhance  business  card 
images  and  used  extensive  experiments  to  demonstrate 
the  efficacy  and  robustness  of  their  system.  One  more 
example of such research is found in Toxin Labs’ research 
where AR technology is used in business card to display 
status of social networks, show personal portfolio, calling 
or direct contact through the application and etc. [31].  
     Meanwhile,  Wagner  &  Schmalstieg  [2,  12]  have  also 
performed such research where they track a marker on a 
business card with AR technology (Fig. 6). According to 
them the marker is usually expected to be surrounded by 
black borders and containing a black and white pattern or 
image. However, the marker’s border can be made very 
thin  (down  to  zero)  if  the  image  inside  the  marker  is 
darker.  Another  similar  research  done  by  Weng  et.al  [6] 
introduces  the  technology  of  Mobile  Phone  AR  and 
develop  an  application  for  business  card  and  shows  a 
successful rendering of a 3d map of the university upon 
the detection of the marker on the business card.

Abstract— Due to advancements in the mobile world and the presence of various strong mobile platforms (Android, IOS, 
Symbian), it is now possible to make use of the revolutionizing Augmented Reality (AR) technology in mobile devices. This 
paper presents a short review of concepts of augmented reality and different features and techniques used in previous 
researches in the field of mobile augmented reality such as tracking, rendering of graphics and the visualization of data required 
in order to develop an advance business card system. It was found that few simpler AR and Quick Response (QR) code 
systems exist independently for business cards but do not co-exist together. The core concept of the research is to successfully 
combine the QR code and the AR and to visualize the virtual 2D & 3D information which in turn displays on mobile phone 
screen by using AR technology. This work will present us an opportunity to understand and discuss how systems using these 
advanced technologies can shape today’s business and communication systems.

1  INTRODUCTION

A

 relatively  new  term  in  the  field  of  technology  is 
Augmented Reality (AR) which is somehow can be 
considered as an extension or a variation of virtual 
reality. It lets users to experience a new world where the 
real  world  is  composited  or  superimposed  with  the 
virtual  objects  upon  it  and  therefore  it  acts  so  as  to 
supplement the reality, rather than completely replacing 
it  [1].  AR  requires  Head  Mounted  Displays  (HMD)  and 
tangible  interface  objects  which  has  the  ability  for  Six 
Degree  of  Freedom  (6DOF)  pose  tracking  to  assure  that 
there is inexpensive pose tracking, stability in robust and 
time  varying  environmental  conditions  [2].  However,  in 
recent  times  the  popularity  of  AR  devices  has  switched 
from  the  early  mobile  augmented  reality  systems; 
Backpack  with  HMD’s  to  various  small  and  low  cost 
devices in the form of different smart phones and digital 
tablets(Fig. 1 a-d) [3].

According to [4], a smart phone is a tiny, networked 
computer  in  the  form  of  a  cell  phone  which  usually 
provides 
and  wireless 
communication  capabilities  and  Personal  Information 
Management (PIM) applications. 
Smart  phones  are  developed  for  a  comparatively  larger 
consumer  base  which  is  mobile.  They  are  surprisingly 
robust  and  powerful  although  their  appearance  is  very

fragile.  Almost  all  of  the  smart  phones  today  include  a 

built in camera which automatically serves for computer 
vision  approaches.  In  mobile  devices,  generally  the 
quality of AR is lower than AR in PC platforms because 
the  computer  vision’s  quality  is  based  on  camera  and 
image  sensor  characteristics  [5].  Unlike  the  earlier smart 
phones, these days  smart phones are being used by the 
users as a complete gadget which serves almost all their 
electronic media needs such as playing interactive games, 
checking  emails,  reading  news,  watching  TV,  managing 
and  interacting  with  their  social  online/offline  contacts 
and  vCards  in  ways  other  than  just  calling and  sending 
text messages. 

Business cards are widely used small cards that help 
one  in  giving  great  information  and  impression  to 
strangers  in  perceiving  ones  personality  and  work. 
Typical  business  cards  standard  size  and  measurements 
are unable to allocate greater information than their sizes 
due  to  the  limitation  of  space.  Many  a  times,  the 
information of a business card is unclear and incomplete, 
which creates a lot of confusion in its viewer’s mind [6]. 

With  the  task  in  hand,  this  research  is  to  design  and 
digitize  an  advance  business  card  system  using  mobile 
phone  Quick  Response  (QR)  &  AR  technology  which 
could  combine  both these  technologies  along  with  some 
advanced features such as calling, emailing, networking, 
navigation  etc.  in  order  to  enhance  the  functions  of 
traditional  business 
card  and  visualize  detailed 
information about the person. The objective of this work 
is  to  display  a  large  amount  of  clear  information  by 
understanding and using QR and AR technology and to 
tackle some of the previous research problems such as the 
tracking,  poor  graphics  and  visualization  of  data  in  a 
physical business card.

Recently, the smart phones have gained tremendous 
attention for their use in augmented reality technology. It 
was  predicted  two  years  ago  that  the  number  of  mobile 
phones sold in 2012 will be around 1.8 billion, and 80% of 
them were estimated to be from the smart phone category 
[3].  Unknown marketing strategists introduced the term 
smart  phones  to  refer  to  a  new  category  of  the  mobile 
phones  which  could  allow  data  access  and  processing 
with greater computing power at that time [4]. Generally 
it is said that, augmented reality has become practicable 
on  high-end  mobile  handsets  only  in  2009.    This  was 
because of the availability of superior technology and five 
key  facilities  within  the  handsets  other  than  the  mobile 
operating  system  which  augmented  reality  supports 
which  are;  camera,  GPS,  Broadband  connectivity,  tilt 
sensors and digital compasses [11].  

Normally, most smart phones come with one or more 
built-in cameras, and this allows the device to serve itself 
for  computer  vision  approaches.  Nevertheless,  camera 
and  image  sensor  characteristics  like  frame  size,  update 
rate  etc.  greatly  influences  the  quality  of  computer 
tracking  [12].  Thus,  in  order  to  achieve  the  required 
performance  of  AR  applications,  careful  selection  of 
algorithms is needed. This is because PC’s which acts as a 
high end device have greater computing capabilities than 
the  smart  phones.  For  instance,  heavy  use  of  template 
C++ and Java code ends up in a negative increment in the 
code  size  which  in  turns  slows  down  the  complete 
process  [3].  This  limits  such  devices  to  application  of 
simple  algorithms  to  solve  complex  issues  such  as 
tracking registration and rendering of augmented reality 
contents. 

3  TRACKING 
The  three  main  processes  for  successful  implementation 
of  any  AR  system  are 
tracking,  registration  and 
rendering.  AR  demands  very  precise  position  and 
orientation  tracking  so  that  it  can  register  and  align  the 
virtual  information  with  the  real  elements.  To  cheat  the 
human  sense  in  order  to  accept  that  artificial  virtual 
objects  and  the  physical  objects  co-exist  in  the  same 
physical space, is almost impossible without the accuracy 
and precision achieved by these processes. A number of 
surveys  done  by  Azuma  et  al  [1],  Azuma  et al  [10]  and 
Hollerer [13] describes in detail a number of visual & non-
visual tracking technologies that have been applied to AR 
such as magnetic and ultrasound.  

Generally the latest tracking methods are classified 
based  on  their  accuracy,  resolution,  degrees of  freedom, 
delay,  update  rate,  portability  and  electrical  power 
consumption,  infrastructure  and  operating  range  cost. 
Reference  [14]  explained  that  tiny  devices  like  mobile 
phones  have  attracted  a  lot  of  research  in  the  usage  of 
video cameras as a mean for tracking purposes because of 
the  lower  costs  and  the  advanced  video  capturing 
capabilities of the new video cameras. 

For complex augmented reality applications, a very 
popular approach is the use of fiducials. Fiducial markers 
are patterns which can be identified easily like concentric

2  MOBILE AUGMENTED REALITY 
The  concept  of  AR  technology  can  be  described  as  the 
superimposition of graphics, audios and other objects in 
real-time  over  a  real  world  environment 
[7].  By 
implementing the real world with 3D virtual objects, AR 
technology aims at enhancing the user’s imagination and 
interaction with the real world. The virtual objects seem 
to  co-exist  in  the  same  space  as  the  real  world.  As 
described  by  [5]  successful 
implementation  of  AR 
requires HMD’s and tangible interface objects which has 
the  ability  for  6DOF  pose  tracking.  This is  because  they 
are  capable  of  offering  an  environment  where  the  pose 
tracking is inexpensive and the system works in real time, 
changing  environmental  conditions  and  in  a  robust 
manner.  Many  potential  applications  are  offered  by  AR 
technology 
instant 
information,  gaming,  advertising,  maintenance  and 
construction,  military,  etc.  There  are  hundreds  of 
potential  applications  for  such  a  technology,  the  most 
obvious 
and 
entertainment [8]. 
        In  normal  circumstances  a  pair  of  sunglasses 
combined  with  high-resolution  3D  graphics  capabilities, 
accurate  DOF  tracking  and  built-in  computer  with 
wireless network support is all we need to setup an ideal 
mobile  AR  system.  No  other  equipment  is  required  to 
carry or wear by a mobile user to experience mobile AR 
environment  [9,  10].  The  Columbia  Touring  Machine 
(CTM)  was  introduced  as  the  first  outdoor  mobile 
augmented reality system which included true mobility. 
According  to  [7],  user  must  not  feel  any  conflict  and 
discrepancies  between  the  augmented  environment  and 
the  real  world  when  AR  reaches  nearer  to  its  maturity 
level. It is because of this that the goal of AR technology is 
to create an environment where user cannot differentiate 
the  real  world  and  augmented elements.  Therefore,  it  is 
clear  that  AR  focuses  on  changing  those  graphics  to 
accommodate  the  user’s  head  and  eyes  movements  to 
assure that the graphics always fit the perspective of the 
user.

decode  the  image  based  on  the  three  squares  that  are 
positioned  in  the  corners  of  the  symbol  and  their 
alignment  is  determined  by  different  QR  code  scanners 
[20]. Different areas are reserved inside the QR Code for 
performing different tasks (Fig. 2).

    A  QR  code  can  withhold  7,089  numeric  characters, 
4,296  alphanumeric  characters,  2,953  binary  bytes,  1,817 
Kanji characters or a mixture of them. The data capacity 
compared to other 2D codes such as PDF417, DataMatrix 
and Maxi Code is much higher [21, 32].  The QR codes are 
extensively used on business cards these days (Fig. 3). By 
placing  the  QR  codes  on  a  business  card,  people  can 
digitally pass on their contact details, direct the viewer to 
a website, send them to a Flickr photo set or Facebook fan 
page etc.  A number of QR code applications are available 
in different mobile platforms and have specially gained a 
lot of popularity after the evolution of android OS. 

5  ANDROID OS 
The  Android  platform  is  composed  of  the  operating 
system,  middleware,  user 
interface  and  application 
software and is the first software platform and operating 
system built for complete mobile devices [18].

circles  located  in  defined  positions.  They  can  be  like  a 
passive printed marker or an active light-emitting diode. 
Both  of  the  two  types  of  markers  have  already  been 
experimented  in  different  AR  applications  in  previous 
researches.  The  clutter  resulting  from  the  markers  is 
sometimes  undesirable  but  the  use  of  black  and-  white 
printed  markers  is  considerably  inexpensive.  It  is  also 
considered faster and quicker than many accurate off-line 
surveying  of  the  open  spaces  and  other  borderless 
markers.  To  efficiently  tag  a  huge  number  of  different 
locations and objects, unique identifiers are encoded into 
the  marker  [12].  Although  there  are  many  existing 
fiducial-based tracking systems available today but none 
can reach the heights of the ARToolkit system. Tamura et 
al [15], Billinghurst et al [11], Wagner et al [2], Cheok et al 
[16],  Barakonyi  et  al  [17]  presents  examples  where  they 
have  implemented  different  versions  of  ARToolkit  in 
mobile  devices.  Moreover,  various  tracking  algorithms 
discussed in [14] also provides realistic real-time camera 
tracking. These techniques follow approaches like natural 
feature detection, edge detection, planar methods etc. The 
disadvantage  of  such  techniques and  approaches is  that 
they  demand  a  huge  amount  of  processing  power 
creating difficulties on other AR tasks such as rendering. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In  simple  AR  terminology,  rendering  refers  to  the 
drawing of  the  contents onto  the  screen  for  the  users  to 
witness.  The  majority  of  the  existing  AR  systems  use 
standard  computer  graphics  algorithms  for  displaying 
virtual  objects  in  an  augmented  reality  environment. 
Popular  software  libraries  such  as  OpenGL,  OpenCV, 
their hybrid versions like OpenGLES and high level scene 
graphs  based  on  them  (e.g.,  OpenSG  PLUS)    are  often 
utilized  for  real-time  rendering  in  AR  [6,18].  The  most 
challenging part for creating 3D models in mobile phones 
is that the devices have limited computational resources.

4  QUICK RESPONSE CODE 
QR  codes  are  two  dimensional  barcodes  which  were 
introduced  by  Denso  Wave  in  Japan.  QR  Codes  gained 
rapid  popularity  and  were  adopted  all  over  the  world, 
especially  in  Japan  because  of  its  ability  to  encode  the 
Kanji  symbols.  They  are  widely  used  in  storing  URLs, 
addresses  and  various  forms  of  data  on  posters,  signs, 
public  transport  vehicles,  and  business  cards.  QR  codes 
have  already  become  more  popular  than  the  classical 
barcode in many places. This is due to the fact that typical 
barcodes only store a maximum of 20 digits; however QR 
Codes can save up to 7,089 characters [19].  

QR  Codes  do  not  need  to  be  scanned  from  one 
particular  angle  which  makes  them  more  flexible.  The 
information  is  stored  in  both  vertical  and  horizontal 
directions.  A  QR  code  can  be  read  even  it  is  somewhat 
distorted by either being tilted or on a curved surface by

In May 2010, Android's first quarter U.S. sales surpassed 
that of the rival iPhone platform. Analysts pointed many 
advantages and said that Android has as a multi-channel, 
multi-carrier OS, which allowed it to duplicate the quick 
success  of  Microsoft's  Windows  Mobile  and  even  more. 
Several hardware manufacturers have already announced 
Android  enabled  smartphones  and  netbooks,  even

for ordinary PC hardware[24]. Fig. 4 shows the latest 2012

6  BUSINESS CARDS 
Business  cards  are  one  of  the  important communication 
media  among  people.  They  are  printed  with  business 
information about a company or an individual. A typical 
business  card  includes  the  giver’s  name,  company 
affiliation  and  contact  information  such  as  addresses, 
contact  numbers,  e-mail  addresses  and  etc.  (Fig.  5).  The 
aspect  ratios  range  of  business  cards is  from 1.43  to  1.8. 
This is because different countries have different standard 
for the size of business cards [26,27].

    Augmented  Business  Card  is  a  business  card  that 
comes with marker for AR technology tracking. In simple 
words, this business card is exactly like a typical business 
card with the implementation of AR technology in it. An 
experimental  business  card  recognition  system  was 
proposed by [28] that recognizes Japanese business cards 
of a wide variety both in formats and fonts.  
   In order to use the information effectively, [29] extracted 
the  information  from  the  cards  automatically  to  build  a 
data base. Hua & Liu [30] presented a system which can 
automatically  extract,  rectify  and  enhance  business  card 
images  and  used  extensive  experiments  to  demonstrate 
the  efficacy  and  robustness  of  their  system.  One  more 
example of such research is found in Toxin Labs’ research 
where AR technology is used in business card to display 
status of social networks, show personal portfolio, calling 
or direct contact through the application and etc. [31].  
     Meanwhile,  Wagner  &  Schmalstieg  [2,  12]  have  also 
performed such research where they track a marker on a 
business card with AR technology (Fig. 6). According to 
them the marker is usually expected to be surrounded by 
black borders and containing a black and white pattern or 
image. However, the marker’s border can be made very 
thin  (down  to  zero)  if  the  image  inside  the  marker  is 
darker.  Another  similar  research  done  by  Weng  et.al  [6] 
introduces  the  technology  of  Mobile  Phone  AR  and 
develop  an  application  for  business  card  and  shows  a 
successful rendering of a 3d map of the university upon 
the detection of the marker on the business card.

7  PROPOSED WORK 
The proposed work section will give a brief description of 
the  methodologies  that  will  be  implemented  to  develop 
the Advance Business Card System. After our review, we 
realized that along with the fundamental problems in the 
areas  of  tracking,  registration  and  rendering  of  AR 
materials which are normally dealt with the help of image 
processing  and  computer  vision  techniques,  the  lack  of 
processing  power  of  the  handheld  devices  and  growing 
need of the implementation of new technologies to cater 
the needs of the business contacts also required solutions. 
Due  to  the  lower  capabilities  of  the  smart  phones  as 
compared  to  the  computers,  algorithms  and  techniques 
will  be  chosen  very  carefully  in  order  to  successfully 
combine  the  QR  code,  augmented  reality  (tracking, 
registration  and  rendering)  and  visualisation  techniques 
in  order  to  come  up  with  an  advance  more  visual, 
interactive and exciting business system. The 6DOF pose 
tracking of devices would prove as an inexpensive pose 
tracking,  workable 
time  changing 
environmental  conditions.  Fiducial  markers  developed 
using  the  ARToolkit  will  provide  realistic  real-time 
camera  tracking  stability  and  robustness. This is  to  ease 
the rendering process of complex models and 3D objects.  
Different  approaches  such  as  natural  feature  detection, 
edge detection, planar methods etc. will also be tested in 
order  to  analyze  the  differences in  the  performance  and 
efficiency of the system. This will require large amounts 
of processing power posing difficulties on the additional 
AR rendering tasks. OpenGLES will be used extensively 
for  the  development  of  3D  Models  to  assist  successful 
rendering  of  complex  models  on  the  Android  OS. 
However  different  techniques  other  than  the  OpenGL 
development  will  also  be  conducted  for  the  analysis 
purposes only.  A special  attention  will  be  focused  upon 
the  relativity  of  the  information  and  the  amount  of  the 
data augmented in the form of visuals by understanding 
the  different  concepts  of  visualization  and  combining  it 
with the main concepts of the research, namely; QR code, 
and 
Augmented  Reality 
Business  Card. 
Shneiderman’s  Visual 
Information  Seeking  Mantra 
provides  design  guidelines  for  dynamic  exploration  of 
large information collections. This mantra will be used as 
a  starting  point  in  the  understanding  of  how  to  design 
effective  visualizations  after  the  comparative  review  of 
typical techniques used in the marker development.

8  CONCLUSION 

A literature review of the topics such as QR technology, 
mobile  augmented  reality,  business  cards  and  the  latest 

platforms  have  enabled  us  to  understand  the  basic 
concepts  of  these  technologies  and  provided  us  with  a 
deep  analysis  of  the  research  work  going  on  in  these 
areas. During the course of the literature search we found 
some  major  problems  which exist  in these  fields.  It  was 
clearly  identified  that  even  though  there  exist  some 
systems which either supports the AR or QR technologies 
in  the  business  cards,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  have  a 
system  which  could  combine  both  these  technologies 
along  with  some  advanced  features  such  as  calling, 
emailing,  networking,  navigation  etc.  We  have  named 
this system as an Advance Business Card System.

Features and Techniques for Advance 

Business Card System Based on Android 

Mobile Augmented Reality 

W. K. Obeidy, H. Arshad, and B. Parhizkar 

Abstract— Due to advancements in the mobile world and the presence of various strong mobile platforms (Android, IOS, 
Symbian), it is now possible to make use of the revolutionizing Augmented Reality (AR) technology in mobile devices. This 
paper presents a short review of concepts of augmented reality and different features and techniques used in previous 
researches in the field of mobile augmented reality such as tracking, rendering of graphics and the visualization of data required 
in order to develop an advance business card system. It was found that few simpler AR and Quick Response (QR) code 
systems exist independently for business cards but do not co-exist together. The core concept of the research is to successfully 
combine the QR code and the AR and to visualize the virtual 2D & 3D information which in turn displays on mobile phone 
screen by using AR technology. This work will present us an opportunity to understand and discuss how systems using these 
advanced technologies can shape today’s business and communication systems.

1  INTRODUCTION

A

 relatively  new  term  in  the  field  of  technology  is 
Augmented Reality (AR) which is somehow can be 
considered as an extension or a variation of virtual 
reality. It lets users to experience a new world where the 
real  world  is  composited  or  superimposed  with  the 
virtual  objects  upon  it  and  therefore  it  acts  so  as  to 
supplement the reality, rather than completely replacing 
it  [1].  AR  requires  Head  Mounted  Displays  (HMD)  and 
tangible  interface  objects  which  has  the  ability  for  Six 
Degree  of  Freedom  (6DOF)  pose  tracking  to  assure  that 
there is inexpensive pose tracking, stability in robust and 
time  varying  environmental  conditions  [2].  However,  in 
recent  times  the  popularity  of  AR  devices  has  switched 
from  the  early  mobile  augmented  reality  systems; 
Backpack  with  HMD’s  to  various  small  and  low  cost 
devices in the form of different smart phones and digital 
tablets(Fig. 1 a-d) [3].

According to [4], a smart phone is a tiny, networked 
computer  in  the  form  of  a  cell  phone  which  usually 
provides 
and  wireless 
communication  capabilities  and  Personal  Information 
Management (PIM) applications. 
Smart  phones  are  developed  for  a  comparatively  larger 
consumer  base  which  is  mobile.  They  are  surprisingly 
robust  and  powerful  although  their  appearance  is  very

fragile.  Almost  all  of  the  smart  phones  today  include  a 

built in camera which automatically serves for computer 
vision  approaches.  In  mobile  devices,  generally  the 
quality of AR is lower than AR in PC platforms because 
the  computer  vision’s  quality  is  based  on  camera  and 
image  sensor  characteristics  [5].  Unlike  the  earlier smart 
phones, these days  smart phones are being used by the 
users as a complete gadget which serves almost all their 
electronic media needs such as playing interactive games, 
checking  emails,  reading  news,  watching  TV,  managing 
and  interacting  with  their  social  online/offline  contacts 
and  vCards  in  ways  other  than  just  calling and  sending 
text messages. 

Business cards are widely used small cards that help 
one  in  giving  great  information  and  impression  to 
strangers  in  perceiving  ones  personality  and  work. 
Typical  business  cards  standard  size  and  measurements 
are unable to allocate greater information than their sizes 
due  to  the  limitation  of  space.  Many  a  times,  the 
information of a business card is unclear and incomplete, 
which creates a lot of confusion in its viewer’s mind [6]. 

With  the  task  in  hand,  this  research  is  to  design  and 
digitize  an  advance  business  card  system  using  mobile 
phone  Quick  Response  (QR)  &  AR  technology  which 
could  combine  both these  technologies  along  with  some 
advanced features such as calling, emailing, networking, 
navigation  etc.  in  order  to  enhance  the  functions  of 
traditional  business 
card  and  visualize  detailed 
information about the person. The objective of this work 
is  to  display  a  large  amount  of  clear  information  by 
understanding and using QR and AR technology and to 
tackle some of the previous research problems such as the 
tracking,  poor  graphics  and  visualization  of  data  in  a 
physical business card.

Recently, the smart phones have gained tremendous 
attention for their use in augmented reality technology. It 
was  predicted  two  years  ago  that  the  number  of  mobile 
phones sold in 2012 will be around 1.8 billion, and 80% of 
them were estimated to be from the smart phone category 
[3].  Unknown marketing strategists introduced the term 
smart  phones  to  refer  to  a  new  category  of  the  mobile 
phones  which  could  allow  data  access  and  processing 
with greater computing power at that time [4]. Generally 
it is said that, augmented reality has become practicable 
on  high-end  mobile  handsets  only  in  2009.    This  was 
because of the availability of superior technology and five 
key  facilities  within  the  handsets  other  than  the  mobile 
operating  system  which  augmented  reality  supports 
which  are;  camera,  GPS,  Broadband  connectivity,  tilt 
sensors and digital compasses [11].  

Normally, most smart phones come with one or more 
built-in cameras, and this allows the device to serve itself 
for  computer  vision  approaches.  Nevertheless,  camera 
and  image  sensor  characteristics  like  frame  size,  update 
rate  etc.  greatly  influences  the  quality  of  computer 
tracking  [12].  Thus,  in  order  to  achieve  the  required 
performance  of  AR  applications,  careful  selection  of 
algorithms is needed. This is because PC’s which acts as a 
high end device have greater computing capabilities than 
the  smart  phones.  For  instance,  heavy  use  of  template 
C++ and Java code ends up in a negative increment in the 
code  size  which  in  turns  slows  down  the  complete 
process  [3].  This  limits  such  devices  to  application  of 
simple  algorithms  to  solve  complex  issues  such  as 
tracking registration and rendering of augmented reality 
contents. 

3  TRACKING 
The  three  main  processes  for  successful  implementation 
of  any  AR  system  are 
tracking,  registration  and 
rendering.  AR  demands  very  precise  position  and 
orientation  tracking  so  that  it  can  register  and  align  the 
virtual  information  with  the  real  elements.  To  cheat  the 
human  sense  in  order  to  accept  that  artificial  virtual 
objects  and  the  physical  objects  co-exist  in  the  same 
physical space, is almost impossible without the accuracy 
and precision achieved by these processes. A number of 
surveys  done  by  Azuma  et  al  [1],  Azuma  et al  [10]  and 
Hollerer [13] describes in detail a number of visual & non-
visual tracking technologies that have been applied to AR 
such as magnetic and ultrasound.  

Generally the latest tracking methods are classified 
based  on  their  accuracy,  resolution,  degrees of  freedom, 
delay,  update  rate,  portability  and  electrical  power 
consumption,  infrastructure  and  operating  range  cost. 
Reference  [14]  explained  that  tiny  devices  like  mobile 
phones  have  attracted  a  lot  of  research  in  the  usage  of 
video cameras as a mean for tracking purposes because of 
the  lower  costs  and  the  advanced  video  capturing 
capabilities of the new video cameras. 

For complex augmented reality applications, a very 
popular approach is the use of fiducials. Fiducial markers 
are patterns which can be identified easily like concentric

2  MOBILE AUGMENTED REALITY 
The  concept  of  AR  technology  can  be  described  as  the 
superimposition of graphics, audios and other objects in 
real-time  over  a  real  world  environment 
[7].  By 
implementing the real world with 3D virtual objects, AR 
technology aims at enhancing the user’s imagination and 
interaction with the real world. The virtual objects seem 
to  co-exist  in  the  same  space  as  the  real  world.  As 
described  by  [5]  successful 
implementation  of  AR 
requires HMD’s and tangible interface objects which has 
the  ability  for  6DOF  pose  tracking.  This is  because  they 
are  capable  of  offering  an  environment  where  the  pose 
tracking is inexpensive and the system works in real time, 
changing  environmental  conditions  and  in  a  robust 
manner.  Many  potential  applications  are  offered  by  AR 
technology 
instant 
information,  gaming,  advertising,  maintenance  and 
construction,  military,  etc.  There  are  hundreds  of 
potential  applications  for  such  a  technology,  the  most 
obvious 
and 
entertainment [8]. 
        In  normal  circumstances  a  pair  of  sunglasses 
combined  with  high-resolution  3D  graphics  capabilities, 
accurate  DOF  tracking  and  built-in  computer  with 
wireless network support is all we need to setup an ideal 
mobile  AR  system.  No  other  equipment  is  required  to 
carry or wear by a mobile user to experience mobile AR 
environment  [9,  10].  The  Columbia  Touring  Machine 
(CTM)  was  introduced  as  the  first  outdoor  mobile 
augmented reality system which included true mobility. 
According  to  [7],  user  must  not  feel  any  conflict  and 
discrepancies  between  the  augmented  environment  and 
the  real  world  when  AR  reaches  nearer  to  its  maturity 
level. It is because of this that the goal of AR technology is 
to create an environment where user cannot differentiate 
the  real  world  and  augmented elements.  Therefore,  it  is 
clear  that  AR  focuses  on  changing  those  graphics  to 
accommodate  the  user’s  head  and  eyes  movements  to 
assure that the graphics always fit the perspective of the 
user.

decode  the  image  based  on  the  three  squares  that  are 
positioned  in  the  corners  of  the  symbol  and  their 
alignment  is  determined  by  different  QR  code  scanners 
[20]. Different areas are reserved inside the QR Code for 
performing different tasks (Fig. 2).

4,296  alphanumeric  characters,  2,953  binary  bytes,  1,817 
Kanji characters or a mixture of them. The data capacity 
compared to other 2D codes such as PDF417, DataMatrix 
and Maxi Code is much higher [21, 32].  The QR codes are 
extensively used on business cards these days (Fig. 3). By 
placing  the  QR  codes  on  a  business  card,  people  can 
digitally pass on their contact details, direct the viewer to 
a website, send them to a Flickr photo set or Facebook fan 
page etc.  A number of QR code applications are available 
in different mobile platforms and have specially gained a 
lot of popularity after the evolution of android OS. 

5  ANDROID OS 
The  Android  platform  is  composed  of  the  operating 
system,  middleware,  user 
interface  and  application 
software and is the first software platform and operating 
system built for complete mobile devices [18].

circles  located  in  defined  positions.  They  can  be  like  a 
passive printed marker or an active light-emitting diode. 
Both  of  the  two  types  of  markers  have  already  been 
experimented  in  different  AR  applications  in  previous 
researches.  The  clutter  resulting  from  the  markers  is 
sometimes  undesirable  but  the  use  of  black  and-  white 
printed  markers  is  considerably  inexpensive.  It  is  also 
considered faster and quicker than many accurate off-line 
surveying  of  the  open  spaces  and  other  borderless 
markers.  To  efficiently  tag  a  huge  number  of  different 
locations and objects, unique identifiers are encoded into 
the  marker  [12].  Although  there  are  many  existing 
fiducial-based tracking systems available today but none 
can reach the heights of the ARToolkit system. Tamura et 
al [15], Billinghurst et al [11], Wagner et al [2], Cheok et al 
[16],  Barakonyi  et  al  [17]  presents  examples  where  they 
have  implemented  different  versions  of  ARToolkit  in 
mobile  devices.  Moreover,  various  tracking  algorithms 
discussed in [14] also provides realistic real-time camera 
tracking. These techniques follow approaches like natural 
feature detection, edge detection, planar methods etc. The 
disadvantage  of  such  techniques and  approaches is  that 
they  demand  a  huge  amount  of  processing  power 
creating difficulties on other AR tasks such as rendering. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In  simple  AR  terminology,  rendering  refers  to  the 
drawing of  the  contents onto  the  screen  for  the  users  to 
witness.  The  majority  of  the  existing  AR  systems  use 
standard  computer  graphics  algorithms  for  displaying 
virtual  objects  in  an  augmented  reality  environment. 
Popular  software  libraries  such  as  OpenGL,  OpenCV, 
their hybrid versions like OpenGLES and high level scene 
graphs  based  on  them  (e.g.,  OpenSG  PLUS)    are  often 
utilized  for  real-time  rendering  in  AR  [6,18].  The  most 
challenging part for creating 3D models in mobile phones 
is that the devices have limited computational resources.

4  QUICK RESPONSE CODE 
QR  codes  are  two  dimensional  barcodes  which  were 
introduced  by  Denso  Wave  in  Japan.  QR  Codes  gained 
rapid  popularity  and  were  adopted  all  over  the  world, 
especially  in  Japan  because  of  its  ability  to  encode  the 
Kanji  symbols.  They  are  widely  used  in  storing  URLs, 
addresses  and  various  forms  of  data  on  posters,  signs, 
public  transport  vehicles,  and  business  cards.  QR  codes 
have  already  become  more  popular  than  the  classical 
barcode in many places. This is due to the fact that typical 
barcodes only store a maximum of 20 digits; however QR 
Codes can save up to 7,089 characters [19].  

QR  Codes  do  not  need  to  be  scanned  from  one 
particular  angle  which  makes  them  more  flexible.  The 
information  is  stored  in  both  vertical  and  horizontal 
directions.  A  QR  code  can  be  read  even  it  is  somewhat 
distorted by either being tilted or on a curved surface by

In May 2010, Android's first quarter U.S. sales surpassed 
that of the rival iPhone platform. Analysts pointed many 
advantages and said that Android has as a multi-channel, 
multi-carrier OS, which allowed it to duplicate the quick 
success  of  Microsoft's  Windows  Mobile  and  even  more. 
Several hardware manufacturers have already announced 
Android  enabled  smartphones  and  netbooks,  even

for ordinary PC hardware[24]. Fig. 4 shows the latest 2012

6  BUSINESS CARDS 
Business  cards  are  one  of  the  important communication 
media  among  people.  They  are  printed  with  business 
information about a company or an individual. A typical 
business  card  includes  the  giver’s  name,  company 
affiliation  and  contact  information  such  as  addresses, 
contact  numbers,  e-mail  addresses  and  etc.  (Fig.  5).  The 
aspect  ratios  range  of  business  cards is  from 1.43  to  1.8. 
This is because different countries have different standard 
for the size of business cards [26,27].

    Augmented  Business  Card  is  a  business  card  that 
comes with marker for AR technology tracking. In simple 
words, this business card is exactly like a typical business 
card with the implementation of AR technology in it. An 
experimental  business  card  recognition  system  was 
proposed by [28] that recognizes Japanese business cards 
of a wide variety both in formats and fonts.  
   In order to use the information effectively, [29] extracted 
the  information  from  the  cards  automatically  to  build  a 
data base. Hua & Liu [30] presented a system which can 
automatically  extract,  rectify  and  enhance  business  card 
images  and  used  extensive  experiments  to  demonstrate 
the  efficacy  and  robustness  of  their  system.  One  more 
example of such research is found in Toxin Labs’ research 
where AR technology is used in business card to display 
status of social networks, show personal portfolio, calling 
or direct contact through the application and etc. [31].  
     Meanwhile,  Wagner  &  Schmalstieg  [2,  12]  have  also 
performed such research where they track a marker on a 
business card with AR technology (Fig. 6). According to 
them the marker is usually expected to be surrounded by 
black borders and containing a black and white pattern or 
image. However, the marker’s border can be made very 
thin  (down  to  zero)  if  the  image  inside  the  marker  is 
darker.  Another  similar  research  done  by  Weng  et.al  [6] 
introduces  the  technology  of  Mobile  Phone  AR  and 
develop  an  application  for  business  card  and  shows  a 
successful rendering of a 3d map of the university upon 
the detection of the marker on the business card.

7  PROPOSED WORK 
The proposed work section will give a brief description of 
the  methodologies  that  will  be  implemented  to  develop 
the Advance Business Card System. After our review, we 
realized that along with the fundamental problems in the 
areas  of  tracking,  registration  and  rendering  of  AR 
materials which are normally dealt with the help of image 
processing  and  computer  vision  techniques,  the  lack  of 
processing  power  of  the  handheld  devices  and  growing 
need of the implementation of new technologies to cater 
the needs of the business contacts also required solutions. 
Due  to  the  lower  capabilities  of  the  smart  phones  as 
compared  to  the  computers,  algorithms  and  techniques 
will  be  chosen  very  carefully  in  order  to  successfully 
combine  the  QR  code,  augmented  reality  (tracking, 
registration  and  rendering)  and  visualisation  techniques 
in  order  to  come  up  with  an  advance  more  visual, 
interactive and exciting business system. The 6DOF pose 
tracking of devices would prove as an inexpensive pose 
tracking,  workable 
time  changing 
environmental  conditions.  Fiducial  markers  developed 
using  the  ARToolkit  will  provide  realistic  real-time 
camera  tracking  stability  and  robustness. This is  to  ease 
the rendering process of complex models and 3D objects.  
Different  approaches  such  as  natural  feature  detection, 
edge detection, planar methods etc. will also be tested in 
order  to  analyze  the  differences in  the  performance  and 
efficiency of the system. This will require large amounts 
of processing power posing difficulties on the additional 
AR rendering tasks. OpenGLES will be used extensively 
for  the  development  of  3D  Models  to  assist  successful 
rendering  of  complex  models  on  the  Android  OS. 
However  different  techniques  other  than  the  OpenGL 
development  will  also  be  conducted  for  the  analysis 
purposes only.  A special  attention  will  be  focused  upon 
the  relativity  of  the  information  and  the  amount  of  the 
data augmented in the form of visuals by understanding 
the  different  concepts  of  visualization  and  combining  it 
with the main concepts of the research, namely; QR code, 
and 
Augmented  Reality 
Business  Card. 
Shneiderman’s  Visual 
Information  Seeking  Mantra 
provides  design  guidelines  for  dynamic  exploration  of 
large information collections. This mantra will be used as 
a  starting  point  in  the  understanding  of  how  to  design 
effective  visualizations  after  the  comparative  review  of 
typical techniques used in the marker development.

8  CONCLUSION 

A literature review of the topics such as QR technology, 
mobile  augmented  reality,  business  cards  and  the  latest 

platforms  have  enabled  us  to  understand  the  basic 
concepts  of  these  technologies  and  provided  us  with  a 
deep  analysis  of  the  research  work  going  on  in  these 
areas. During the course of the literature search we found 
some  major  problems  which exist  in these  fields.  It  was 
clearly  identified  that  even  though  there  exist  some 
systems which either supports the AR or QR technologies 
in  the  business  cards,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  have  a 
system  which  could  combine  both  these  technologies 
along  with  some  advanced  features  such  as  calling, 
emailing,  networking,  navigation  etc.  We  have  named
