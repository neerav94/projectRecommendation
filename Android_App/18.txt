Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for

and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7).

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future? 
3.2.1 

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day

In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et

gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different

relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform?

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence

3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the

The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis.

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence

3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

Individual influence in terms of app development platform 

Table 3. 
 
Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence 

Table 1. 
 
3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Environmental influence considers the context in which an individual is placed and how the individual 
responds to that environment. Data was analysed from the following questions. Do you think you can 
make a decent living out of the development of mobile applications? Do you live in a rural, urban or 
peri-urban area? Are there any obstacles making it difficult to publish your mobile apps? Is there a 
market demand for local mobile apps? Do you think that a mobile apps development hub/factory can 
be established in a rural area? Are you generating any income from your mobile applications? 
3.3.1  Attitudes about app development 

This question targeted the attitudes about whether a career path in app development is worthwhile. The 
data from this question was differentiated from an individual influence because it forms an attitude 
based  on  external  rather  than  personal  interest.  Table  10  shows  that  both  men  (84.4%)  and  women 
(75%) believe that app development can provide a decent living.

This  question  assessed  where  the  app  developers  live.  A  peri-urban  area  in  South  Africa  is  more 
commonly known as a township. In a South African context, a township carries with it a connotation 
of the segregated history. All the participants answered this question. Table 11 shows that the majority 
of app developers live in townships; 85.7% of men and 66.7% of the women.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence

3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

3.3 

Environmental influence considers the context in which an individual is placed and how the individual 
responds to that environment. Data was analysed from the following questions. Do you think you can 
make a decent living out of the development of mobile applications? Do you live in a rural, urban or 
peri-urban area? Are there any obstacles making it difficult to publish your mobile apps? Is there a

be established in a rural area? Are you generating any income from your mobile applications? 
3.3.1  Attitudes about app development 

This question targeted the attitudes about whether a career path in app development is worthwhile. The 
data from this question was differentiated from an individual influence because it forms an attitude 
based  on  external  rather  than  personal  interest.  Table  10  shows  that  both  men  (84.4%)  and  women 
(75%) believe that app development can provide a decent living.

3.3.2  Demography 

 

This  question  assessed  where  the  app  developers  live.  A  peri-urban  area  in  South  Africa  is  more 
commonly known as a township. In a South African context, a township carries with it a connotation 
of the segregated history. All the participants answered this question. Table 11 shows that the majority 
of app developers live in townships; 85.7% of men and 66.7% of the women.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence

3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Educational background 

The majority of women, 88.9%, had University degrees and post-University degrees compared with 
the men 54.2% (Table 2).

Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Environmental influence 

Table 9. 
 
3.3 

Environmental influence considers the context in which an individual is placed and how the individual 
responds to that environment. Data was analysed from the following questions. Do you think you can 
make a decent living out of the development of mobile applications? Do you live in a rural, urban or 
peri-urban area? Are there any obstacles making it difficult to publish your mobile apps? Is there a 
market demand for local mobile apps? Do you think that a mobile apps development hub/factory can 
be established in a rural area? Are you generating any income from your mobile applications? 
3.3.1  Attitudes about app development 

This question targeted the attitudes about whether a career path in app development is worthwhile. The 
data from this question was differentiated from an individual influence because it forms an attitude 
based  on  external  rather  than  personal  interest.  Table  10  shows  that  both  men  (84.4%)  and  women 
(75%) believe that app development can provide a decent living.

This  question  assessed  where  the  app  developers  live.  A  peri-urban  area  in  South  Africa  is  more 
commonly known as a township. In a South African context, a township carries with it a connotation 
of the segregated history. All the participants answered this question. Table 11 shows that the majority 
of app developers live in townships; 85.7% of men and 66.7% of the women.

Conclusions 

The  paper  set  out  to  understand  the  relationship between  gender  and  choice  in  app  development  in 
South Africa. Mobile phones are a growing phenomenon in South Africa (and Africa), and are slated 
to pass the 100% mark over the next few years. It is therefore important to understand and increase the 
participation  of  women  in  app  development.  The  paper  in  drawing  from  the  individual  differences 
theory  of  gender  and  ICT  confirmed  how  the  underrepresentation  of  women  in  app  development 
continues, as it does in ICT (Alexander et al., 2011). The findings nonetheless suggest that there is as 
good an interest among women as men regarding app development, and that app development is not 
essentialist – it is neither inherently male nor female oriented. The suggestion points to question how 
the app development environment in South Africa may unknowingly be fostering patriarchy. 
4.1 

Focus on collaboration and education for women 

The  findings  also  conjecture  that  women  who  develop  apps  have  a  graduate  and  postgraduate 
education  and  prefer  to  work  in  collaboration  with  other  app  developers  rather  than  alone.  The 
proposition points to how women are responding to app development environments in South Africa by 
preferring  a  collaborative  work  environment.  The  finding  may  also  indicate  how  women  may 
inadvertently be making a choice between femininity and professionalism (Wajcman, 2010).

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence

3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Individual influence from a career path perspective 

 

Environmental influence 

Table 9. 
 
3.3 

Environmental influence considers the context in which an individual is placed and how the individual 
responds to that environment. Data was analysed from the following questions. Do you think you can 
make a decent living out of the development of mobile applications? Do you live in a rural, urban or 
peri-urban area? Are there any obstacles making it difficult to publish your mobile apps? Is there a 
market demand for local mobile apps? Do you think that a mobile apps development hub/factory can 
be established in a rural area? Are you generating any income from your mobile applications? 
3.3.1  Attitudes about app development 

This question targeted the attitudes about whether a career path in app development is worthwhile. The 
data from this question was differentiated from an individual influence because it forms an attitude 
based  on  external  rather  than  personal  interest.  Table  10  shows  that  both  men  (84.4%)  and  women 
(75%) believe that app development can provide a decent living.

3.3.2  Demography 

 

This  question  assessed  where  the  app  developers  live.  A  peri-urban  area  in  South  Africa  is  more 
commonly known as a township. In a South African context, a township carries with it a connotation 
of the segregated history. All the participants answered this question. Table 11 shows that the majority 
of app developers live in townships; 85.7% of men and 66.7% of the women.

Conclusions 

The  paper  set  out  to  understand  the  relationship between  gender  and  choice  in  app  development  in 
South Africa. Mobile phones are a growing phenomenon in South Africa (and Africa), and are slated 
to pass the 100% mark over the next few years. It is therefore important to understand and increase the 
participation  of  women  in  app  development.  The  paper  in  drawing  from  the  individual  differences 
theory  of  gender  and  ICT  confirmed  how  the  underrepresentation  of  women  in  app  development 
continues, as it does in ICT (Alexander et al., 2011). The findings nonetheless suggest that there is as 
good an interest among women as men regarding app development, and that app development is not 
essentialist – it is neither inherently male nor female oriented. The suggestion points to question how 
the app development environment in South Africa may unknowingly be fostering patriarchy. 
4.1 

Focus on collaboration and education for women 

The  findings  also  conjecture  that  women  who  develop  apps  have  a  graduate  and  postgraduate 
education  and  prefer  to  work  in  collaboration  with  other  app  developers  rather  than  alone.  The 
proposition points to how women are responding to app development environments in South Africa by 
preferring  a  collaborative  work  environment.  The  finding  may  also  indicate  how  women  may 
inadvertently be making a choice between femininity and professionalism (Wajcman, 2010).

4.2 

Android gaining ground 

Android in its open platform policy appears to be the app platform of choice even for the women. The 
preference  for  Android  signals  a  shift  in  the  South  African  app  market  towards  Android  from  the 
dominant Blackberry 7 user market base. 
4.3  Women are equally interested 

Both  men  and  women  believe  that  there  is  a  market  demand  for  app  developers  and  that  app 
development can be financially rewarding as a career path. In fact, women are similarly generating 
income from app development. Nonetheless, women are generally developing on less platforms. The 
research suggests that women may tend to get deeper in one app platform rather than have knowledge 
of multiple platforms. We make this assumption because different from women, men identified some 
obstacles  to  app  development  while  the  women  did  not.  We  also  note  that  the  interest  in  men  and 
women leads both groups to self-train in app development. This shows that the intrinsic motivation of 
app developers is as high in women as in men. The ability to self-train rather than wait for a course is 
well related to the perception that app development as a possible career. 
4.4 

App development and city life 

The majority of the app developers in South Africa live in peri-urban areas but are not convinced that 
app development centres are worth creating in rural areas. South Africa is a developmental state which 
means government has an interest on increasing capacity in rural areas by setting up app centres for 
training and collaboration. It is clear app developers associate app development with the cities. 
4.5 

Contribution to theory and practice 

The  three  constructs  of  the  individual  differences  theory  provided  an  appropriate  framework  to 
understand  women  underrepresentation  in  South  Africa.  However,  the  essentialist  dimension  of  the 
theory  did  not  stand  up  successfully  to  scrutiny  because  of  the  lower  number  of  women  who 
participated in the study. The individual difference theory was derived from an American context. This 
research therefore did not find a sufficient fit of the individual differences theory in Africa as well, 
particularly in South Africa. The conclusions show that efforts to support more women to become app 
developers are worthwhile but need to be more collaborative in the way the training and mentorship is 
done.  The  research  shows  that  women  are  more  likely  to  remain  interested  if  there  are  more 
collaborative opportunities.

Abstract 

The underrepresentation of women in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a 
challenge  despite  the  existing  conducive  opportunity  for  a  career  in  ICT.  In  this  digital  era  where 
smartphones  are  almost  synonymous  with  urban  living,  this  paper  sought  to  explore  the  social 
sustainability  of  gender  diversity  as  a  degree  of  involvement  of  women  in  technically  developing 
mobile apps (apps). App development is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to 
remain as such for the foreseeable future.  The research drew on the individual differences theory of 
gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore the extent to which the underrepresentation 
has  similarly  permeated  app  development.  The  findings  from  the  exploratory  study  of  44  app 
developers  in  South  Africa  suggest  that  gender  underrepresentation  and  bias  has  spread  to  app 
development.  The  results  nonetheless  reveal  a  similar  degree  of  interest  among  women  as  men  to 
attempt  a  career  in  app  development,  but  more  especially,  that  women  have  a  preference  for 
collaborative app development environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts 
and interventions to change female perceptions about app development and to stem the ever widening 
technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also 
lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a 
result  of  essentialist  differences  between  men  and  women  but  more  a  result  of  social  and  cultural 
habits.

Introduction 
ICT  today  has  changed  to  such  an  extent  that  creating  a  webpage  or  mobile  app  is  as  simple  as 
dragging  and  dropping  the  interface  elements.  The  simplicity  in  use  of  ICT  means  that  men  and 
women have an equal career opportunity in ICT. There is nonetheless an existing stereotypical mind-
set about women’s ability to succeed in an ICT career (Hayes, 2014). For example, a career in ICT is 
still  perceived  as  “men’s  work”  (Trauth,  2006).  The  general  perception  that  ICT  specialists  are 
unsociable males with a great interest in ICT clashes with the stereotypical roles assigned to women 
(Jepson & Perl, 2002). It is however surprising to discover that women underrepresentation in ICT has 
not  always  been  that  way.  Abbate  (2012)  in  her  book  illustrates  using  the  history  of  women  in 
technology,  how  women  dominated  programming  in  the  early  days  of  computing.  It  is  surprising 
because the current perception is that women are at times regarded as only half-skilled in technology 
oriented careers (Wilson, 2004).  
The  perception  has  an  impact  on  the  mind-set  such  that  women  feel  that  they  are  technically 
incompetent.  Women  also  feel  that  they  do  not  want  to  sit  in  front  of  a  boring  terminals  all  day 
excluding  socialisation  in  their  lives,  and  feel  incompetent  to  get  a  job  due  to  ICT  being  a  male-
dominated sector (Durndell, 1991). Males however appear to enjoy computer-related challenges and 
subconsciously accept the field of computers as a male-dominated field (Whitley, 1997). For example, 
Si (2010) identified that males categorise the task of “web design” and “write a simple program” as 
masculine,  and  that  the  task  of  “write  a  simple  program”  became  more  complex  and  harder  for 
females to complete. Canada and Brusca (1991) labelled women’s negative attitude towards ICT as 
the “technological gender gap”. 
In this paper, we drew on the individual differences theory of gender and ICT (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al.,  2004)  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  choice  of  mobile  app  development  platform  and 
gender, with a particular focus on the choices that women are taking. The theory places emphasis on 
differences  within  gender  rather  than  on  the  differences  between  gender  using  three  constructs;  the 
individual’s personal identity, the personal influences on the individual in making a decision to work 
in ICT, and the environmental influences on the individual such as culture and economic factors. The 
theory  was  developed  and  has  been  applied  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  understand  how  to 
make sense of the underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector.  
Mobile apps are a piece of software that runs on a mobile device. There are different apps for different 
types of mobile devices. From a functional perspective, mobile apps are designed to help improve an 
individual’s well-being, the lifestyle and to assist in making important decisions. App users make a 
choice of app based on factors such as attractiveness, value, usability and safety (Chang, Kaasinen, & 
Kaipainen, 2012). App developers create apps with executable source code which has multiple lines of 
code (Wasserman, 2010). App developers have the choice of developing native apps which run on the 
mobile device (native apps), apps that run from a web browser on the mobile device, or a hybrid of 
native apps that draw their content from the internet (web apps). The choice of development tools and 
frameworks is dependent on the app platform and the app developer.  
The  research  postulated  that  women  choose  a  particular  app  development  platform  to  reduce  the 
difficulty  they  might  experience  at  a  later  stage  during  the  app  development  process  (Clayton,  von 
Hellens, & Nielsen, 2009). We therefore sought to find answers to the research question: What is the 
relationship between gender and choice of mobile app developer platform? 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section explores the literature on the 
individual differences theory and mobile apps, from which sub research questions were extracted. It is 
followed by the research approach which explains the choice of research approach. The analysis and 
findings section discusses the main findings of the research. The final section presents the conclusions, 
and the paper contributions and limitations.

Literature review 

1.1  App development 

App  development  is  a  growing  phenomenon  across  all  sectors  of  society.  The  five  most  common 
mobile  development  platforms  are  Android,  Blackberry,  Windows  phone,  iPhone  and  Symbian 
(Oliver, 2009). App developers have to decide which platform they feel most comfortable with. It is 
not only the demand for apps that stirs developers into developing for a specific mobile platform, but 
also the characteristics and requirements of each platform (Gavalas & Economou, 2011) 
There  are  three  technical  aspects  that  influence  developers  when  choosing  a  platform;  the  software 
development kit (SDK), the app store and the degree of integration. The SDK includes an emulator for 
the  mobile  device,  a  library  for  the  development  language  as  well  as  debuggers  to  remove  coding 
errors.  Some  SDK’s  such  as  the  iPhone  SDK  have  a  number  of  restrictions.  An  app  store  is  the 
publication portal. Some portals allow developers to publish their apps on their stores without review 
such as Google’s Play while others such as Apple’s App Store review every app before it is published 
(Butler,  2011).  The  degree  of  integration  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  an  app  is  bundled  with  the 
device  at  manufacturing  or  is  placed  on  the  portal  for  later  download  by  the  device.  The  research 
therefore sought to investigate two sub-research questions to explore the relationship between gender 
and app development as follows: 
SR1: There is a relationship between gender and app developer platform chosen  
SR2: There is a relationship between gender and the number of app developer platforms chosen 
1.2  Women and ICT 

Although a great deal has changed in recent times to encourage female participation in technical ICT 
careers, there are still a number of influences from a young age that affect women’s confidence with 
regards technical ICT fields. Some of these include negative utterances by people in authority such as 
teachers  and  parents  about  women  and  ICT.  Such  socio-familial  influences  and  the  accompanying 
responsibilities of women affect their confidence (Wajcman, 2010). It also creates a glass ceiling about 
their  capabilities  in  ICT  (Clayton  et  al.,  2009;  Trauth  et  al.,  2004).  At  the  work  place,  the  under-
representation, lower income and fewer promotions of women in the ICT sector compared to men also 
reinforce the negative perceptions about women in ICT (Sumner & Niederman, 2002) 
There are a number of successful initiatives and bursaries by international bodies, governments, civil 
society,  education  and  industry  to  encourage  women  to  join  the  ICT  sector  (James,  Smith,  Roodt, 
Primo,  &  Evans,  2006).  For  example,  Innovaspire  in  South  Africa  encourages  women  to  become 
technologically  inclined  entrepreneurs  by  creating  apps.  The  girls  involved  in  the  programme  were 
surprised  by  the  apps  they  were  able  to  build  in  a  short  time  as  shown  in  this  parent’s  quote:  “my 
daughter never thought she could do anything technical; now she knows she can” (Butler, 2011, p. 7). 
In the next section, we present a theory that brings together ideas on women and ICT. 
1.3 

The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and ICT 

The individual differences theory draws from the essentialist and social construction perspectives of 
gender to explain the causes of female underrepresentation in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2006; Trauth et 
al., 2004). The underlying ontology of essentialism is that every natural specie is different based on a 
unique set of attributes, which attributes enable that specie to function in that capacity (Ellis, 2001). 
The  proponents  of  the  essentialism  view  gender  underrepresentation  as  a  result  of  the  inherently

Twinomurinzi et al. /Gender and app development in South Africa 

unique  and  different  biological  and  psychological  attributes  between  men  and  women.  Essentialists 
argue  that  women  respond  differently from  men  to ICT.  The  essentialist  strategies  to  deal  with  the 
underrepresentation of women therefore focus on creating “separate but equal” environments which 
suit women in the ICT sector (Trauth, 2004). The thesis of social constructionism is that human beings 
make sense of the world in which they live through interaction and communication with others (Pinch 
&  Bijker,  1987;  Wajcman,  2010).  The  proponents  of  social  constructionism  therefore  attribute  the 
underrepresentation of women in the ICT sector to the sector being socially constructed to suit men 
and not women. The social constructivist strategies therefore focus on assisting women to adapt in a 
male-dominated  sector  and  to  re-shape  the  ICT  sector  to  be  more  accommodative  of  women.  The 
argument  of  a  social  constructivist  is  that  ICT  is  gender-neutral  but  male  dominated,  and  that  the 
results of ICT are influenced by such male domination (Wajcman, 2010). The main criticism of the 
essentialist perspective is that the view masks the reality that women once dominated the ICT field at 
the beginning of the computing field, a position which has changed over time (Abbate, 2012). 
The  individual  differences  theory  takes  a  middle  ground  between  the  essentialist  and  the  social 
constructivist  views.  The  theory  considers  the  ICT  sector  as  socially  constructed  to  suit  men,  and 
identifies  how  women  individually  respond  to  the  'socially-constructed-for-men'  ICT  environment. 
The  theory  has  three  constructs:  individual  identity,  individual  influences  and  environmental 
influences. 
Individual  identity  draws  from  the  essentialist  domain  to  describe  the  inherent  features  of  an 
individual. The demographic category shows an individual’s memberships in particular groups within 
the population such as age, race or ethnicity. The professional items relate to the type of work and 
industry in which the individual is. Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter 
and  remain  in  the  ICT  field.  It  is  a  mixture  of  an  individual's  personal  characteristics  and  life 
experiences. Personal characteristics include educational background, personality traits, interests and 
abilities, inclination to ICT work and gender identity. Personal influence represents other people and 
the  ICT  experiences  which  have  influenced  the  individual  into  working  in  the  ICT  profession.  The 
factors  include  early  experiences  with  ICT,  role  models,  mentors  and  significant  life  experiences. 
Environmental  influence  provides  the  context  within  which  the  individual's  response  to  an 
environment is situated. These are cultural attitudes and values about ICT, the contextual information 
about the particular geographic region in which the individual lives, and the economic conditions of 
the  individual.  The  research  therefore  sought  to  investigate  the  following  three  secondary  research 
questions: 
RQ1: There is a relationship between individual identity and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 2: There is a relationship between individual influence and the involvement of women in app 
development. 
RQ 3: There is a relationship between environmental influence and the involvement of women in 
app development. 
In the next section we describe how the research investigated the hypotheses.

Research approach and data collection 

The  research  adopted  an  exploratory  design  in  the  qualitative  research  approach  as  the  context  of 
research  sought  to  be  understood  (Bhattacherjee,  2012).  The  data  used  in  the  research  was  made 
available from the iKamva e-Skills institute (iKeSI) of the Department of Communications in South 
Africa. The data was collected using the survey methodology using online questionnaires posted on a 
website over a 3 month period between July – September 2012. The survey was distributed by email, 
social media, phone, and advertised on national media to app development companies, other e-Skills

hubs  and  to  as  many  app  developer  communities  as  were  known  in  South  Africa.  The  incentive 
devices of three BlackBerry® Playbooks® were sponsored by Research in Motion® South Africa, the 
holding company of BlackBerry®.  
The  questionnaire  had  37  main  questions  which  sought  to  collect  data  about  the  local  relevance  of 
apps, demographics of app developers, demographics of app users, demographics of app development 
training institutes, app demand, fostering innovation in apps, understanding the eco-system in terms of 
the environment, inhibitors to app development and stimulants to app development. 
44 mobile app developers responded with 35 being men and 9 women. Although the population size 
was  sufficient  to  understand  whether  a  relationship  exists  between  gender  and  app  development 
platform, the number of women who responded was not sufficient. The app developers were informed 
that their responses remain confidential and anonymous. The data was analysed using exploratory data 
analysis. 
2.1 

Research context and background 

iKeSI signed a memoradum of understanding (MOU) with one of the large Universities in South to 
coordinate efforts in the Gauteng province towards e-skilling. E-skilling is defined as the ability for an 
individual to make use of any digital platform to do whatever is needed to be done (NeSPA, 2010). In 
the context of South Africa, seven e-Skills were identified (Twinomurinzi, 2012): e-Literacy Skills: 
the  simple  or  intermediate  use  of  ICT  such  as  word  processing.  e-Participation  and  e-Democracy 
Skills: for participation of citizens in governance. e-Government/Governance  Skills: to improve the 
use  of  ICT  within  government.  e-Business  Skills:  for  business  productivity.  e-User  Skills:  the 
application of ICT knowledge by the individual. e-Practitioner Skills: for technical ICT competences. 
e-Community Skills: for social interaction at community level. The iKeSI agenda measures the impact 
of  e-skilling  on  employment  readiness,  effective  e-governance  and  service  delivery,  business 
development,  socio-economic  development,  and  research  and  development.  From  an  eKeSI 
perspective, this research aimed to understand the employment readiness of e-practitioners, women in 
app development.

Analysis and discussion of findings 

Because of the exploratory nature of the research, exploratory data analysis was used to understand the 
relationship  between  gender  and  choice  of  app  developer  platform.  The  limitations  imposed  by 
retrospectively collected data and low number of women respondents meant that only the following 
factors from the individual difference theory could be assessed: Individual identity (gender and age), 
individual influence (educational background, collaboration, experience with app development), and 
environmental influence (attitudes about app development, demography and income).  
3.1 

Individual identity 

The individual identity construct draws mainly from the essentialist domain.  
3.1.1 

Participation 

35 men (79.5%) and 9 women (20.5%) responded in the three months of the survey. Two of those nine 
women  answered  that  they  did  not  voluntarily  complete  the  survey.  The  results  correspond  with 
Canada  and  Brusca’s  (1991)  suggestion  of  the  “technological  gender  gap”  and  confirm  the 
underrepresentation of women in app development.

3.1.2  Age 

In terms of age (Table 1), the most active female app developers (66.6% of females) were in the age 
range of 23-27 and 33-40 (Tables 2 and 3). The active male respondents were spread between the age 
ranges of 23-27, 28-32, 33-40, 41-50. Overall however, the most active age range of app developers 
reflects the women’s most active age group, 23-27 and 33-40.

Individual influence 

Table 1. 
 
3.2 

Individual influence refers to the influence on the decision to enter and remain in the ICT field. The 
analysis drew from the following questions: What is your highest education level? On which mobile 
platforms do you develop applications?  How  long  have  you  been  developing  mobile  applications? 
How  did  you  learn  to  develop  mobile  applications?  Are  you  working  (in  collaboration)  with  other 
mobile developers? Would you be interested in (collaborating) participating in a "jam session" where 
you are partnered with developers, users, designers, managers as a team to develop, test and put to 
market a mobile app within a short period of time? Is mobile applications development a career path 
for your future?

Individual influence in terms of app development platform 

Table 3. 
 
Table 4 show that 47.2% of all app developers only develop on one platform, this means that 52.8% of 
all app developers have skills to develop on more than one platform. 43.8% for the men and 75% for 
the women develop on one platform. It also reveals that more men are willing to develop in more than 
one app platform in comparison to women.

Tables 6 and 7 show that the 4 women who answered the question do not collaborate with other app 
developers. On the other hand 46.4% men collaborate with other app developers. Nonetheless, all the 
women who responded have an interest in collaborating in a jam session where they work with other 
developers and non-developers. It indicates to a degree how women app developers prefer working in 
collaboration as compared to men, 60%.

Individual influence from a career path perspective 

 

Environmental influence 

Table 9. 
 
3.3 

Environmental influence considers the context in which an individual is placed and how the individual 
responds to that environment. Data was analysed from the following questions. Do you think you can 
make a decent living out of the development of mobile applications? Do you live in a rural, urban or 
peri-urban area? Are there any obstacles making it difficult to publish your mobile apps? Is there a 
market demand for local mobile apps? Do you think that a mobile apps development hub/factory can 
be established in a rural area? Are you generating any income from your mobile applications? 
3.3.1  Attitudes about app development 

This question targeted the attitudes about whether a career path in app development is worthwhile. The 
data from this question was differentiated from an individual influence because it forms an attitude 
based  on  external  rather  than  personal  interest.  Table  10  shows  that  both  men  (84.4%)  and  women 
(75%) believe that app development can provide a decent living.

3.3.2  Demography 

 

This  question  assessed  where  the  app  developers  live.  A  peri-urban  area  in  South  Africa  is  more 
commonly known as a township. In a South African context, a township carries with it a connotation 
of the segregated history. All the participants answered this question. Table 11 shows that the majority 
of app developers live in townships; 85.7% of men and 66.7% of the women.

Conclusions 

The  paper  set  out  to  understand  the  relationship between  gender  and  choice  in  app  development  in 
South Africa. Mobile phones are a growing phenomenon in South Africa (and Africa), and are slated 
to pass the 100% mark over the next few years. It is therefore important to understand and increase the 
participation  of  women  in  app  development.  The  paper  in  drawing  from  the  individual  differences 
theory  of  gender  and  ICT  confirmed  how  the  underrepresentation  of  women  in  app  development 
continues, as it does in ICT (Alexander et al., 2011). The findings nonetheless suggest that there is as 
good an interest among women as men regarding app development, and that app development is not 
essentialist – it is neither inherently male nor female oriented. The suggestion points to question how 
the app development environment in South Africa may unknowingly be fostering patriarchy. 
4.1 

Focus on collaboration and education for women 

The  findings  also  conjecture  that  women  who  develop  apps  have  a  graduate  and  postgraduate 
education  and  prefer  to  work  in  collaboration  with  other  app  developers  rather  than  alone.  The 
proposition points to how women are responding to app development environments in South Africa by 
preferring  a  collaborative  work  environment.  The  finding  may  also  indicate  how  women  may 
inadvertently be making a choice between femininity and professionalism (Wajcman, 2010).

Android gaining ground 

Android in its open platform policy appears to be the app platform of choice even for the women. The 
preference  for  Android  signals  a  shift  in  the  South  African  app  market  towards  Android  from  the 
dominant Blackberry 7 user market base. 
4.3  Women are equally interested 

Both  men  and  women  believe  that  there  is  a  market  demand  for  app  developers  and  that  app 
development can be financially rewarding as a career path. In fact, women are similarly generating 
income from app development. Nonetheless, women are generally developing on less platforms. The 
research suggests that women may tend to get deeper in one app platform rather than have knowledge 
of multiple platforms. We make this assumption because different from women, men identified some 
obstacles  to  app  development  while  the  women  did  not.  We  also  note  that  the  interest  in  men  and 
women leads both groups to self-train in app development. This shows that the intrinsic motivation of 
app developers is as high in women as in men. The ability to self-train rather than wait for a course is 
well related to the perception that app development as a possible career. 
4.4 

App development and city life 

The majority of the app developers in South Africa live in peri-urban areas but are not convinced that 
app development centres are worth creating in rural areas. South Africa is a developmental state which 
means government has an interest on increasing capacity in rural areas by setting up app centres for 
training and collaboration. It is clear app developers associate app development with the cities. 
4.5 

Contribution to theory and practice 

The  three  constructs  of  the  individual  differences  theory  provided  an  appropriate  framework  to 
understand  women  underrepresentation  in  South  Africa.  However,  the  essentialist  dimension  of  the 
theory  did  not  stand  up  successfully  to  scrutiny  because  of  the  lower  number  of  women  who 
participated in the study. The individual difference theory was derived from an American context. This 
research therefore did not find a sufficient fit of the individual differences theory in Africa as well, 
particularly in South Africa. The conclusions show that efforts to support more women to become app 
developers are worthwhile but need to be more collaborative in the way the training and mentorship is 
done.  The  research  shows  that  women  are  more  likely  to  remain  interested  if  there  are  more 
collaborative opportunities.
