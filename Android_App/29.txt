1.1      Android Introduction   

Android  system  can  be  divided  into  four  level  structure  modes.  From  down  to  top, 
they are Linux Kernel, Libraries and Android Runtime, Application Framework and 
Application. In Android system, Linux Kernel works as the bridge between hardware 
and  software  and  provides  system  service  based  on  Linux  2.6[1].  For  example: 
security, process management, drive mode, network stack, memory management and 
so on [2]. As the support of application framework, Libraries and Android Runtime 
provide Android core library, virtual computer and lot of function library. Application 
Framework provides a capacious stage  for Android development  members and it is 
composed of 9 functional parts which have the respective special service functions for 
development  members’  convenient  work  [3].  The  development  efficiency  will  be 
improved  by  using  API  framework  and  sharing  the  functional  modules  of 
applications.  The  top  level  of  Android  is  application  level  and  it’s  the  window  to 
contact  with  customers.  Besides  the  application  provided  by  system,  the  third 
application can be also installed. 

The soul of Android Application is its groupware and any Android application is 
composed  of  one  or  more  groupware  between  which  the  information  will  be 
transferred  by  Intent  [4].  Several  important  groupware  in  Android  system  are: 
Activity, Service, Broadcast Receiver and Content Provider.

AHP [5] (Analytical Hierarchy Process) is a kind of assistant decision-making method 
and  it  combines  qualitative  and  quantitative  methods  to  deal  with  a  lot  of  practical 
problems.  Its  main  idea:  analyzing  deeply  to  the  relationship  among  these  factors 
which should take some effect to the target, set up a layer structure, build judgment 
matrix  for  every  layer  according  to  some  rules,  count  the  weight  for  every  factor 
relative to the rule, count final comprehensive weight for every factor relative to the 
target, and the maximum value is optimal decision [6].

System 

2.1      Analysis of AHP 

AHP is an applied kind of assistance decision-making method which can be used in 
all areas of our lives. Now let’s analyse that what functions of AHP module should 
have via taking an example of our life. Example: We don’t know which is better when 
we want to buy something of which there are two kinds, A and B. The problem can be 
solved by AHP in this situation. According to the introduction of the second part of 
the article, first, AHP module should be set up. We can put the best merchandise as 
the target layer, and Norm layer can be determined by the merchandise’s functions, 
price and other conditions (other characters of the merchandise). Decision layer are A 
and B merchandises. As Figure 2.1.

In  order  to  get  the  best  solution,  Weights  of  every  indicator  of  Norm  layer  for 
target and Decision layer for Norm layer must be got. Besides, Accordance proving 
value CR also should be got to test the rationality of the set-up judgment matrix. At 
last, weights of Decision layer should be ranked in all hierarchies. So, AHP module 
includes four main functional modules which are Norm Layer Weight, CR, Decision 
Layer Weight and Final Sort. As Figure 2.2.
