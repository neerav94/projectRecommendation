Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our

and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in

footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010).

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this

permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.

desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects.

involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users.

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.

put it behind them.

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Though intimidated by the task, the boys were willing to attempt a solution. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: They adopted the expression “Let’s hit the boards” as a common signal to share 
work.  

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.  

 

Fig 3: Screenshot of the ‘Home’ screen

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users. 

 

Fig 5: Screenshot of the ‘My Graphs’ page of the application  

 

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.  

 

Fig 6: Screenshot of the ‘Settings’ page 

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens. 

 

Fig 7: Screenshot of an early storyboard model 

 

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype. 

Fig 8: Screenshot of the functioning prototype 

 

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements.

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Figure 2: They adopted the expression “Let’s hit the boards” as a common signal to share 
work.  

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users.

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens.

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype.

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements.

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Figure 2: They adopted the expression “Let’s hit the boards” as a common signal to share 
work.  

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.  

 

Fig 3: Screenshot of the ‘Home’ screen 

Fig 4: Screenshot of the ‘Draw F(x)’ screen  

 

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users. 

 

Fig 5: Screenshot of the ‘My Graphs’ page of the application  

 

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.  

 

Fig 6: Screenshot of the ‘Settings’ page 

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens. 

 

Fig 7: Screenshot of an early storyboard model 

 

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype. 

Fig 8: Screenshot of the functioning prototype 

 

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements. 

Fig 9: Screenshot of later attempt 

 

The final code, part of which is shown below, is to my knowledge, the first of its kind to 
allow a user to draw a function and have the device instantly draw the graph of the 
derivative. 

 

Fig 10: The final code 

Post-Action Problem Solving 

The same outside faculty member spent time in the classroom during the post-action 
problem set. His observations had little to do with the Math involved and focused largely 
on the social dynamic and features of the process. He noted, “It’s really interesting to see 

their reactions to having completed a problem. They’re almost disappointed, maybe not 
disappointed, but they sound like they each want something different in their process.”  

As this problem set was the last of the semester, and knowing that it was part of a 
research project on creativity, they decided to hand in their work in clever ways. The 
boys devised a scavenger hunt for the instructor to follow. Each of the 16 solutions was 
hidden in some fashion, and an individual clue was given to the teacher/researcher to 
follow. Some were encrypted using Number Theory and others were hidden in the 
classroom. The boys sent videos, made on their iPads, as clues and/or demonstrations of 
solutions. Perhaps the most clever was an encryption, that, when decoded, became a local 
phone number. When dialed, the instructor was connected to a voicemail message with a 
personal greeting and solution. Relevant to the action research question or not, it appears 
that merely emphasizing creativity in a math course can inspire students to think in new 
and innovative ways. 

While the grade for both the pre-action and post-action problem sets was intended for use 
in analyzing data, both marks were perfect scores. 

Post-Action Survey 

Four major themes emerged from the post-action survey and discussion. All four boys 
felt less sure about the idea that each person has an innate level of creativity. The 
responses were largely focused on the process of solving problems rather than on the 
results. The fact that the boys were talking about the process of building an iPad 
application instead of the actual product indicates a potential shift towards a growth 
mindset cycle, one boy noting,  “People are often not creative because they think 
themselves not creative and therefore do not try to be. However, creativity is something 
you can become better and better at as you conscientiously attempt to come up with 
different ways of solving a problem.” All four boys responded that they felt empowered 
by the creativity they experienced during the action step. Lastly, each of the boys 
identified that the mistakes they made during and after the action step were more valuable 
learning experiences than the mistakes they made during the pre-action project.

math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Figure 2: They adopted the expression “Let’s hit the boards” as a common signal to share 
work.  

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users. 

 

Fig 5: Screenshot of the ‘My Graphs’ page of the application  

 

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.  

 

Fig 6: Screenshot of the ‘Settings’ page 

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens. 

 

Fig 7: Screenshot of an early storyboard model 

 

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype. 

Fig 8: Screenshot of the functioning prototype 

 

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements. 

Fig 9: Screenshot of later attempt 

 

The final code, part of which is shown below, is to my knowledge, the first of its kind to 
allow a user to draw a function and have the device instantly draw the graph of the 
derivative. 

 

Fig 10: The final code 

Post-Action Problem Solving 

The same outside faculty member spent time in the classroom during the post-action 
problem set. His observations had little to do with the Math involved and focused largely 
on the social dynamic and features of the process. He noted, “It’s really interesting to see 

their reactions to having completed a problem. They’re almost disappointed, maybe not 
disappointed, but they sound like they each want something different in their process.”  

As this problem set was the last of the semester, and knowing that it was part of a 
research project on creativity, they decided to hand in their work in clever ways. The 
boys devised a scavenger hunt for the instructor to follow. Each of the 16 solutions was 
hidden in some fashion, and an individual clue was given to the teacher/researcher to 
follow. Some were encrypted using Number Theory and others were hidden in the 
classroom. The boys sent videos, made on their iPads, as clues and/or demonstrations of 
solutions. Perhaps the most clever was an encryption, that, when decoded, became a local 
phone number. When dialed, the instructor was connected to a voicemail message with a 
personal greeting and solution. Relevant to the action research question or not, it appears 
that merely emphasizing creativity in a math course can inspire students to think in new 
and innovative ways. 

While the grade for both the pre-action and post-action problem sets was intended for use 
in analyzing data, both marks were perfect scores. 

Post-Action Survey 

Four major themes emerged from the post-action survey and discussion. All four boys 
felt less sure about the idea that each person has an innate level of creativity. The 
responses were largely focused on the process of solving problems rather than on the 
results. The fact that the boys were talking about the process of building an iPad 
application instead of the actual product indicates a potential shift towards a growth 
mindset cycle, one boy noting,  “People are often not creative because they think 
themselves not creative and therefore do not try to be. However, creativity is something 
you can become better and better at as you conscientiously attempt to come up with 
different ways of solving a problem.” All four boys responded that they felt empowered 
by the creativity they experienced during the action step. Lastly, each of the boys 
identified that the mistakes they made during and after the action step were more valuable 
learning experiences than the mistakes they made during the pre-action project. 

Post-action problem-solving collaboration 

Many of the same behaviors first seen during the iPad project continued into the post-
action problem set. Students much preferred “hitting the boards” while working in class, 
and creating iPad videos to share ideas and work done at home. While boys still shared 
their individual work with their peers, the group members rarely adopted the work 
shared. Instead, the boys watched and listened to each other, but returned to their own 
workspace and tried to make their solution unique.  

Focus Group Results 

The boys viewed the action project as a different kind of problem solving, simply 
because they knew “the answer didn’t exist, [they] were responsible for creating it.” 

One boy brought up the idea that he let himself “marinate longer in the unknown” during 
this project compared to others. The other three quickly jumped in and echoed the 
sentiment. “I’d never felt so ok not knowing something,” one boy contributed, “I think I’ll 
be more ok not knowing stuff from now on, as long as I eventually figure it out.”  

Then the conversation turned, without prompting, back to creativity. One boy 
remembered writing in his pre-action survey that creativity happens when you let your 
mind wander (“Creativity is hard to practice, because it comes from the lack of focus on 
any specific idea”), but wanted to revise his statement. “That time of not knowing the 
answer, that’s when I felt bursts of creativity. I guess, now that I’m thinking about it, it’s 
not lack of focus, but maybe a lack of a defined path. It’s like getting lost in the woods. 
First you look for a path, when you don’t find one, you eventually need to get creative 
and make your own.” 

When asked about their ability to contribute to the programming problem-solving 
process, the three non-programmers were elated to share their thoughts. The boys 
commented that they never would have thought it possible to help troubleshoot code, 
without ever knowing how to program. One boy noted, “I just never thought about it that 
way. When Trent told us about the pixel problem, we were able to come up with the ideas 
to solve it, and he was able to turn our ideas into code. I was psyched!”

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.

perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users.

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens.

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype. 

Fig 8: Screenshot of the functioning prototype 

 

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements. 

Fig 9: Screenshot of later attempt 

 

The final code, part of which is shown below, is to my knowledge, the first of its kind to 
allow a user to draw a function and have the device instantly draw the graph of the 
derivative.

Post-Action Problem Solving 

The same outside faculty member spent time in the classroom during the post-action 
problem set. His observations had little to do with the Math involved and focused largely 
on the social dynamic and features of the process. He noted, “It’s really interesting to see 

their reactions to having completed a problem. They’re almost disappointed, maybe not 
disappointed, but they sound like they each want something different in their process.”  

As this problem set was the last of the semester, and knowing that it was part of a 
research project on creativity, they decided to hand in their work in clever ways. The 
boys devised a scavenger hunt for the instructor to follow. Each of the 16 solutions was 
hidden in some fashion, and an individual clue was given to the teacher/researcher to 
follow. Some were encrypted using Number Theory and others were hidden in the 
classroom. The boys sent videos, made on their iPads, as clues and/or demonstrations of 
solutions. Perhaps the most clever was an encryption, that, when decoded, became a local 
phone number. When dialed, the instructor was connected to a voicemail message with a 
personal greeting and solution. Relevant to the action research question or not, it appears 
that merely emphasizing creativity in a math course can inspire students to think in new 
and innovative ways. 

While the grade for both the pre-action and post-action problem sets was intended for use 
in analyzing data, both marks were perfect scores. 

Post-Action Survey 

Four major themes emerged from the post-action survey and discussion. All four boys 
felt less sure about the idea that each person has an innate level of creativity. The 
responses were largely focused on the process of solving problems rather than on the 
results. The fact that the boys were talking about the process of building an iPad 
application instead of the actual product indicates a potential shift towards a growth 
mindset cycle, one boy noting,  “People are often not creative because they think 
themselves not creative and therefore do not try to be. However, creativity is something 
you can become better and better at as you conscientiously attempt to come up with 
different ways of solving a problem.” All four boys responded that they felt empowered 
by the creativity they experienced during the action step. Lastly, each of the boys 
identified that the mistakes they made during and after the action step were more valuable 
learning experiences than the mistakes they made during the pre-action project. 

Post-action problem-solving collaboration 

Many of the same behaviors first seen during the iPad project continued into the post-
action problem set. Students much preferred “hitting the boards” while working in class, 
and creating iPad videos to share ideas and work done at home. While boys still shared 
their individual work with their peers, the group members rarely adopted the work 
shared. Instead, the boys watched and listened to each other, but returned to their own 
workspace and tried to make their solution unique.  

Focus Group Results 

The boys viewed the action project as a different kind of problem solving, simply 
because they knew “the answer didn’t exist, [they] were responsible for creating it.” 

One boy brought up the idea that he let himself “marinate longer in the unknown” during 
this project compared to others. The other three quickly jumped in and echoed the 
sentiment. “I’d never felt so ok not knowing something,” one boy contributed, “I think I’ll 
be more ok not knowing stuff from now on, as long as I eventually figure it out.”  

Then the conversation turned, without prompting, back to creativity. One boy 
remembered writing in his pre-action survey that creativity happens when you let your 
mind wander (“Creativity is hard to practice, because it comes from the lack of focus on 
any specific idea”), but wanted to revise his statement. “That time of not knowing the 
answer, that’s when I felt bursts of creativity. I guess, now that I’m thinking about it, it’s 
not lack of focus, but maybe a lack of a defined path. It’s like getting lost in the woods. 
First you look for a path, when you don’t find one, you eventually need to get creative 
and make your own.” 

When asked about their ability to contribute to the programming problem-solving 
process, the three non-programmers were elated to share their thoughts. The boys 
commented that they never would have thought it possible to help troubleshoot code, 
without ever knowing how to program. One boy noted, “I just never thought about it that 
way. When Trent told us about the pixel problem, we were able to come up with the ideas 
to solve it, and he was able to turn our ideas into code. I was psyched!”  

 

 

Conclusion 

In terms of the action research question posed, “How can the use of iPads and application 
development software encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity?” the 
results reflect that it is possible for students to move along the mindset continuum 
towards growth with regard to creativity. Framing the exercise in the context of a creative 
endeavor appeared to play a meaningful role in the students’ experiences. The action 
project gave the boys a break from the conventional “faster is better” mentality that many 
boys employ, allowing them the time and space to “marinate,” create, and design in new 
ways. While a number of the same behaviors carried over from the pre- and post-action 
problem sets, the action project certainly had a positive impact on the boys’ problem-
solving process and their perception of themselves as creative mathematicians.  

Implications for practice 

Due to the positive results of this action, I will continue along the action research path 
with this project. I plan on revising the project for my next Advanced Topics in 
Mathematics class with the hope of creating different versions for each of my courses.  

The boys involved in the study have a great deal of interest in pursuing the publication of 
the iPad application. They have a plan in place to move forward with the remaining 
programming hurdles and hope to have an improved product in the near future.  

Reflection  

As a skeptic from the start, I have come to thoroughly appreciate and respect the practice 
of action research. I found myself to have many of the same bad problem-solving habits 
as my students did in the pre-action problem set: quick to jump to conclusions, relieved 
when early steps were complete, and eager to find “the right way” of completing 
components of this project. Having now made it through one round of the process, I am 
eager to refine my action, and revisit the action research cycle in the fall.  

This process has been perhaps the most valuable teaching exercise of my career. 
Reflective practice is an important component of every teacher’s growth, and the action 
research cycle is a remarkable tool for engaging in reflection and refinement.

Abstract 
 
Creativity is often far down the list of priorities for students, particularly boys, in the 
Mathematics classroom. Boys tend to put more emphasis on speed and accuracy than on 
being unique and useful (Loveless, 2007). While important, speed and accuracy, as goals, 
tend to push boys down what they think of as predetermined solution paths. What will 
happen to a boy’s creativity, and his perception thereof, if we remove the whole concept 
of predetermined paths, ask questions that have never been answered, and involve design 
in the solution process? 

In this action research study, four boys in a Capstone Level Mathematics Course 
completed three collaborative problem-solving projects. The first was a conventional 
problem set from an iPad-based text. The second, the action step, was to use iPad 
application development software to create a unique “app” that meets a mathematically 
relevant need that has yet to be met. The third task was to return to a conventional 
collaborative problem set. Data was collected at all three stages to determine if the 
project involving the creation of new knowledge had an impact on the boys’ level of 
creativity in problem solving.  

Findings indicate that developing new iPad applications had a significant impact on the 
boys’ interest in and ability to be creativity and their perception of their own creativity, 
and changed the boys’ view of the value of their own mistakes. The final project in this 
study, graded using the same metric as the initial project, though earning the same high 
mark, was completed in a manner such that the boys, by way of their own admission, 
enjoyed the experience more, got more out of the project, and made it more interesting 
for the instructor to review.  

 

These findings will inform the teaching practices of the researcher as well as his 
colleagues in their adoption of iPads in the classroom. Finding techniques, such as the 
application development project, to encourage creativity in new and old projects is of 
growing importance in an ever more competitive school environment. 

Introduction 

While the role of formal education remains to prepare future generations for sustaining 
and improving our social and economic environment, the environment itself is changing 
in such a way that requires our formal education construct to adapt. Such adaptation calls 
for creative problem solving, innovation, and design. In my experience as a teacher, I’ve 
noticed that content, while still a cornerstone of sound education, is becoming relatively 
less important. Information that was once difficult to access, is now readily available to 
the masses. Conversely, I see process as becoming relatively more important. What do 
we do with the information we have? As Bassett (2007) and others have predicted, a large 
percentage of the jobs our current students will hold do not yet exist. To that end, I was 
interested in how the use of technology could cultivate creativity in the Math classroom 
and change the boys’ perception of their own creative abilities.  

I have found my push to develop independent, creative, and thoughtful learners and 
students’ drive to gain admission to competitive universities to be more in conflict than in 
concert. I am concerned that we are encouraging our boys to walk too carefully in the 
footsteps of others, rather than teaching them to navigate their own path. My school has 
an ideal opportunity, with the adoption of iPads, the resources, and the energy, to enact 
more meaningful change in our classrooms than simply how we collect homework. This 
is an opportunity for us to break many of the links in Carol Dweck’s (2006) fixed mindset 
cycle and move towards developing a growth mindset culture in our students and our 
faculty. 

Choosing action research as a methodology requires, at the outset, a research question. I 
asked the following: How can the use of iPads and application development software in 
Math encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity? 

Using an action research approach allowed me to engage in extensive reflective practice, 
collect data to support findings, and further inform future actions. Ultimately, it was my 

goal to understand how boys could move from being product driven to being process 
driven when problem solving in the Math classroom. Action research calls for executing 
a new action, studying outcomes, revising said action, and cycling back; taking good 
teaching practice to a more formal investigation. This methodology allows for 
straightforward integration of research and evaluation into my current curriculum, thus 
making it a desirable construct. It was hoped that this formal iteration of action research 
would encourage similar projects in my classroom and those of my colleagues.  

Literature Review 

In an effort to explore how the use of iPads and application development software can 
encourage boys towards a growth mindset of creativity, relevant literature tends towards 
two conclusions: the types of challenges we offer our boys need to reflect the ones they 
will likely encounter in their professional lives (Reichert, 2010), and the iPad which 
offers new dynamic ways to engage with content (Burton, 2009). Within this project, we 
defined creativity as an imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that 
“are both original and of value” (Loveless, 2007).  

In the rapidly changing landscape of education and professional training, creativity is 
often identified, along with problem solving and critical thinking, as key to student 
success (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011). Attempts to change, or reinvent, the 
manner in which we school our children are not new, but many educators recognize that 
as we have moved into the 21st century, this need is greater than ever: “our students have 
changed radically. Today's students are no longer the people our education system was 
designed to teach” (Selwyn, 2011).  

Daniel Pink (2005) notes, “We are entering a new era when a new kind of thinking (right 
brain thinking) will also be required to succeed. This era, defined as the ‘conceptual age’ 
will, among other things, require the ability to see patterns, connect unrelated ideas, think 
creatively, empathize with others, and find meaning and purpose.” Furthering this idea of 
helping boys find meaning and purpose in their work, studies show that creating 
products, in this case iPad apps, that illustrate concepts, are useful, and that engage, are 
among teachers’ “most effective practices” (Reichert, 2010). 

With creativity being a newly emphasized and valued skill in the 21st century comes the 
challenge of intentionally building and cultivating it within our students. Encouraging 
creativity is a process that involves changing not only the types of work we do in the 
classroom, the way we assess, and what we focus on, but also our language (Mackel, 
2009). Treating creativity as a skill to be learned, rather than an inherent ability, opens 
the door to applying Carol Dweck’s (2006) work on fixed versus growth mindset. In a 
fixed mindset, notes Dweck, students spend time documenting their ability rather than 
developing it, whereas in a growth mindset, students believe that their most basic abilities 
are malleable.  

Research Context 

With a student body of 450 boys and 78 faculty, Belmont Hill School strives to develop 
the mind, body, and spirit through working together. Placing a high value on hard work, 
grit, and character, it is a place where success only arrives by way of committed effort.  

I chose my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class to participate in the action research 
project. The class consists of four boys, each of whom have completed Advanced 
Placement Calculus BC and are considered our top mathematics students at the school. 
These boys, who have achieved at a very high level, seemed well suited for a project that 
encouraged them to think in new ways. I took Parent Night as an opportunity to discuss 
the project with the boys’ parents, outline the process, and answer questions. I handed out 
permission forms to parents and boys, then followed with a description of the action, 
types of data collection, and the ways in which it would be used. Anonymity was ensured 
and the opportunity to opt out of the project given. Our Head of School and other 
administrative bodies were aware of and supportive of the project.  

The Action 

I believe our school has a track record of achieving exceptional results, and consequently 
our boys are often results driven. Unfortunately, the results-driven nature of our boys 
permeates the classroom experience, making it difficult to encourage creativity and 
exploration in daily tasks. I find that the fastest path to the correct solution is most 
desirable, when thoughtful and creative paths may be more fruitful. The goal of this 

action was to determine if, by using the iPad and application development software, boys 
would find ways to be more creative in this and in future projects. 

I challenged the boys to create iPad apps that meet a mathematical need or provide a 
math-related service that does not yet exist. Viewing that task as creating new knowledge 
is the key, unique action, to the project. After the completion of the assignment, I 
assessed the students’ view of their own creative problem-solving ability, comparing it to 
pre-action perceptions. We then performed a series of problem-solving tasks that do not 
involve creating new outcomes, comparing their work on these more familiar tasks to 
pre-action work. Having all of these boys in one class made the action and data collection 
feasible and, as I had the chance to author the curriculum, the course had built-in time for 
this collaboration.  

Data Collection 

Data collected for this study, largely qualitative, consisted of students’ written reflections, 
video recordings, classroom observation, and exam projects.  

The first step in the project was to have the boys complete a collaborative problem-
solving project in the field of Number Theory. The boys had been studying the subject for 
a month and had developed skills necessary for tackling more challenging problems. 
Problems assigned for this project came from the text the boys were using on their iPads. 
The boys were photographed and videoed during class time. That project was evaluated 
and feedback was given.  

Prior to the action, the boys were asked to write a paragraph responding to three separate 
prompts:  

1) Define creativity  

2) When do you feel that you’ve been creative in a math class; describe what that creative 
process looked like? 

3) Do you view your own creativity as fixed, or is it something that can be developed? 

The boys then began a project outside the field of Number Theory. They were asked to 
create an app for the iPad that was unique to anything they could find in the appstore and 

that met a need in the Calculus classroom. Throughout the project, I used my own iPad to 
record audio, video, and take still pictures of the collaborative work, individual work, and 
presentation processes. At different points throughout the process other teachers and 
administrators came into the classroom to observe. Their feedback was also collected as 
qualitative data for this study. 

Upon completion of the iPad application development, students were asked to revisit 
their own answers to the three prompts given earlier. Upon completion of the survey, we 
formed a focus group as students were quite interested in hearing from their peers and 
coming to a more common definition of creativity.  

The final component of the research project was to return to a collaborative project 
similar to the project immediately preceding the action (iPad application project). As part 
of the mid-year exam, the four boys were assigned a new Number Theory problem set 
from their iPad textbook. The project guidelines were the same as those from the pre-
action project. That assignment was evaluated and feedback was given.  

Data Analysis 

The data was analyzed in three different ways. The pre-action and post-action surveys 
were compared to determine changes in students’ definition of creativity, perception of 
their own creative abilities, and the role of creativity in the Math classroom. The surveys 
were read and responses were categorized by themes according to examples of creativity, 
students’ perception of their own creativity, and the ability to become more creative.  

Video footage was taken and outside observer data was used to determine if any changes 
in process, comfort level, or creativity occurred. The video was analyzed for changes in 
behavior during each of the three phases of the project. The researcher broke down 
footage from each stage into four-minute clips, tallying the frequency with which the 
boys demonstrated unique contributions, fear of failure, and indications of growth 
mindset.  

The pre-action and post-action projects were analyzed to determine if the “create new 
knowledge” activity had a positive impact on future problem-solving endeavors. While 

the projects were graded based on collaboration and accuracy, the researcher also 
evaluated the level of creativity of the solutions.  

Discussion of Results 
The table below contains an analysis of the video data collection. It represents the 
average frequency of observed behavior collected from ten four-minute clips from each 
of the stages of the study.

The rate at which students contributed unique ideas increased by 50% from the pre-action 
to action stages, and by 17% from pre-action to post-action stages. Students’ observed 
fear of failure decreased by 80% from pre-action to action steps, and by 40% from pre-
action to post-action. Lastly, students’ observed behavior regarding growth mindset 
increased by 175% between pre-action and action stages, and by 50% from pre-action to 
post-action stages.  

Pre-Action Survey 

Though the questions were intentionally open ended, there were five notable themes 
evident from the pre-action survey. Each of the four students described, in some manner, 
creativity as finding new solutions to old problems, one boy responding, “I think that 
creativity is the ability for people to make something new or different out of something 
already supplied.” Three of the four boys wrote about their own creative experiences 
exclusively in their primary school years. All four boys felt that creativity can be 
developed in young students, not mentioning adults. Each of the boys felt that people are 
born with varying levels of innate creativity. Finally, two of the boys identified creativity 
in Math as “different” from creativity in other areas.   

Pre-Action Problem-Solving Observations 

During the pre-action problem set, the students were observed seated in desks (an 
arrangement of their choosing) for more than 90% of the working time. This set-up, while 
collaborative in nature, allowed for limited sharing of ideas, largely in the form of 
conversation and trading iPads/notebooks for reviewing each other’s work. An outside 
faculty member observer noted, “The boys seem to be quick to ask for help, with peers 
quick to show them their work. Not a bad thing, but perhaps they could be grappling with 
it longer.” The same observer later noted that the boys seemed “eager to all have the 
same work on their iPads. When one student made progress, the other three wanted to 
imitate the work.” When a problem was solved, the boys appeared relieved, and eager to 
put it behind them.

Figure 2: They adopted the expression “Let’s hit the boards” as a common signal to share 
work.  

After considerable brainstorming and discussion, the four boys decided to build an iPad 
application for use in high school and college Calculus classes. They focused on the 
unique features of the device: portability, tactile nature, and interactive capabilities, as the 
foundation of the project. In doing so, they researched other interactive Calculus-based 
applications in the Apple and Android stores, as well as java-based web pages. They 
found many graphing and calculation tools that allowed the user to input a function, but 
none that allowed the user to input and evaluate a hand-drawn graph. Recalling the 
importance of being able to draw the graph of a derivative f’(x) given the graph of f(x), 
and vice-versa, they began to narrow their focus on an application that allowed the user to 
practice, and receive feedback, on this task.  

The boys spent the next five class periods in the abstract design phase. They determined 
that an application that would be able to output a derivative graph, based on a free-hand 
drawing of an input graph, would also be able to provide other valuable Calculus-based 
information. If the program could output a first derivative, they reasoned, then surely it 
would be able to draw any number of higher-order derivatives of the same parent graph. 
Recognizing the relationship between derivatives and integrals, they believed this 
application would also be able to calculate area under the curve and draw anti-
derivatives. They also felt that the applications should be able to draw tangent lines and 
perform linear approximations, secant slopes, as well as local and global extrema.

Once they determined the Math-based features of the application, they returned to a 
brainstorm to determine other unique features that could be integrated into the application 
based on the functionality of the iPad. The four boys felt that, in addition to the tactile 
interactivity of the device, the iPad is an effective tool for sharing work with other users. 
They wanted the user to have the ability to interact not only with the device, but also with 
other users of the application. They included the ability to save graphs and calculations, 
input images and files from other sources, and share graphs with other users. 

 

Fig 5: Screenshot of the ‘My Graphs’ page of the application  

 

The final task of the user experience design phase was to build a settings screen that 
would allow the user to customize the graph appearance, background and sizing, as well 
as make use of the multi-touch features of the iPad, such as multi-finger swiping.  

 

Fig 6: Screenshot of the ‘Settings’ page 

After they decided on the features of the application, they took to a storyboard process, 
planning how the user might navigate between screens. 

 

Fig 7: Screenshot of an early storyboard model 

 

Once they were satisfied with the design phase, they transitioned to the building phase. 
Of the four students in the class, two were experienced programmers. They split 
themselves up, based on experience and interest, into two teams. One, without previous 
programming experience, would use the xcode software available through Apple to build 
the user interface. They found it challenging to code from scratch, but learned how to use 
the drag and drop options in xcode to construct each of the user screens. The second 
group took to the task of writing the code to perform the foundational task of the 
application. Early attempts using the xcode language proved challenging, but after some 
research, they found that xcode would understand the Python programming language, one 
that both boys were familiar with. After a number of attempts, the two boys came up with 
a functioning prototype. 

Fig 8: Screenshot of the functioning prototype 

 

The boys were quite pleased with the progress that they had made, but were not satisfied. 
They came together as a group to try to determine what was causing the jagged nature of 
the derivative graphs (in red) based on the hand-drawn graphs (in black). The lead 
programmer described the algorithm in the code and the nature of the problem. The other 
boys, while not familiar with the coding, came up with ideas of how to work around the 
issues. Later attempts showed drastic improvements. 

Fig 9: Screenshot of later attempt 

 

The final code, part of which is shown below, is to my knowledge, the first of its kind to 
allow a user to draw a function and have the device instantly draw the graph of the 
derivative. 

 

Fig 10: The final code 

Post-Action Problem Solving 

The same outside faculty member spent time in the classroom during the post-action 
problem set. His observations had little to do with the Math involved and focused largely 
on the social dynamic and features of the process. He noted, “It’s really interesting to see 

their reactions to having completed a problem. They’re almost disappointed, maybe not 
disappointed, but they sound like they each want something different in their process.”  

As this problem set was the last of the semester, and knowing that it was part of a 
research project on creativity, they decided to hand in their work in clever ways. The 
boys devised a scavenger hunt for the instructor to follow. Each of the 16 solutions was 
hidden in some fashion, and an individual clue was given to the teacher/researcher to 
follow. Some were encrypted using Number Theory and others were hidden in the 
classroom. The boys sent videos, made on their iPads, as clues and/or demonstrations of 
solutions. Perhaps the most clever was an encryption, that, when decoded, became a local 
phone number. When dialed, the instructor was connected to a voicemail message with a 
personal greeting and solution. Relevant to the action research question or not, it appears 
that merely emphasizing creativity in a math course can inspire students to think in new 
and innovative ways. 

While the grade for both the pre-action and post-action problem sets was intended for use 
in analyzing data, both marks were perfect scores. 

Post-Action Survey 

Four major themes emerged from the post-action survey and discussion. All four boys 
felt less sure about the idea that each person has an innate level of creativity. The 
responses were largely focused on the process of solving problems rather than on the 
results. The fact that the boys were talking about the process of building an iPad 
application instead of the actual product indicates a potential shift towards a growth 
mindset cycle, one boy noting,  “People are often not creative because they think 
themselves not creative and therefore do not try to be. However, creativity is something 
you can become better and better at as you conscientiously attempt to come up with 
different ways of solving a problem.” All four boys responded that they felt empowered 
by the creativity they experienced during the action step. Lastly, each of the boys 
identified that the mistakes they made during and after the action step were more valuable 
learning experiences than the mistakes they made during the pre-action project. 

Post-action problem-solving collaboration 

Many of the same behaviors first seen during the iPad project continued into the post-
action problem set. Students much preferred “hitting the boards” while working in class, 
and creating iPad videos to share ideas and work done at home. While boys still shared 
their individual work with their peers, the group members rarely adopted the work 
shared. Instead, the boys watched and listened to each other, but returned to their own 
workspace and tried to make their solution unique.  

Focus Group Results 

The boys viewed the action project as a different kind of problem solving, simply 
because they knew “the answer didn’t exist, [they] were responsible for creating it.” 

One boy brought up the idea that he let himself “marinate longer in the unknown” during 
this project compared to others. The other three quickly jumped in and echoed the 
sentiment. “I’d never felt so ok not knowing something,” one boy contributed, “I think I’ll 
be more ok not knowing stuff from now on, as long as I eventually figure it out.”  

Then the conversation turned, without prompting, back to creativity. One boy 
remembered writing in his pre-action survey that creativity happens when you let your 
mind wander (“Creativity is hard to practice, because it comes from the lack of focus on 
any specific idea”), but wanted to revise his statement. “That time of not knowing the 
answer, that’s when I felt bursts of creativity. I guess, now that I’m thinking about it, it’s 
not lack of focus, but maybe a lack of a defined path. It’s like getting lost in the woods. 
First you look for a path, when you don’t find one, you eventually need to get creative 
and make your own.” 

When asked about their ability to contribute to the programming problem-solving 
process, the three non-programmers were elated to share their thoughts. The boys 
commented that they never would have thought it possible to help troubleshoot code, 
without ever knowing how to program. One boy noted, “I just never thought about it that 
way. When Trent told us about the pixel problem, we were able to come up with the ideas 
to solve it, and he was able to turn our ideas into code. I was psyched!”  

 

 

Conclusion 

In terms of the action research question posed, “How can the use of iPads and application 
development software encourage students towards a growth mindset in creativity?” the 
results reflect that it is possible for students to move along the mindset continuum 
towards growth with regard to creativity. Framing the exercise in the context of a creative 
endeavor appeared to play a meaningful role in the students’ experiences. The action 
project gave the boys a break from the conventional “faster is better” mentality that many 
boys employ, allowing them the time and space to “marinate,” create, and design in new 
ways. While a number of the same behaviors carried over from the pre- and post-action 
problem sets, the action project certainly had a positive impact on the boys’ problem-
solving process and their perception of themselves as creative mathematicians.  

Implications for practice 

Due to the positive results of this action, I will continue along the action research path 
with this project. I plan on revising the project for my next Advanced Topics in 
Mathematics class with the hope of creating different versions for each of my courses.  

The boys involved in the study have a great deal of interest in pursuing the publication of 
the iPad application. They have a plan in place to move forward with the remaining 
programming hurdles and hope to have an improved product in the near future.  

Reflection  

As a skeptic from the start, I have come to thoroughly appreciate and respect the practice 
of action research. I found myself to have many of the same bad problem-solving habits 
as my students did in the pre-action problem set: quick to jump to conclusions, relieved 
when early steps were complete, and eager to find “the right way” of completing 
components of this project. Having now made it through one round of the process, I am 
eager to refine my action, and revisit the action research cycle in the fall.  

This process has been perhaps the most valuable teaching exercise of my career. 
Reflective practice is an important component of every teacher’s growth, and the action 
research cycle is a remarkable tool for engaging in reflection and refinement.
