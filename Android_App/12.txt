Abstract 

The  embedded  systems  such  as  smart  phone,  tablet,  pocket  or 
pad  personal  computers  and  driving  navigator,  etc.  are  very 
popular  now.  The  operating  system  (OS)  of  embedded  system 
should  be  reduced  size,  operate  quickly,  user-friendly,  more 
functions  and  energy  saving  etc.  Many  manufacturers  are 
studying  for  embedded  systems,  for  example,  Apple  Ltd  is  for 
iOS,  Google  Ltd  is  for  Android  and  Microsoft  is  for  Windows 
mobile.  The  world's  major  researchers  and  scholars  begin  to 
study the Android OS on the embedded system, recently. In this 
paper,  the  Android  kernel  files  and  Wi-Fi  applications  are 
demonstrated by using the smart phone educational kit. The steps 
of manufactures for Android kernel files and Wi-Fi applications 
are  implemented  on  the  Android  educational  development  kit 
called  DMA  6410.  The  experimental  results  reveal  that  these 
results  possess  good  execution  performances  of  Android  kernel 
files  and  good  abilities  of  accessing  Google  map  by  using 
example of Wi-Fi adaptor.

1. Introduction 

Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either 
microcontrollers  or  digital  signal  processors  (DSP).  The 
key characteristic, however, is being dedicated to handle a 
particular task. Since the embedded system is dedicated to 
specific  tasks,  design  engineers  can  optimize  it  to  reduce 
the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability 
and performance. Some embedded systems are produced in 
order to benefit from economies. The Android kernel files 
are  logical  steps  based  on  the  bottom  layers  of  Linux 
operating system (OS) [1]. The purposes of kernel files are 
to allocate memory and switch the central processing unit 
(CPU) to different  execution  threads.  The  major  software 
of Android kernel files are files system, network interfaces 
and boot-loader, etc. 
The  Google  Ltd.  launched  the  open  Android  operating 
system  platform  in  November  2007  and  announced  the 
establishment  of  a  union  organization  called  the  Open 
Handset  Alliance  (OHA).  Google  Ltd.  also  promotes  the 
Android  for  smart  phone  OS  and  related  application 
softwares.  In  addition  to  the  Google  Ltd.,  the  alliance 
organization  has  includes  many  manufacturers  of  smart 

phone  developments,  telecommunications  companies  and 
application software development companies. The Android 
OS, in addition to be sent to the phone, meanwhile, it can 
be developed as embedded systems. Android is the world's 
most  popular  mobile  platform.  With  Android,  all  the 
Google application packages (Apps) can be used plus there 
are  more  than  600,000  Apps  and  games  available  on 
Google  Play  to  keep  them  entertained,  alongside  millions 
of  songs  and  books,  and  thousands  of  movies.  Android 
devices are already smart, and will  only get smarter,  with 
new features which won't be  found  on  any  other platform 
[2]. 
Android  has  become  the  most  popular  smart  phone  plat-
form, recently, and a number of online advertising compa-
nies  have  now  positioned  Android  as  the  popular  smart 
phone platform worldwide [3]. The various components of 
Android  are  designed  as  a  stack,  with  the  ‘Applications’ 
forming the top layer of the stack, while the Linux kernel 
forms  the  lowest  layer.  To  jump  start  the  Android  devel-
opment,  the  Android  software  development  kit  (SDK  for 
Linux) can be download from web. It includes sample pro-
jects  with  source  code,  development  tools,  an  emulator, 
and of  course all the  libraries which is necessary to build 
an  Android  applications.  Life  is  made  a  lot  simpler  with 
the  Eclipse  plug-in  for  Android  development,  called  the 
Android Development Tools (ADT). It basically brings the 
power of the IDE to Android development [4]. In the proc-
ess of Eclipse, it has acquired a large user base and a mul-
titude of applications have been built on it. Eclipse is built 
as a plugin-based framework. Its users can simply use it as 
an IDE, but they can also extend or build their own plugins 
from  the  existing  ones  [5].  Many  research  results  have 
been  developed  recently.  For  example,  an  Android-based 
3G phone is developed to establish enterprise applications 
of  ground  monitoring  of  aircraft  loading  and  production 
activities  at  the  airfield,  and  use  the  event  mechanism  to 
coordinate the production work of System Operation Con-
trol  Department  (SOC),  cargo  and  aircraft  maintenance 
factory  [6].  A  general  process  for  data  collection  of  An-
droid  devices  is  developed  by  exploring  special  device 
boot  modes  and  Android’s  partitioning  schema  [7].  To 
support collaboration of teams of mobile users by enabling 
anytime  and  anywhere  access  to  shared  contact  data  [8].

widely [9-15]. In [9], they study to integrate a cloud com-
puting  mechanism  into  the  Android  platform,  allowing 
service  providers  to  upload  their  telematic  bundles  onto 
storage  clouds  using  a  provisioning  server.  In  [10],  they 
intend  to  explore  different  perspectives,  features  &  suit-
ability  of  android  for  mobile  devices  &  comparison  be-
tween Android, Symbian & Windows mobile OS. In [11], 
they examine the level of accuracy that can be achieved in 
precision  positioning  by  using  built-in  sensors  in  an  An-
droid  smart  phone.  In  [12],  Android  based  mobile  phone 
has  been  completely  tested  and  analyzed  in  Egypt  roads 
using realistic data. In [13], an Android phone application, 
GeoTools,  has  been  created  to  assist  geologists  with  the 
collection  of  field  data,  as  well  as  data  management.  In 
[14], the authors integrate 3G communication technology, 
Android  embedded  system  and  aquaculture-cages  remote 
monitoring, which makes up for the deficiency of the tradi-
tional  aquaculture-cages  monitoring.  In  [15],  they  present 
how to communicate between different heterogeneous con-
text  aware  platforms  as  WComp  and  OpenORB  by  using 
Android and Web Services. 
The  Wireless  Fidelity  (Wi-Fi)  Alliance  defines  Wi-Fi  as 
any wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are 
based  on  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics 
Engineers  (IEEE)  802.11  standards.  However,  since  most 
modern  WLANs  are  based  on  these  standards,  the  term 
"Wi-Fi"  is  used  in  general  English  as  a  synonym  for 
"WLAN".  The  Wi-Fi  is  a  popular  technology  that  allows 
an electronic  device to exchange data wirelessly  by  using 
radio  waves  over  a  computer  network,  including  high-
speed Internet connections and it can connect to a network 
resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access 
point  (AP)  [1].  Each  wireless  router  broadcasts  a  signal 
that is received by devices in the area. These devices have 
the  capability  to  measure  the  strength  of  the  signal.  This 
strength is converted to a number, known as received sig-
nal strength indicator (RSSI). Wi-Fi devices, such as smart 
phones, typically perform this conversion automatically in 
order to provide signal strength information to applications 
running on it [11]. The security assessment of the Android 
framework-Google's software stack for mobile devices has 
been discussed. The high-risk threats to the framework and 
suggestions  of  several  security  solutions  for  mitigating 
have also been provided [16]. 
In  this  paper,  the  Android  development  kit  embedded  of 
ARM-11  based  Samsung  6410  CPU  [17]  called  DMA 
6410 manufactured by DMATEK Ltd, Taiwan [18] is used 
to do empirical test of accessing Google map by using Wi-
Fi.  The  experimental  results  reveal 
the  good 
performances are possessed.

2. The Development of Android Software 

‘system’->  setting 

Android  Application  is  developed  by  software  develop-
ment kits (SDK) issued by android web [2]. It is combined 
of  many  tools  such  as  JDK(Java  Development  Kit), 
Eclipse,  ADT(Android  Development  Tools),  Android 
SDK  and  Linux  kernel,  etc.  All  these  developed  Android 
applications must be based on this operating system (OS) 
of Linux. In this paper, the Ubuntu Linux OS is used. 
The installation steps are described as follows. At first, to 
install Java JDK-> install Eclipse-> install Android SDK-> 
install ADT. After this procedures of installation are com-
pleted,  the  file  folder  of  ‘android-sdk-windows’  will  be 
appeared in folder of disk C: . This path of file folder must 
be set appropriate to be pointed by other applications. The 
setting  steps  are  from  clicking  on  the  icon  of  ‘My 
Computer’  at  first,  then  click  right  mouse  button,  select 
‘Contents’ and click the right of mouse button to enter the 
‘system  Properties’-> 
screen  of 
‘Advanced’-> 
‘environment 
variables’->  ‘system  variables’->  press  ‘edit’  to  find  a 
variable  field  of  ‘Path’->  paste  file  folder  of  "JDK"  and 
"SDK" into this field of variables. Finally, the installation 
is  completed  and  the  ADT  can  be  run  smoothly.  The 
development  environment  diagram  is  shown  as  in  Fig.  1. 
The  Java  software  development  kit  is  necessary  for 
compiling the library files of Android applications. At first, 
the  tool  called  ‘Putty’  is  used  to  communicate  the  Java 
machine. In the environment of Putty, we can compile the 
head  file  and  C  language  file  of  Android  by  using  the 
command  of  ‘javah  -classpath’.  This  command  will 
generate the necessary file of type of ‘.h’ which is used to 
define  the  ports  of  every  devices  on  Android  systems.  In 
order  to  compile  all  these  applications  software  to  be 
‘.apk’  file  successfully,  they  must  be  configured  with  the 
Android kernel files system which will be discussed in next 
section.

The architecture of Android platform can be found in [4, 9, 
10,  19].  By  analyzing  the  codes  of  Android  kernel  and 
comparing  to  the  standardize  Linux  kernel,  they  analyze 
and  discuss  the  difference  between  Android  kernel  and 
standard kernel and the advantage of Android. Meanwhile, 
they point out the position of Android in the Linux kernel 
system to compile a customize kernel on the Linux or Ub-
untu system [9, 19]. Android is  not just an operating sys-
tem  but  provides  a  complete  software  stack  including  a 
middleware and some built in applications. Android archi-
tecture is composed of different layers, with the Linux ker-
nel  layer at the bottom. This layer provides  various  hard-
ware drivers and acts as a hardware abstraction layer. It is 
also responsible for memory and power management func-
tionalities of Android. The Android native libraries written 
in  C  and  C++  sit  above  the  kernel  layer.  These  libraries 
provide  some  core  functionalities.  Next  is  the  Android 
runtime layer which is composed of two principle compo-
nents  namely  Dalvik  Virtual  Machine  and  Android  core 
libraries. Android runtime  is  specially  designed  as  an  op-
timized  environment  to  meet  the  requirements  of  running 
on  an  embedded  system  i.e.,  limited  battery  life,  CPU 
speed  and  memory.  Dalvik  virtual  machine  executes  its 
own  byte-code  represented  by  dex  (Dalvik  EXcutable) 
files.  The  second  component  of  Android  runtime  is  the 
collection  of  class  libraries  written  in  Java  programming 
language,  which  contains  all  of  the  collection  classes  and 
inputs/outputs (I/O) utilities. In Dalvik, the code responsi-
ble for calling class loaders is present in three major files, 
that is, Class.c, Internal Native.c and JNI.c. The two broad 
categories  of  classes  in  Dalvik  are  system  classes  and 
(what we informally term as) standard classes. [20].  
Android  architecture  is  shown  in  Fig.  2,  which  consists 
four layers. The bottom layer is Linux kernel, up to library 
and runtime layer which is a collection of Android libraries 
and runtime virtual machine; third layer is framework layer 
that manages Android applications in runtime; top layer is 
application layer which is native or third-party applications 
[4, 9, 10, 19]. These layers are described as follows. 
(cid:1) 

The lowest layer is Linux kernel which manages core 
services  such  as  device  hardware  drivers,  process 
and  memory  management,  security,  network,  and 
power  management.  The  kernel  also  acts  as  an  ab-
straction layer between the hardware and the rest of 
the software stack.  

(cid:1)  Android  includes  various  C/C++  core  libraries  run-
ning  on  top  of  the  kernel.  The  Android  Libraries 
layer consists of two parts as Libraries which are all 
written in C/C++. They will be called through a Java 
interface  and  it  includes  the  Surface  Manager,  2D 
and  3D  graphics,  Media  Codecs  like  MPEG-4  and 
MP3, the SQL database SQLite and the web browser 

(cid:1) 

(cid:1) 

engine  WebKit.  Second  part  is  Android  Runtime 
which  includes  a  set  of  core  libraries  that  provides 
most of the functionality available in the core librar-
ies  of  the  Java  programming  language.  Second  is 
Dalvik  virtual  machine  (DVM)  which  is  a  register-
based  architecture  and  runs  Java  applications  with 
the  Dalvik  Executable  (.dex)  format  which  is  opti-
mized to allow  multiple  VM  instances  to  run  at  the 
same time. 
The  Framework  layer  is  a  software  that  is  used  to 
implement a standard structure of an application for 
a specific operating system. With the help of manag-
ers,  content  providers  and  other  services  program-
mers it can reassemble functions used by other exist-
ing  applications.  Every  Android  application  runs  in 
its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik 
virtual machine. The Dalvik VM executes files in the 
Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is  optimized 
for  minimal  memory  footprint.  Android  has  built  in 
integrated browser based on the open source WebKit 
engine  &  built  in  powerful  SQL  database  engine 
called  SQLite,  use  for  structured  data  storage.  An-
droid support for common audio, video, and still im-
age  formats  such  as  AAC,  MPEG4,  H.264,  MP3, 
AMR,  &  contains  Rich  development  environment 
including a device emulator, tools for debugging, & 
a plug-in for the Eclipse. 
The application framework provides the classes used 
to create Android applications. It also provides a ge-
neric abstraction layer for hardware access and man-
ages  the  user  interface  and  application  resources. 
Application  layer  using  API  libraries  is  the  upper-
most layer which provides a set of core applications 
including  an  email,  SMS  program,  calendar,  maps, 
browser,  contacts,  etc.  All  applications  are  written 
using  the  Java  programming  language.  It  should  be 
mentioned  that  applications  can  be  run  simultane-
ously; it is possible to hear music and read an email 
at the same time.  

In this paper, the kernel files of Android are manufactured 
by some tools; there are Vmware or VirtualBox running in 
OS  environment  of  MicrosoftTM  WindowTM  installed  in 
personal  computer  (PC),  network  communication  tools 
such as ‘Putty’, ‘Tera Term’ or ‘Tftp’ etc. The compressed 
zip  type  files  are  released  from  DMATEK  Ltd,  Taiwan. 
The operation steps are described as follows. 

Step 1: To install tool of Vmware to open virtual host 
server  to  communicate  the  virtual  server  of  Samba  in 
WindowTM.  

Step  2:  To  install  tool  of  Putty  to  translate  files 
between  Linux  and  WindowTM.  All  kernel  files  can  be 
unziped  and  made  in  Putty  to  manufacture  Android  boot 
and image files.

Abstract 

The  embedded  systems  such  as  smart  phone,  tablet,  pocket  or 
pad  personal  computers  and  driving  navigator,  etc.  are  very 
popular  now.  The  operating  system  (OS)  of  embedded  system 
should  be  reduced  size,  operate  quickly,  user-friendly,  more 
functions  and  energy  saving  etc.  Many  manufacturers  are 
studying  for  embedded  systems,  for  example,  Apple  Ltd  is  for 
iOS,  Google  Ltd  is  for  Android  and  Microsoft  is  for  Windows 
mobile.  The  world's  major  researchers  and  scholars  begin  to 
study the Android OS on the embedded system, recently. In this 
paper,  the  Android  kernel  files  and  Wi-Fi  applications  are 
demonstrated by using the smart phone educational kit. The steps 
of manufactures for Android kernel files and Wi-Fi applications 
are  implemented  on  the  Android  educational  development  kit 
called  DMA  6410.  The  experimental  results  reveal  that  these 
results  possess  good  execution  performances  of  Android  kernel 
files  and  good  abilities  of  accessing  Google  map  by  using 
example of Wi-Fi adaptor.  
Keywords: Android, Wi-Fi, Embedded systems, Software. 

1. Introduction 

Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either 
microcontrollers  or  digital  signal  processors  (DSP).  The 
key characteristic, however, is being dedicated to handle a 
particular task. Since the embedded system is dedicated to 
specific  tasks,  design  engineers  can  optimize  it  to  reduce 
the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability 
and performance. Some embedded systems are produced in 
order to benefit from economies. The Android kernel files 
are  logical  steps  based  on  the  bottom  layers  of  Linux 
operating system (OS) [1]. The purposes of kernel files are 
to allocate memory and switch the central processing unit 
(CPU) to different  execution  threads.  The  major  software 
of Android kernel files are files system, network interfaces 
and boot-loader, etc. 
The  Google  Ltd.  launched  the  open  Android  operating 
system  platform  in  November  2007  and  announced  the 
establishment  of  a  union  organization  called  the  Open 
Handset  Alliance  (OHA).  Google  Ltd.  also  promotes  the 
Android  for  smart  phone  OS  and  related  application 
softwares.  In  addition  to  the  Google  Ltd.,  the  alliance 
organization  has  includes  many  manufacturers  of  smart 

phone  developments,  telecommunications  companies  and 
application software development companies. The Android 
OS, in addition to be sent to the phone, meanwhile, it can 
be developed as embedded systems. Android is the world's 
most  popular  mobile  platform.  With  Android,  all  the 
Google application packages (Apps) can be used plus there 
are  more  than  600,000  Apps  and  games  available  on 
Google  Play  to  keep  them  entertained,  alongside  millions 
of  songs  and  books,  and  thousands  of  movies.  Android 
devices are already smart, and will  only get smarter,  with 
new features which won't be  found  on  any  other platform 
[2]. 
Android  has  become  the  most  popular  smart  phone  plat-
form, recently, and a number of online advertising compa-
nies  have  now  positioned  Android  as  the  popular  smart 
phone platform worldwide [3]. The various components of 
Android  are  designed  as  a  stack,  with  the  ‘Applications’ 
forming the top layer of the stack, while the Linux kernel 
forms  the  lowest  layer.  To  jump  start  the  Android  devel-
opment,  the  Android  software  development  kit  (SDK  for 
Linux) can be download from web. It includes sample pro-
jects  with  source  code,  development  tools,  an  emulator, 
and of  course all the  libraries which is necessary to build 
an  Android  applications.  Life  is  made  a  lot  simpler  with 
the  Eclipse  plug-in  for  Android  development,  called  the 
Android Development Tools (ADT). It basically brings the 
power of the IDE to Android development [4]. In the proc-
ess of Eclipse, it has acquired a large user base and a mul-
titude of applications have been built on it. Eclipse is built 
as a plugin-based framework. Its users can simply use it as 
an IDE, but they can also extend or build their own plugins 
from  the  existing  ones  [5].  Many  research  results  have 
been  developed  recently.  For  example,  an  Android-based 
3G phone is developed to establish enterprise applications 
of  ground  monitoring  of  aircraft  loading  and  production 
activities  at  the  airfield,  and  use  the  event  mechanism  to 
coordinate the production work of System Operation Con-
trol  Department  (SOC),  cargo  and  aircraft  maintenance 
factory  [6].  A  general  process  for  data  collection  of  An-
droid  devices  is  developed  by  exploring  special  device 
boot  modes  and  Android’s  partitioning  schema  [7].  To 
support collaboration of teams of mobile users by enabling 
anytime  and  anywhere  access  to  shared  contact  data  [8].

widely [9-15]. In [9], they study to integrate a cloud com-
puting  mechanism  into  the  Android  platform,  allowing 
service  providers  to  upload  their  telematic  bundles  onto 
storage  clouds  using  a  provisioning  server.  In  [10],  they 
intend  to  explore  different  perspectives,  features  &  suit-
ability  of  android  for  mobile  devices  &  comparison  be-
tween Android, Symbian & Windows mobile OS. In [11], 
they examine the level of accuracy that can be achieved in 
precision  positioning  by  using  built-in  sensors  in  an  An-
droid  smart  phone.  In  [12],  Android  based  mobile  phone 
has  been  completely  tested  and  analyzed  in  Egypt  roads 
using realistic data. In [13], an Android phone application, 
GeoTools,  has  been  created  to  assist  geologists  with  the 
collection  of  field  data,  as  well  as  data  management.  In 
[14], the authors integrate 3G communication technology, 
Android  embedded  system  and  aquaculture-cages  remote 
monitoring, which makes up for the deficiency of the tradi-
tional  aquaculture-cages  monitoring.  In  [15],  they  present 
how to communicate between different heterogeneous con-
text  aware  platforms  as  WComp  and  OpenORB  by  using 
Android and Web Services. 
The  Wireless  Fidelity  (Wi-Fi)  Alliance  defines  Wi-Fi  as 
any wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are 
based  on  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics 
Engineers  (IEEE)  802.11  standards.  However,  since  most 
modern  WLANs  are  based  on  these  standards,  the  term 
"Wi-Fi"  is  used  in  general  English  as  a  synonym  for 
"WLAN".  The  Wi-Fi  is  a  popular  technology  that  allows 
an electronic  device to exchange data wirelessly  by  using 
radio  waves  over  a  computer  network,  including  high-
speed Internet connections and it can connect to a network 
resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access 
point  (AP)  [1].  Each  wireless  router  broadcasts  a  signal 
that is received by devices in the area. These devices have 
the  capability  to  measure  the  strength  of  the  signal.  This 
strength is converted to a number, known as received sig-
nal strength indicator (RSSI). Wi-Fi devices, such as smart 
phones, typically perform this conversion automatically in 
order to provide signal strength information to applications 
running on it [11]. The security assessment of the Android 
framework-Google's software stack for mobile devices has 
been discussed. The high-risk threats to the framework and 
suggestions  of  several  security  solutions  for  mitigating 
have also been provided [16]. 
In  this  paper,  the  Android  development  kit  embedded  of 
ARM-11  based  Samsung  6410  CPU  [17]  called  DMA 
6410 manufactured by DMATEK Ltd, Taiwan [18] is used 
to do empirical test of accessing Google map by using Wi-
Fi.  The  experimental  results  reveal 
the  good 
performances are possessed.

2. The Development of Android Software 

‘system’->  setting 

Android  Application  is  developed  by  software  develop-
ment kits (SDK) issued by android web [2]. It is combined 
of  many  tools  such  as  JDK(Java  Development  Kit), 
Eclipse,  ADT(Android  Development  Tools),  Android 
SDK  and  Linux  kernel,  etc.  All  these  developed  Android 
applications must be based on this operating system (OS) 
of Linux. In this paper, the Ubuntu Linux OS is used. 
The installation steps are described as follows. At first, to 
install Java JDK-> install Eclipse-> install Android SDK-> 
install ADT. After this procedures of installation are com-
pleted,  the  file  folder  of  ‘android-sdk-windows’  will  be 
appeared in folder of disk C: . This path of file folder must 
be set appropriate to be pointed by other applications. The 
setting  steps  are  from  clicking  on  the  icon  of  ‘My 
Computer’  at  first,  then  click  right  mouse  button,  select 
‘Contents’ and click the right of mouse button to enter the 
‘system  Properties’-> 
screen  of 
‘Advanced’-> 
‘environment 
variables’->  ‘system  variables’->  press  ‘edit’  to  find  a 
variable  field  of  ‘Path’->  paste  file  folder  of  "JDK"  and 
"SDK" into this field of variables. Finally, the installation 
is  completed  and  the  ADT  can  be  run  smoothly.  The 
development  environment  diagram  is  shown  as  in  Fig.  1. 
The  Java  software  development  kit  is  necessary  for 
compiling the library files of Android applications. At first, 
the  tool  called  ‘Putty’  is  used  to  communicate  the  Java

generate the necessary file of type of ‘.h’ which is used to 
define  the  ports  of  every  devices  on  Android  systems.  In 
order  to  compile  all  these  applications  software  to  be 
‘.apk’  file  successfully,  they  must  be  configured  with  the 
Android kernel files system which will be discussed in next 
section.

kernal  files  into  flash  memory  of  target  by  using  the 
Ethernet port. 

Step 4: To configure the parameters by using the Tera 

Term to open and run the devices. 
In next section, the example of Wi-Fi will be demonstrated 
to reveal the effectiveness and performances for these steps 
of manufacture for boot and kernel files.

shown in Fig. 3. At first, the boot file must be copied in SD 
card  to start the target.  The needed image files  which are 
manufactured  by  the  aforementioned  steps  should  be 
burned  into  target  through  Ethernet  line  between  PC  and 
DMA 6410. There are five image files which are ‘u-boot’, 
‘kernel’, ‘ramdisk’, ‘userdata’ and ‘system’ files. Then, we 
can use the tools of Tera Term and Tftp to set the network 
parameters and to burn the aforementioned five kernel files 
into flash memory of  target.  The  implementation  diagram 
is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  Baud  rate  is  set  as  115200,  the 
Baud rate setting diagram of Tera Term is shown in Fig. 5. 
The  target  IP  is  set  as  192.168.2.144,  server  IP  is  set  as

your DNS IP which can be checked by using command of 
‘ipconfig’ on window console). 
The  screen  images  diagram  of  burning  process  on  PC  is 
shown in Fig. 8. After this process is completed, the Wi-Fi 
can  be  active  and  connected  with  AP.  Finally,  the  web 
browser  can  be  open  and  accessed;  for  example,  the 
Google map is accessed and shown in Fig. 9. 

4. Experimental Results 

The hardware is manufactured by different design, the ker-
nel  files  must  provided  by  the  manufacture  company.  In 
this paper, the DMA 6410 is used which is manufactured 
by  DMATEK  Ltd.,  Taiwan.  All  the  necessary  source  files 
of  Linux  kernel,  Android  cross  compile  tools  and  make 
files, etc. are released from this company. The hardware of 
kit is shown in Fig. 3 which is called DMA 6410. This is a 
friendly  using,  researching  and  teaching  development  kit. 
In this kit, the Samsung S3C6410 mobile processor is used 
to  give  designers  an  unbeatable  combination  of  3D  per-
formance and low power in a cost-effective package. This 
is a 32-bit ARM11 RISC microprocessor with AXI 64-bit 
bus delivers up to 667MHz of  processing performance. It 
can  power  next-generation  handhelds,  such  as  mobile 
Internet  devices  and  3D  UI-enhanced  multimedia  phones, 
as well as personal navigation devices that display detailed 
images  like  buildings  and  landmarks.  Memory  support 
includes  dual  DRAM  and  flash/ROM  external  memory 
ports for parallel access. The DRAM port can support mo-
bile DDR, standard SDRAM memory while the flash/ROM 
port supports NAND flash, NOR flash and ROM [17].

Abstract 

The  embedded  systems  such  as  smart  phone,  tablet,  pocket  or 
pad  personal  computers  and  driving  navigator,  etc.  are  very 
popular  now.  The  operating  system  (OS)  of  embedded  system 
should  be  reduced  size,  operate  quickly,  user-friendly,  more 
functions  and  energy  saving  etc.  Many  manufacturers  are 
studying  for  embedded  systems,  for  example,  Apple  Ltd  is  for 
iOS,  Google  Ltd  is  for  Android  and  Microsoft  is  for  Windows 
mobile.  The  world's  major  researchers  and  scholars  begin  to 
study the Android OS on the embedded system, recently. In this 
paper,  the  Android  kernel  files  and  Wi-Fi  applications  are 
demonstrated by using the smart phone educational kit. The steps 
of manufactures for Android kernel files and Wi-Fi applications 
are  implemented  on  the  Android  educational  development  kit 
called  DMA  6410.  The  experimental  results  reveal  that  these 
results  possess  good  execution  performances  of  Android  kernel 
files  and  good  abilities  of  accessing  Google  map  by  using 
example of Wi-Fi adaptor.

1. Introduction 

Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either 
microcontrollers  or  digital  signal  processors  (DSP).  The 
key characteristic, however, is being dedicated to handle a 
particular task. Since the embedded system is dedicated to 
specific  tasks,  design  engineers  can  optimize  it  to  reduce 
the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability 
and performance. Some embedded systems are produced in 
order to benefit from economies. The Android kernel files 
are  logical  steps  based  on  the  bottom  layers  of  Linux 
operating system (OS) [1]. The purposes of kernel files are 
to allocate memory and switch the central processing unit 
(CPU) to different  execution  threads.  The  major  software 
of Android kernel files are files system, network interfaces 
and boot-loader, etc. 
The  Google  Ltd.  launched  the  open  Android  operating 
system  platform  in  November  2007  and  announced  the 
establishment  of  a  union  organization  called  the  Open 
Handset  Alliance  (OHA).  Google  Ltd.  also  promotes  the 
Android  for  smart  phone  OS  and  related  application 
softwares.  In  addition  to  the  Google  Ltd.,  the  alliance 
organization  has  includes  many  manufacturers  of  smart 

phone  developments,  telecommunications  companies  and 
application software development companies. The Android 
OS, in addition to be sent to the phone, meanwhile, it can 
be developed as embedded systems. Android is the world's 
most  popular  mobile  platform.  With  Android,  all  the 
Google application packages (Apps) can be used plus there 
are  more  than  600,000  Apps  and  games  available  on 
Google  Play  to  keep  them  entertained,  alongside  millions 
of  songs  and  books,  and  thousands  of  movies.  Android 
devices are already smart, and will  only get smarter,  with 
new features which won't be  found  on  any  other platform 
[2]. 
Android  has  become  the  most  popular  smart  phone  plat-
form, recently, and a number of online advertising compa-
nies  have  now  positioned  Android  as  the  popular  smart 
phone platform worldwide [3]. The various components of 
Android  are  designed  as  a  stack,  with  the  ‘Applications’ 
forming the top layer of the stack, while the Linux kernel 
forms  the  lowest  layer.  To  jump  start  the  Android  devel-
opment,  the  Android  software  development  kit  (SDK  for 
Linux) can be download from web. It includes sample pro-
jects  with  source  code,  development  tools,  an  emulator, 
and of  course all the  libraries which is necessary to build 
an  Android  applications.  Life  is  made  a  lot  simpler  with 
the  Eclipse  plug-in  for  Android  development,  called  the 
Android Development Tools (ADT). It basically brings the 
power of the IDE to Android development [4]. In the proc-
ess of Eclipse, it has acquired a large user base and a mul-
titude of applications have been built on it. Eclipse is built 
as a plugin-based framework. Its users can simply use it as 
an IDE, but they can also extend or build their own plugins 
from  the  existing  ones  [5].  Many  research  results  have 
been  developed  recently.  For  example,  an  Android-based 
3G phone is developed to establish enterprise applications 
of  ground  monitoring  of  aircraft  loading  and  production 
activities  at  the  airfield,  and  use  the  event  mechanism  to 
coordinate the production work of System Operation Con-
trol  Department  (SOC),  cargo  and  aircraft  maintenance 
factory  [6].  A  general  process  for  data  collection  of  An-
droid  devices  is  developed  by  exploring  special  device 
boot  modes  and  Android’s  partitioning  schema  [7].  To 
support collaboration of teams of mobile users by enabling 
anytime  and  anywhere  access  to  shared  contact  data  [8].

widely [9-15]. In [9], they study to integrate a cloud com-
puting  mechanism  into  the  Android  platform,  allowing 
service  providers  to  upload  their  telematic  bundles  onto 
storage  clouds  using  a  provisioning  server.  In  [10],  they 
intend  to  explore  different  perspectives,  features  &  suit-
ability  of  android  for  mobile  devices  &  comparison  be-
tween Android, Symbian & Windows mobile OS. In [11], 
they examine the level of accuracy that can be achieved in 
precision  positioning  by  using  built-in  sensors  in  an  An-
droid  smart  phone.  In  [12],  Android  based  mobile  phone 
has  been  completely  tested  and  analyzed  in  Egypt  roads 
using realistic data. In [13], an Android phone application, 
GeoTools,  has  been  created  to  assist  geologists  with  the 
collection  of  field  data,  as  well  as  data  management.  In 
[14], the authors integrate 3G communication technology, 
Android  embedded  system  and  aquaculture-cages  remote 
monitoring, which makes up for the deficiency of the tradi-
tional  aquaculture-cages  monitoring.  In  [15],  they  present 
how to communicate between different heterogeneous con-
text  aware  platforms  as  WComp  and  OpenORB  by  using 
Android and Web Services. 
The  Wireless  Fidelity  (Wi-Fi)  Alliance  defines  Wi-Fi  as 
any wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are 
based  on  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics 
Engineers  (IEEE)  802.11  standards.  However,  since  most 
modern  WLANs  are  based  on  these  standards,  the  term 
"Wi-Fi"  is  used  in  general  English  as  a  synonym  for 
"WLAN".  The  Wi-Fi  is  a  popular  technology  that  allows 
an electronic  device to exchange data wirelessly  by  using 
radio  waves  over  a  computer  network,  including  high-
speed Internet connections and it can connect to a network 
resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access 
point  (AP)  [1].  Each  wireless  router  broadcasts  a  signal 
that is received by devices in the area. These devices have 
the  capability  to  measure  the  strength  of  the  signal.  This 
strength is converted to a number, known as received sig-
nal strength indicator (RSSI). Wi-Fi devices, such as smart 
phones, typically perform this conversion automatically in 
order to provide signal strength information to applications 
running on it [11]. The security assessment of the Android 
framework-Google's software stack for mobile devices has 
been discussed. The high-risk threats to the framework and 
suggestions  of  several  security  solutions  for  mitigating 
have also been provided [16]. 
In  this  paper,  the  Android  development  kit  embedded  of 
ARM-11  based  Samsung  6410  CPU  [17]  called  DMA 
6410 manufactured by DMATEK Ltd, Taiwan [18] is used 
to do empirical test of accessing Google map by using Wi-
Fi.  The  experimental  results  reveal 
the  good 
performances are possessed.

2. The Development of Android Software 

‘system’->  setting 

Android  Application  is  developed  by  software  develop-
ment kits (SDK) issued by android web [2]. It is combined 
of  many  tools  such  as  JDK(Java  Development  Kit), 
Eclipse,  ADT(Android  Development  Tools),  Android 
SDK  and  Linux  kernel,  etc.  All  these  developed  Android 
applications must be based on this operating system (OS) 
of Linux. In this paper, the Ubuntu Linux OS is used. 
The installation steps are described as follows. At first, to 
install Java JDK-> install Eclipse-> install Android SDK-> 
install ADT. After this procedures of installation are com-
pleted,  the  file  folder  of  ‘android-sdk-windows’  will  be 
appeared in folder of disk C: . This path of file folder must 
be set appropriate to be pointed by other applications. The 
setting  steps  are  from  clicking  on  the  icon  of  ‘My 
Computer’  at  first,  then  click  right  mouse  button,  select 
‘Contents’ and click the right of mouse button to enter the 
‘system  Properties’-> 
screen  of 
‘Advanced’-> 
‘environment 
variables’->  ‘system  variables’->  press  ‘edit’  to  find  a 
variable  field  of  ‘Path’->  paste  file  folder  of  "JDK"  and 
"SDK" into this field of variables. Finally, the installation 
is  completed  and  the  ADT  can  be  run  smoothly.  The 
development  environment  diagram  is  shown  as  in  Fig.  1. 
The  Java  software  development  kit  is  necessary  for 
compiling the library files of Android applications. At first, 
the  tool  called  ‘Putty’  is  used  to  communicate  the  Java 
machine. In the environment of Putty, we can compile the 
head  file  and  C  language  file  of  Android  by  using  the 
command  of  ‘javah  -classpath’.  This  command  will 
generate the necessary file of type of ‘.h’ which is used to 
define  the  ports  of  every  devices  on  Android  systems.  In 
order  to  compile  all  these  applications  software  to  be 
‘.apk’  file  successfully,  they  must  be  configured  with  the 
Android kernel files system which will be discussed in next 
section.

The architecture of Android platform can be found in [4, 9, 
10,  19].  By  analyzing  the  codes  of  Android  kernel  and 
comparing  to  the  standardize  Linux  kernel,  they  analyze 
and  discuss  the  difference  between  Android  kernel  and 
standard kernel and the advantage of Android. Meanwhile, 
they point out the position of Android in the Linux kernel 
system to compile a customize kernel on the Linux or Ub-
untu system [9, 19]. Android is  not just an operating sys-
tem  but  provides  a  complete  software  stack  including  a 
middleware and some built in applications. Android archi-
tecture is composed of different layers, with the Linux ker-
nel  layer at the bottom. This layer provides  various  hard-
ware drivers and acts as a hardware abstraction layer. It is 
also responsible for memory and power management func-
tionalities of Android. The Android native libraries written 
in  C  and  C++  sit  above  the  kernel  layer.  These  libraries 
provide  some  core  functionalities.  Next  is  the  Android 
runtime layer which is composed of two principle compo-
nents  namely  Dalvik  Virtual  Machine  and  Android  core 
libraries. Android runtime  is  specially  designed  as  an  op-
timized  environment  to  meet  the  requirements  of  running 
on  an  embedded  system  i.e.,  limited  battery  life,  CPU 
speed  and  memory.  Dalvik  virtual  machine  executes  its 
own  byte-code  represented  by  dex  (Dalvik  EXcutable) 
files.  The  second  component  of  Android  runtime  is  the 
collection  of  class  libraries  written  in  Java  programming 
language,  which  contains  all  of  the  collection  classes  and 
inputs/outputs (I/O) utilities. In Dalvik, the code responsi-
ble for calling class loaders is present in three major files, 
that is, Class.c, Internal Native.c and JNI.c. The two broad 
categories  of  classes  in  Dalvik  are  system  classes  and 
(what we informally term as) standard classes. [20].  
Android  architecture  is  shown  in  Fig.  2,  which  consists 
four layers. The bottom layer is Linux kernel, up to library 
and runtime layer which is a collection of Android libraries 
and runtime virtual machine; third layer is framework layer 
that manages Android applications in runtime; top layer is 
application layer which is native or third-party applications 
[4, 9, 10, 19]. These layers are described as follows. 
(cid:1) 

The lowest layer is Linux kernel which manages core 
services  such  as  device  hardware  drivers,  process 
and  memory  management,  security,  network,  and 
power  management.  The  kernel  also  acts  as  an  ab-
straction layer between the hardware and the rest of 
the software stack.  

(cid:1)  Android  includes  various  C/C++  core  libraries  run-
ning  on  top  of  the  kernel.  The  Android  Libraries 
layer consists of two parts as Libraries which are all 
written in C/C++. They will be called through a Java 
interface  and  it  includes  the  Surface  Manager,  2D 
and  3D  graphics,  Media  Codecs  like  MPEG-4  and 
MP3, the SQL database SQLite and the web browser 

(cid:1) 

(cid:1) 

engine  WebKit.  Second  part  is  Android  Runtime 
which  includes  a  set  of  core  libraries  that  provides 
most of the functionality available in the core librar-
ies  of  the  Java  programming  language.  Second  is 
Dalvik  virtual  machine  (DVM)  which  is  a  register-
based  architecture  and  runs  Java  applications  with 
the  Dalvik  Executable  (.dex)  format  which  is  opti-
mized to allow  multiple  VM  instances  to  run  at  the 
same time. 
The  Framework  layer  is  a  software  that  is  used  to 
implement a standard structure of an application for 
a specific operating system. With the help of manag-
ers,  content  providers  and  other  services  program-
mers it can reassemble functions used by other exist-
ing  applications.  Every  Android  application  runs  in 
its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik 
virtual machine. The Dalvik VM executes files in the 
Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is  optimized 
for  minimal  memory  footprint.  Android  has  built  in 
integrated browser based on the open source WebKit 
engine  &  built  in  powerful  SQL  database  engine 
called  SQLite,  use  for  structured  data  storage.  An-
droid support for common audio, video, and still im-
age  formats  such  as  AAC,  MPEG4,  H.264,  MP3, 
AMR,  &  contains  Rich  development  environment 
including a device emulator, tools for debugging, & 
a plug-in for the Eclipse. 
The application framework provides the classes used 
to create Android applications. It also provides a ge-
neric abstraction layer for hardware access and man-
ages  the  user  interface  and  application  resources. 
Application  layer  using  API  libraries  is  the  upper-
most layer which provides a set of core applications 
including  an  email,  SMS  program,  calendar,  maps, 
browser,  contacts,  etc.  All  applications  are  written 
using  the  Java  programming  language.  It  should  be 
mentioned  that  applications  can  be  run  simultane-
ously; it is possible to hear music and read an email 
at the same time.  

In this paper, the kernel files of Android are manufactured 
by some tools; there are Vmware or VirtualBox running in 
OS  environment  of  MicrosoftTM  WindowTM  installed  in 
personal  computer  (PC),  network  communication  tools 
such as ‘Putty’, ‘Tera Term’ or ‘Tftp’ etc. The compressed 
zip  type  files  are  released  from  DMATEK  Ltd,  Taiwan. 
The operation steps are described as follows. 

Step 1: To install tool of Vmware to open virtual host 
server  to  communicate  the  virtual  server  of  Samba  in 
WindowTM.  

Step  2:  To  install  tool  of  Putty  to  translate  files 
between  Linux  and  WindowTM.  All  kernel  files  can  be 
unziped  and  made  in  Putty  to  manufacture  Android  boot 
and image files.

kernal  files  into  flash  memory  of  target  by  using  the 
Ethernet port. 

Step 4: To configure the parameters by using the Tera 

Term to open and run the devices. 
In next section, the example of Wi-Fi will be demonstrated 
to reveal the effectiveness and performances for these steps 
of manufacture for boot and kernel files.

shown in Fig. 3. At first, the boot file must be copied in SD 
card  to start the target.  The needed image files  which are 
manufactured  by  the  aforementioned  steps  should  be 
burned  into  target  through  Ethernet  line  between  PC  and 
DMA 6410. There are five image files which are ‘u-boot’, 
‘kernel’, ‘ramdisk’, ‘userdata’ and ‘system’ files. Then, we 
can use the tools of Tera Term and Tftp to set the network 
parameters and to burn the aforementioned five kernel files 
into flash memory of  target.  The  implementation  diagram 
is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  Baud  rate  is  set  as  115200,  the 
Baud rate setting diagram of Tera Term is shown in Fig. 5. 
The  target  IP  is  set  as  192.168.2.144,  server  IP  is  set  as 
192.168.2.110, then save these settings which is shown in 
Fig 6. The active setting for Wi-Fi is implemented by using 
the command of ‘ifconfig’ in Tera Term also. The setting 
commands  are  listed  as  follows  and  the  implementation 
diagram of Wi-Fi is shown in Fig. 7. 
#ifconfig wlan0 up 
#wpa_supplicant –Dwext –iwlan0 –
c/system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf& 
#netcfg wlan0 dhcp 
#setprop  net.dns1  xxx.xx.xxx.xxx  (where  the  ‘x’  implies 
your DNS IP which can be checked by using command of 
‘ipconfig’ on window console). 
The  screen  images  diagram  of  burning  process  on  PC  is 
shown in Fig. 8. After this process is completed, the Wi-Fi 
can  be  active  and  connected  with  AP.  Finally,  the  web 
browser  can  be  open  and  accessed;  for  example,  the 
Google map is accessed and shown in Fig. 9. 

4. Experimental Results 

The hardware is manufactured by different design, the ker-
nel  files  must  provided  by  the  manufacture  company.  In 
this paper, the DMA 6410 is used which is manufactured 
by  DMATEK  Ltd.,  Taiwan.  All  the  necessary  source  files 
of  Linux  kernel,  Android  cross  compile  tools  and  make 
files, etc. are released from this company. The hardware of 
kit is shown in Fig. 3 which is called DMA 6410. This is a 
friendly  using,  researching  and  teaching  development  kit. 
In this kit, the Samsung S3C6410 mobile processor is used 
to  give  designers  an  unbeatable  combination  of  3D  per-
formance and low power in a cost-effective package. This 
is a 32-bit ARM11 RISC microprocessor with AXI 64-bit 
bus delivers up to 667MHz of  processing performance. It 
can  power  next-generation  handhelds,  such  as  mobile 
Internet  devices  and  3D  UI-enhanced  multimedia  phones, 
as well as personal navigation devices that display detailed 
images  like  buildings  and  landmarks.  Memory  support 
includes  dual  DRAM  and  flash/ROM  external  memory 
ports for parallel access. The DRAM port can support mo-
bile DDR, standard SDRAM memory while the flash/ROM 
port supports NAND flash, NOR flash and ROM [17]. 
In this section, the kernel files and software setting of Wi-
Fi  are  executed  on  the  DMA  6410  kit  which  has  been

Abstract 

The  embedded  systems  such  as  smart  phone,  tablet,  pocket  or 
pad  personal  computers  and  driving  navigator,  etc.  are  very 
popular  now.  The  operating  system  (OS)  of  embedded  system 
should  be  reduced  size,  operate  quickly,  user-friendly,  more 
functions  and  energy  saving  etc.  Many  manufacturers  are 
studying  for  embedded  systems,  for  example,  Apple  Ltd  is  for 
iOS,  Google  Ltd  is  for  Android  and  Microsoft  is  for  Windows 
mobile.  The  world's  major  researchers  and  scholars  begin  to 
study the Android OS on the embedded system, recently. In this 
paper,  the  Android  kernel  files  and  Wi-Fi  applications  are 
demonstrated by using the smart phone educational kit. The steps 
of manufactures for Android kernel files and Wi-Fi applications 
are  implemented  on  the  Android  educational  development  kit 
called  DMA  6410.  The  experimental  results  reveal  that  these

1. Introduction 

Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either 
microcontrollers  or  digital  signal  processors  (DSP).  The 
key characteristic, however, is being dedicated to handle a 
particular task. Since the embedded system is dedicated to 
specific  tasks,  design  engineers  can  optimize  it  to  reduce 
the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability 
and performance. Some embedded systems are produced in 
order to benefit from economies. The Android kernel files 
are  logical  steps  based  on  the  bottom  layers  of  Linux 
operating system (OS) [1]. The purposes of kernel files are 
to allocate memory and switch the central processing unit 
(CPU) to different  execution  threads.  The  major  software 
of Android kernel files are files system, network interfaces 
and boot-loader, etc. 
The  Google  Ltd.  launched  the  open  Android  operating 
system  platform  in  November  2007  and  announced  the 
establishment  of  a  union  organization  called  the  Open 
Handset  Alliance  (OHA).  Google  Ltd.  also  promotes  the 
Android  for  smart  phone  OS  and  related  application 
softwares.  In  addition  to  the  Google  Ltd.,  the  alliance 
organization  has  includes  many  manufacturers  of  smart 

phone  developments,  telecommunications  companies  and 
application software development companies. The Android 
OS, in addition to be sent to the phone, meanwhile, it can 
be developed as embedded systems. Android is the world's 
most  popular  mobile  platform.  With  Android,  all  the 
Google application packages (Apps) can be used plus there 
are  more  than  600,000  Apps  and  games  available  on 
Google  Play  to  keep  them  entertained,  alongside  millions 
of  songs  and  books,  and  thousands  of  movies.  Android 
devices are already smart, and will  only get smarter,  with 
new features which won't be  found  on  any  other platform 
[2]. 
Android  has  become  the  most  popular  smart  phone  plat-
form, recently, and a number of online advertising compa-
nies  have  now  positioned  Android  as  the  popular  smart 
phone platform worldwide [3]. The various components of 
Android  are  designed  as  a  stack,  with  the  ‘Applications’ 
forming the top layer of the stack, while the Linux kernel 
forms  the  lowest  layer.  To  jump  start  the  Android  devel-
opment,  the  Android  software  development  kit  (SDK  for 
Linux) can be download from web. It includes sample pro-
jects  with  source  code,  development  tools,  an  emulator, 
and of  course all the  libraries which is necessary to build 
an  Android  applications.  Life  is  made  a  lot  simpler  with 
the  Eclipse  plug-in  for  Android  development,  called  the 
Android Development Tools (ADT). It basically brings the 
power of the IDE to Android development [4]. In the proc-
ess of Eclipse, it has acquired a large user base and a mul-
titude of applications have been built on it. Eclipse is built 
as a plugin-based framework. Its users can simply use it as 
an IDE, but they can also extend or build their own plugins 
from  the  existing  ones  [5].  Many  research  results  have 
been  developed  recently.  For  example,  an  Android-based 
3G phone is developed to establish enterprise applications 
of  ground  monitoring  of  aircraft  loading  and  production 
activities  at  the  airfield,  and  use  the  event  mechanism  to 
coordinate the production work of System Operation Con-
trol  Department  (SOC),  cargo  and  aircraft  maintenance 
factory  [6].  A  general  process  for  data  collection  of  An-
droid  devices  is  developed  by  exploring  special  device 
boot  modes  and  Android’s  partitioning  schema  [7].  To 
support collaboration of teams of mobile users by enabling 
anytime  and  anywhere  access  to  shared  contact  data  [8].

widely [9-15]. In [9], they study to integrate a cloud com-
puting  mechanism  into  the  Android  platform,  allowing 
service  providers  to  upload  their  telematic  bundles  onto 
storage  clouds  using  a  provisioning  server.  In  [10],  they 
intend  to  explore  different  perspectives,  features  &  suit-
ability  of  android  for  mobile  devices  &  comparison  be-
tween Android, Symbian & Windows mobile OS. In [11], 
they examine the level of accuracy that can be achieved in 
precision  positioning  by  using  built-in  sensors  in  an  An-
droid  smart  phone.  In  [12],  Android  based  mobile  phone 
has  been  completely  tested  and  analyzed  in  Egypt  roads 
using realistic data. In [13], an Android phone application, 
GeoTools,  has  been  created  to  assist  geologists  with  the 
collection  of  field  data,  as  well  as  data  management.  In 
[14], the authors integrate 3G communication technology, 
Android  embedded  system  and  aquaculture-cages  remote 
monitoring, which makes up for the deficiency of the tradi-
tional  aquaculture-cages  monitoring.  In  [15],  they  present 
how to communicate between different heterogeneous con-
text  aware  platforms  as  WComp  and  OpenORB  by  using 
Android and Web Services. 
The  Wireless  Fidelity  (Wi-Fi)  Alliance  defines  Wi-Fi  as 
any wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are 
based  on  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics 
Engineers  (IEEE)  802.11  standards.  However,  since  most 
modern  WLANs  are  based  on  these  standards,  the  term 
"Wi-Fi"  is  used  in  general  English  as  a  synonym  for 
"WLAN".  The  Wi-Fi  is  a  popular  technology  that  allows 
an electronic  device to exchange data wirelessly  by  using 
radio  waves  over  a  computer  network,  including  high-
speed Internet connections and it can connect to a network 
resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access 
point  (AP)  [1].  Each  wireless  router  broadcasts  a  signal 
that is received by devices in the area. These devices have 
the  capability  to  measure  the  strength  of  the  signal.  This 
strength is converted to a number, known as received sig-
nal strength indicator (RSSI). Wi-Fi devices, such as smart 
phones, typically perform this conversion automatically in 
order to provide signal strength information to applications 
running on it [11]. The security assessment of the Android 
framework-Google's software stack for mobile devices has 
been discussed. The high-risk threats to the framework and 
suggestions  of  several  security  solutions  for  mitigating 
have also been provided [16]. 
In  this  paper,  the  Android  development  kit  embedded  of 
ARM-11  based  Samsung  6410  CPU  [17]  called  DMA 
6410 manufactured by DMATEK Ltd, Taiwan [18] is used 
to do empirical test of accessing Google map by using Wi-
Fi.  The  experimental  results  reveal 
the  good 
performances are possessed.

2. The Development of Android Software 

‘system’->  setting 

Android  Application  is  developed  by  software  develop-
ment kits (SDK) issued by android web [2]. It is combined 
of  many  tools  such  as  JDK(Java  Development  Kit), 
Eclipse,  ADT(Android  Development  Tools),  Android 
SDK  and  Linux  kernel,  etc.  All  these  developed  Android 
applications must be based on this operating system (OS) 
of Linux. In this paper, the Ubuntu Linux OS is used. 
The installation steps are described as follows. At first, to 
install Java JDK-> install Eclipse-> install Android SDK-> 
install ADT. After this procedures of installation are com-
pleted,  the  file  folder  of  ‘android-sdk-windows’  will  be 
appeared in folder of disk C: . This path of file folder must 
be set appropriate to be pointed by other applications. The 
setting  steps  are  from  clicking  on  the  icon  of  ‘My 
Computer’  at  first,  then  click  right  mouse  button,  select 
‘Contents’ and click the right of mouse button to enter the 
‘system  Properties’-> 
screen  of 
‘Advanced’-> 
‘environment 
variables’->  ‘system  variables’->  press  ‘edit’  to  find  a 
variable  field  of  ‘Path’->  paste  file  folder  of  "JDK"  and 
"SDK" into this field of variables. Finally, the installation 
is  completed  and  the  ADT  can  be  run  smoothly.  The 
development  environment  diagram  is  shown  as  in  Fig.  1. 
The  Java  software  development  kit  is  necessary  for 
compiling the library files of Android applications. At first, 
the  tool  called  ‘Putty’  is  used  to  communicate  the  Java 
machine. In the environment of Putty, we can compile the 
head  file  and  C  language  file  of  Android  by  using  the 
command  of  ‘javah  -classpath’.  This  command  will 
generate the necessary file of type of ‘.h’ which is used to 
define  the  ports  of  every  devices  on  Android  systems.  In 
order  to  compile  all  these  applications  software  to  be 
‘.apk’  file  successfully,  they  must  be  configured  with  the 
Android kernel files system which will be discussed in next 
section.

The architecture of Android platform can be found in [4, 9, 
10,  19].  By  analyzing  the  codes  of  Android  kernel  and 
comparing  to  the  standardize  Linux  kernel,  they  analyze 
and  discuss  the  difference  between  Android  kernel  and 
standard kernel and the advantage of Android. Meanwhile, 
they point out the position of Android in the Linux kernel 
system to compile a customize kernel on the Linux or Ub-
untu system [9, 19]. Android is  not just an operating sys-
tem  but  provides  a  complete  software  stack  including  a 
middleware and some built in applications. Android archi-
tecture is composed of different layers, with the Linux ker-
nel  layer at the bottom. This layer provides  various  hard-
ware drivers and acts as a hardware abstraction layer. It is 
also responsible for memory and power management func-
tionalities of Android. The Android native libraries written 
in  C  and  C++  sit  above  the  kernel  layer.  These  libraries 
provide  some  core  functionalities.  Next  is  the  Android 
runtime layer which is composed of two principle compo-
nents  namely  Dalvik  Virtual  Machine  and  Android  core 
libraries. Android runtime  is  specially  designed  as  an  op-
timized  environment  to  meet  the  requirements  of  running 
on  an  embedded  system  i.e.,  limited  battery  life,  CPU 
speed  and  memory.  Dalvik  virtual  machine  executes  its 
own  byte-code  represented  by  dex  (Dalvik  EXcutable) 
files.  The  second  component  of  Android  runtime  is  the 
collection  of  class  libraries  written  in  Java  programming 
language,  which  contains  all  of  the  collection  classes  and 
inputs/outputs (I/O) utilities. In Dalvik, the code responsi-
ble for calling class loaders is present in three major files, 
that is, Class.c, Internal Native.c and JNI.c. The two broad 
categories  of  classes  in  Dalvik  are  system  classes  and 
(what we informally term as) standard classes. [20].  
Android  architecture  is  shown  in  Fig.  2,  which  consists 
four layers. The bottom layer is Linux kernel, up to library 
and runtime layer which is a collection of Android libraries 
and runtime virtual machine; third layer is framework layer 
that manages Android applications in runtime; top layer is 
application layer which is native or third-party applications 
[4, 9, 10, 19]. These layers are described as follows. 
(cid:1) 

The lowest layer is Linux kernel which manages core 
services  such  as  device  hardware  drivers,  process 
and  memory  management,  security,  network,  and 
power  management.  The  kernel  also  acts  as  an  ab-
straction layer between the hardware and the rest of 
the software stack.  

(cid:1)  Android  includes  various  C/C++  core  libraries  run-
ning  on  top  of  the  kernel.  The  Android  Libraries 
layer consists of two parts as Libraries which are all 
written in C/C++. They will be called through a Java 
interface  and  it  includes  the  Surface  Manager,  2D 
and  3D  graphics,  Media  Codecs  like  MPEG-4  and 
MP3, the SQL database SQLite and the web browser 

(cid:1) 

(cid:1) 

engine  WebKit.  Second  part  is  Android  Runtime 
which  includes  a  set  of  core  libraries  that  provides 
most of the functionality available in the core librar-
ies  of  the  Java  programming  language.  Second  is 
Dalvik  virtual  machine  (DVM)  which  is  a  register-
based  architecture  and  runs  Java  applications  with 
the  Dalvik  Executable  (.dex)  format  which  is  opti-
mized to allow  multiple  VM  instances  to  run  at  the 
same time. 
The  Framework  layer  is  a  software  that  is  used  to 
implement a standard structure of an application for 
a specific operating system. With the help of manag-
ers,  content  providers  and  other  services  program-
mers it can reassemble functions used by other exist-
ing  applications.  Every  Android  application  runs  in 
its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik 
virtual machine. The Dalvik VM executes files in the 
Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is  optimized 
for  minimal  memory  footprint.  Android  has  built  in 
integrated browser based on the open source WebKit 
engine  &  built  in  powerful  SQL  database  engine 
called  SQLite,  use  for  structured  data  storage.  An-
droid support for common audio, video, and still im-
age  formats  such  as  AAC,  MPEG4,  H.264,  MP3, 
AMR,  &  contains  Rich  development  environment 
including a device emulator, tools for debugging, & 
a plug-in for the Eclipse. 
The application framework provides the classes used 
to create Android applications. It also provides a ge-
neric abstraction layer for hardware access and man-
ages  the  user  interface  and  application  resources. 
Application  layer  using  API  libraries  is  the  upper-
most layer which provides a set of core applications 
including  an  email,  SMS  program,  calendar,  maps, 
browser,  contacts,  etc.  All  applications  are  written 
using  the  Java  programming  language.  It  should  be 
mentioned  that  applications  can  be  run  simultane-
ously; it is possible to hear music and read an email 
at the same time.  

In this paper, the kernel files of Android are manufactured 
by some tools; there are Vmware or VirtualBox running in 
OS  environment  of  MicrosoftTM  WindowTM  installed  in 
personal  computer  (PC),  network  communication  tools 
such as ‘Putty’, ‘Tera Term’ or ‘Tftp’ etc. The compressed 
zip  type  files  are  released  from  DMATEK  Ltd,  Taiwan. 
The operation steps are described as follows. 

Step 1: To install tool of Vmware to open virtual host 
server  to  communicate  the  virtual  server  of  Samba  in 
WindowTM.  

Step  2:  To  install  tool  of  Putty  to  translate  files 
between  Linux  and  WindowTM.  All  kernel  files  can  be 
unziped  and  made  in  Putty  to  manufacture  Android  boot 
and image files.

kernal  files  into  flash  memory  of  target  by  using  the 
Ethernet port. 

Step 4: To configure the parameters by using the Tera 

Term to open and run the devices. 
In next section, the example of Wi-Fi will be demonstrated 
to reveal the effectiveness and performances for these steps 
of manufacture for boot and kernel files.

shown in Fig. 3. At first, the boot file must be copied in SD 
card  to start the target.  The needed image files  which are 
manufactured  by  the  aforementioned  steps  should  be 
burned  into  target  through  Ethernet  line  between  PC  and 
DMA 6410. There are five image files which are ‘u-boot’, 
‘kernel’, ‘ramdisk’, ‘userdata’ and ‘system’ files. Then, we 
can use the tools of Tera Term and Tftp to set the network 
parameters and to burn the aforementioned five kernel files 
into flash memory of  target.  The  implementation  diagram 
is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  Baud  rate  is  set  as  115200,  the 
Baud rate setting diagram of Tera Term is shown in Fig. 5. 
The  target  IP  is  set  as  192.168.2.144,  server  IP  is  set  as 
192.168.2.110, then save these settings which is shown in 
Fig 6. The active setting for Wi-Fi is implemented by using 
the command of ‘ifconfig’ in Tera Term also. The setting 
commands  are  listed  as  follows  and  the  implementation 
diagram of Wi-Fi is shown in Fig. 7. 
#ifconfig wlan0 up 
#wpa_supplicant –Dwext –iwlan0 –
c/system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf& 
#netcfg wlan0 dhcp 
#setprop  net.dns1  xxx.xx.xxx.xxx  (where  the  ‘x’  implies 
your DNS IP which can be checked by using command of 
‘ipconfig’ on window console). 
The  screen  images  diagram  of  burning  process  on  PC  is 
shown in Fig. 8. After this process is completed, the Wi-Fi 
can  be  active  and  connected  with  AP.  Finally,  the  web 
browser  can  be  open  and  accessed;  for  example,  the 
Google map is accessed and shown in Fig. 9. 

4. Experimental Results 

The hardware is manufactured by different design, the ker-
nel  files  must  provided  by  the  manufacture  company.  In 
this paper, the DMA 6410 is used which is manufactured 
by  DMATEK  Ltd.,  Taiwan.  All  the  necessary  source  files 
of  Linux  kernel,  Android  cross  compile  tools  and  make 
files, etc. are released from this company. The hardware of 
kit is shown in Fig. 3 which is called DMA 6410. This is a 
friendly  using,  researching  and  teaching  development  kit. 
In this kit, the Samsung S3C6410 mobile processor is used 
to  give  designers  an  unbeatable  combination  of  3D  per-
formance and low power in a cost-effective package. This 
is a 32-bit ARM11 RISC microprocessor with AXI 64-bit 
bus delivers up to 667MHz of  processing performance. It 
can  power  next-generation  handhelds,  such  as  mobile 
Internet  devices  and  3D  UI-enhanced  multimedia  phones, 
as well as personal navigation devices that display detailed 
images  like  buildings  and  landmarks.  Memory  support 
includes  dual  DRAM  and  flash/ROM  external  memory 
ports for parallel access. The DRAM port can support mo-
bile DDR, standard SDRAM memory while the flash/ROM 
port supports NAND flash, NOR flash and ROM [17]. 
In this section, the kernel files and software setting of Wi-
Fi  are  executed  on  the  DMA  6410  kit  which  has  been
