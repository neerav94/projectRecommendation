Abstract 

In recent, domestic livestock farms are receiving enormous damages through various 
livestock diseases that are highly contagious such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian 
influenza (AI). Additionally, they are experiencing difficulties also financially as a result 
of decrease in income from production cost increase. This paper will propose a livestock 
disease forecasting system for diagnosing in advance livestock disease status in real-time 
through  image  information  of  livestock  by  using  thermal  image  camera.  The  proposed 
system  can  extract  livestock  temperature  information  through  images  collected  from 
thermal image camera to diagnose in advance livestock disease status through Android-
based smart phone. Based on this, it is expected to contribute to the enhancement of the 
productivity  of  livestock  farms  and  their  competitiveness  by  minimizing  damages  from 
livestock disease by preventing disease damages in advance.

1. Introduction 

In  recent,  annual  domestic  meat  consumption  per  head  has  increased  by  more  than 
twofold  from  19.9kg  in  1990  to  43.5kg  in  2011,  thereby  occupying  significant 
percentages. However, domestic livestock industry is experiencing many difficulties as a 
result of increase in die rate from various livestock diseases and increase in production 
cost such as feed & energy costs [1]. 

Since 2000,  highly  contagious  diseases  have  been  occurring  such as foot-and-mouth 
disease and avian influenza. Accordingly, serious damages occurred in front back industry 
with about 3.4 million heads of livestock slaughter disposal and about 4 trillion won in 
damages [2, 4].

As shown in Table 1, number of foot-and-mouth slaughter disposal is shown compared 
to that in December 2010. The percentage of cow slaughter disposal from foot-and-mouth 
disease is about 5% with 150,000 heads among 2.9 million heads and the percentage of 
pig slaughter disposal is 33.6% with 3.3 million head among 10 million heads, thereby 
showing that damages of livestock farms are inevitable. To solve such issue, there is a 
need  for  technology  that  can  diagnose  in  advance  livestock  disease  and  increase 
production amount to enhance the competitiveness of domestic livestock industry [1, 3]. 

Although there are various methods of predicting livestock disease such as the method 
through livestock activity amount and the method of utilizing body insertion type sensor, 
it is difficult to check directly through visual inspection with a concern for causing issue 
in livestock safety [5, 6]. 

Accordingly,  a  disease  forecasting  system  using  thermal  image  came  is  proposed  in 
this paper. Thermal image camera is high reliable as it is being used in various areas such 
as healthcare, architecture design, etc. and it can solve safety issue through its non-contact 
type.  In  the  proposed  system,  server  that  extracts  and  manages  livestock  temperature 
information  from  images  collected  by  using  thermal  image  camera  comparatively 
analyzes the information with livestock disease determination standard value to diagnose 
in advance disease occurrence status, which is notified to Android-based smart phone user 
that  has  been  spread  widely  to  reduce  livestock  disease  damage  to  contribute  to  the 
productivity enhancement of livestock farms [5, 6]. 

The  composition  of  this  paper  is  as  follows.  Chapter  2  explains  the  composition

performance of activity detector can be estimated as it detects even slight rut signal 
of "silent rut". 

These  data  can  be  checked  through  De  Laval's  program  called  ALPRO  through 
which breeding calendar, smart breeding filter, breeding printout & rut alarm can be 
checked.  Based  on  activity  level,  it  automatically  predicts  breeding  and  detects 
disease and infection according to activity reduction and  activity amount for early

2.3. Livestock Disease Diagnosis Purpose Ear Insertion Type Module & Monitoring 
System (ETRI) 

This  system  that  has  been  developed  by  the  top  research  institution  of  our  country 
ETRI is a monitoring system to prevent the spread of disease through early identification 
of disease occurrence such as foot-and-mouth disease based on the temperature measured 
through reader or temperature transmitted periodically upon inserting RFID sensor chip 
that can measure livestock temperature into the ear of livestock [9]. 

In the case of existing body insertion type RFID sensor tag, it had the disadvantage of 
difficulty in the recycling of RFID sensor, as well as short recognition distance of RFID 
chip.  It  also  threatened  the  safety  of  consumer  through  its  loss  and  damage  inside  the 
body,  along  with  the  possibility  of  bodily  abnormality  occurrence  when  it  is  inserted 
inside the body. In the case of attachment type RFID sensor tag, there was a difficulty in 
accurately  sensing  inside  body  temperature  as  it  is  exposed  externally.  As  shown  in 
Figure 4, this ear insertion type module has alleviate the issues of existing temperature 
sensing by inserting it into livestock ear by inserting a rice grain size temperature sensor 
into polyurethane material module.

Abstract 

In recent, domestic livestock farms are receiving enormous damages through various 
livestock diseases that are highly contagious such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian 
influenza (AI). Additionally, they are experiencing difficulties also financially as a result 
of decrease in income from production cost increase. This paper will propose a livestock 
disease forecasting system for diagnosing in advance livestock disease status in real-time 
through  image  information  of  livestock  by  using  thermal  image  camera.  The  proposed 
system  can  extract  livestock  temperature  information  through  images  collected  from 
thermal image camera to diagnose in advance livestock disease status through Android-
based smart phone. Based on this, it is expected to contribute to the enhancement of the 
productivity  of  livestock  farms  and  their  competitiveness  by  minimizing  damages  from 
livestock disease by preventing disease damages in advance.

1. Introduction 

In  recent,  annual  domestic  meat  consumption  per  head  has  increased  by  more  than 
twofold  from  19.9kg  in  1990  to  43.5kg  in  2011,  thereby  occupying  significant 
percentages. However, domestic livestock industry is experiencing many difficulties as a 
result of increase in die rate from various livestock diseases and increase in production 
cost such as feed & energy costs [1]. 

Since 2000,  highly  contagious  diseases  have  been  occurring  such as foot-and-mouth 
disease and avian influenza. Accordingly, serious damages occurred in front back industry 
with about 3.4 million heads of livestock slaughter disposal and about 4 trillion won in 
damages [2, 4].

As shown in Table 1, number of foot-and-mouth slaughter disposal is shown compared 
to that in December 2010. The percentage of cow slaughter disposal from foot-and-mouth 
disease is about 5% with 150,000 heads among 2.9 million heads and the percentage of 
pig slaughter disposal is 33.6% with 3.3 million head among 10 million heads, thereby 
showing that damages of livestock farms are inevitable. To solve such issue, there is a 
need  for  technology  that  can  diagnose  in  advance  livestock  disease  and  increase 
production amount to enhance the competitiveness of domestic livestock industry [1, 3]. 

Although there are various methods of predicting livestock disease such as the method 
through livestock activity amount and the method of utilizing body insertion type sensor, 
it is difficult to check directly through visual inspection with a concern for causing issue 
in livestock safety [5, 6]. 

Accordingly,  a  disease  forecasting  system  using  thermal  image  came  is  proposed  in 
this paper. Thermal image camera is high reliable as it is being used in various areas such 
as healthcare, architecture design, etc. and it can solve safety issue through its non-contact 
type.  In  the  proposed  system,  server  that  extracts  and  manages  livestock  temperature 
information  from  images  collected  by  using  thermal  image  camera  comparatively 
analyzes the information with livestock disease determination standard value to diagnose 
in advance disease occurrence status, which is notified to Android-based smart phone user 
that  has  been  spread  widely  to  reduce  livestock  disease  damage  to  contribute  to  the 
productivity enhancement of livestock farms [5, 6]. 

The  composition  of  this  paper  is  as  follows.  Chapter  2  explains  the  composition 
diagram  and  flow  chart  of  Android-based  livestock  disease  forecasting  system  using 
thermal  image,  and  Chapter  3  analyzes  the  implementation  of  system.  Lastly,  the 
conclusion will present a future study direction and expected effect of this system through 
conclusion.

De  Laval  activity  detection  system  monitors  the  activity  of  each  entity  and 
breeding status. Through the analysis of entity activity, it identifies low activity that 
shows rut surge and health condition and detects such activity in advance to allow 
swift  measure  such  as  artificial  insemination  on  time.  As  for  livestock  activity, 
activity data of each entity is collected and transmitted each hour through wireless 
connection of antenna and necklace attached with activity detector.

De Laval herd test management program attached with activity detection system 
drastically reduces breeding cost through reduced non-pregnant condition days and 
insemination  frequency  with  up  to  95%  of  rut  detection  performance.  The 
performance of activity detector can be estimated as it detects even slight rut signal 
of "silent rut". 

These  data  can  be  checked  through  De  Laval's  program  called  ALPRO  through 
which breeding calendar, smart breeding filter, breeding printout & rut alarm can be 
checked.  Based  on  activity  level,  it  automatically  predicts  breeding  and  detects 
disease and infection according to activity reduction and  activity amount for early 
warning.

2.3. Livestock Disease Diagnosis Purpose Ear Insertion Type Module & Monitoring 
System (ETRI) 

This  system  that  has  been  developed  by  the  top  research  institution  of  our  country 
ETRI is a monitoring system to prevent the spread of disease through early identification 
of disease occurrence such as foot-and-mouth disease based on the temperature measured 
through reader or temperature transmitted periodically upon inserting RFID sensor chip 
that can measure livestock temperature into the ear of livestock [9]. 

In the case of existing body insertion type RFID sensor tag, it had the disadvantage of 
difficulty in the recycling of RFID sensor, as well as short recognition distance of RFID 
chip.  It  also  threatened  the  safety  of  consumer  through  its  loss  and  damage  inside  the 
body,  along  with  the  possibility  of  bodily  abnormality  occurrence  when  it  is  inserted 
inside the body. In the case of attachment type RFID sensor tag, there was a difficulty in 
accurately  sensing  inside  body  temperature  as  it  is  exposed  externally.  As  shown  in 
Figure 4, this ear insertion type module has alleviate the issues of existing temperature 
sensing by inserting it into livestock ear by inserting a rice grain size temperature sensor 
into polyurethane material module.

Abstract 

In recent, domestic livestock farms are receiving enormous damages through various 
livestock diseases that are highly contagious such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian 
influenza (AI). Additionally, they are experiencing difficulties also financially as a result 
of decrease in income from production cost increase. This paper will propose a livestock 
disease forecasting system for diagnosing in advance livestock disease status in real-time 
through  image  information  of  livestock  by  using  thermal  image  camera.  The  proposed 
system  can  extract  livestock  temperature  information  through  images  collected  from 
thermal image camera to diagnose in advance livestock disease status through Android-
based smart phone. Based on this, it is expected to contribute to the enhancement of the 
productivity  of  livestock  farms  and  their  competitiveness  by  minimizing  damages  from 
livestock disease by preventing disease damages in advance.

1. Introduction 

In  recent,  annual  domestic  meat  consumption  per  head  has  increased  by  more  than 
twofold  from  19.9kg  in  1990  to  43.5kg  in  2011,  thereby  occupying  significant 
percentages. However, domestic livestock industry is experiencing many difficulties as a 
result of increase in die rate from various livestock diseases and increase in production 
cost such as feed & energy costs [1]. 

Since 2000,  highly  contagious  diseases  have  been  occurring  such as foot-and-mouth 
disease and avian influenza. Accordingly, serious damages occurred in front back industry 
with about 3.4 million heads of livestock slaughter disposal and about 4 trillion won in 
damages [2, 4].

As shown in Table 1, number of foot-and-mouth slaughter disposal is shown compared 
to that in December 2010. The percentage of cow slaughter disposal from foot-and-mouth 
disease is about 5% with 150,000 heads among 2.9 million heads and the percentage of 
pig slaughter disposal is 33.6% with 3.3 million head among 10 million heads, thereby 
showing that damages of livestock farms are inevitable. To solve such issue, there is a 
need  for  technology  that  can  diagnose  in  advance  livestock  disease  and  increase 
production amount to enhance the competitiveness of domestic livestock industry [1, 3]. 

Although there are various methods of predicting livestock disease such as the method 
through livestock activity amount and the method of utilizing body insertion type sensor, 
it is difficult to check directly through visual inspection with a concern for causing issue 
in livestock safety [5, 6]. 

Accordingly,  a  disease  forecasting  system  using  thermal  image  came  is  proposed  in 
this paper. Thermal image camera is high reliable as it is being used in various areas such 
as healthcare, architecture design, etc. and it can solve safety issue through its non-contact 
type.  In  the  proposed  system,  server  that  extracts  and  manages  livestock  temperature 
information  from  images  collected  by  using  thermal  image  camera  comparatively 
analyzes the information with livestock disease determination standard value to diagnose 
in advance disease occurrence status, which is notified to Android-based smart phone user 
that  has  been  spread  widely  to  reduce  livestock  disease  damage  to  contribute  to  the 
productivity enhancement of livestock farms [5, 6]. 

The  composition  of  this  paper  is  as  follows.  Chapter  2  explains  the  composition 
diagram  and  flow  chart  of  Android-based  livestock  disease  forecasting  system  using 
thermal  image,  and  Chapter  3  analyzes  the  implementation  of  system.  Lastly,  the 
conclusion will present a future study direction and expected effect of this system through 
conclusion.

De Laval herd test management program attached with activity detection system 
drastically reduces breeding cost through reduced non-pregnant condition days and 
insemination  frequency  with  up  to  95%  of  rut  detection  performance.  The 
performance of activity detector can be estimated as it detects even slight rut signal 
of "silent rut". 

These  data  can  be  checked  through  De  Laval's  program  called  ALPRO  through 
which breeding calendar, smart breeding filter, breeding printout & rut alarm can be 
checked.  Based  on  activity  level,  it  automatically  predicts  breeding  and  detects 
disease and infection according to activity reduction and  activity amount for early

2.3. Livestock Disease Diagnosis Purpose Ear Insertion Type Module & Monitoring 
System (ETRI) 

This  system  that  has  been  developed  by  the  top  research  institution  of  our  country 
ETRI is a monitoring system to prevent the spread of disease through early identification 
of disease occurrence such as foot-and-mouth disease based on the temperature measured 
through reader or temperature transmitted periodically upon inserting RFID sensor chip 
that can measure livestock temperature into the ear of livestock [9]. 

In the case of existing body insertion type RFID sensor tag, it had the disadvantage of 
difficulty in the recycling of RFID sensor, as well as short recognition distance of RFID 
chip.  It  also  threatened  the  safety  of  consumer  through  its  loss  and  damage  inside  the 
body,  along  with  the  possibility  of  bodily  abnormality  occurrence  when  it  is  inserted 
inside the body. In the case of attachment type RFID sensor tag, there was a difficulty in 
accurately  sensing  inside  body  temperature  as  it  is  exposed  externally.  As  shown  in 
Figure 4, this ear insertion type module has alleviate the issues of existing temperature 
sensing by inserting it into livestock ear by inserting a rice grain size temperature sensor 
into polyurethane material module.

System using Thermal Image 

In outside environment, there are various environment sensors that collect environment 
information, CCTV that collects image information, thermal image camera and facilities 
for controlling livestock environment. The environment sensors are installed inside stall 
to collect environment information such as temperature, humidity and illumination sensor, 
and sensing information collected is transmitted to management server through sink node 
to measure environment change. Thermal image camera and CCTV that collect images 
are  installed  inside  stall  to  collect  images  in  real-time,  and  collected  images  are 
transmitted  to  management  server  through  DVR  to  extract  livestock  temperature

information  from  images.  Environment  facilities  control  consists  of  components  that 
influence  stall  environment  such  as  ventilator,  fan  heater  and  lighting  and  it  received 
control signal from management server to manage the status of stall facilities. 

The  management  server  consists  of  Sensor  Manager  for  managing  information 
collected  form  environment  sensor,  Image  Manager  for  managing  image  information 
collected from  CCTV  and  thermal  image  camera,  Facility  Manager for  controlling  and 
managing  stall  facilities,  Database  Server  for  storing  and  managing  stall  environment 
information and livestock temperature information and App Server that allows user to see 
environment information through Android-based smart phone. Sensor Manager conducts 
format  processing  into  format  that  can  be  stored  in  Database  for  the  stall  environment 
information collected from environment sensor and stores the information in Database by 
converting  it  into  unit  according  to  measurement  component.  Image  Manager  extracts 
livestock temperature information from images collected from CCTV and thermal image 
camera to store it in the format that can be stored in Database through format processing. 
Facility Manager plays the role of operating or managing stall facilities upon receiving 
control signal and storing such status of stall facilities in stall data. Database Server plays 
the role of storing data collected from environment sensor, image information collected 
from thermal image camera and CCTV stall facilities control data and status in each table. 
App Server plays the role of allowing user that uses Android-based smart phone to see 
and manage the environment information and image information stored in Database and 
transmitting the control signal sent by user to management server. 

User  plays  the  role  of  comparatively  analyzing  every  environment  data  collected  & 
facilities control service and livestock temperature information to notify livestock disease 
suspicion  status  through  Android-based  smart  phone  or  user  PC  in  the  case  of  falling 
short/exceeding standard value.

function  when  temperature  increases  to  higher  than  the  standard  value  set  in  Database 
Server as disease infection is expected in the livestock condition. 
 
5. Conclusion 

Livestock  diseases  that  occurred  domestically  in  recent  were  highly  contagious  and 
significant  damages  were  experienced  as  there  were  difficulties  in  early  response  and 
prevention of their spread.   

The  system  proposed  in  this  paper  used  non-contact  type  safe  thermal  image  to 
accurately measure the temperature of livestock to notify it to user through Android-based 
smart phone that can be used in real-time to predict disease. 

Based  on  this, livestock  farms  can  increase the  accuracy  of  disease  forecasting  than 
existing system for early response and prevent the concern for disease spread to minimize 
damages  from  disease  and  contribute  to  the  enhancement  of  productivity  and 
competitiveness.

inside the body. In the case of attachment type RFID sensor tag, there was a difficulty in 
accurately  sensing  inside  body  temperature  as  it  is  exposed  externally.  As  shown  in 
Figure 4, this ear insertion type module has alleviate the issues of existing temperature 
sensing by inserting it into livestock ear by inserting a rice grain size temperature sensor 
into polyurethane material module.

System using Thermal Image 

In outside environment, there are various environment sensors that collect environment 
information, CCTV that collects image information, thermal image camera and facilities 
for controlling livestock environment. The environment sensors are installed inside stall 
to collect environment information such as temperature, humidity and illumination sensor, 
and sensing information collected is transmitted to management server through sink node 
to measure environment change. Thermal image camera and CCTV that collect images 
are  installed  inside  stall  to  collect  images  in  real-time,  and  collected  images  are 
transmitted  to  management  server  through  DVR  to  extract  livestock  temperature

information  from  images.  Environment  facilities  control  consists  of  components  that 
influence  stall  environment  such  as  ventilator,  fan  heater  and  lighting  and  it  received 
control signal from management server to manage the status of stall facilities. 

The  management  server  consists  of  Sensor  Manager  for  managing  information 
collected  form  environment  sensor,  Image  Manager  for  managing  image  information 
collected from  CCTV  and  thermal  image  camera,  Facility  Manager for  controlling  and 
managing  stall  facilities,  Database  Server  for  storing  and  managing  stall  environment 
information and livestock temperature information and App Server that allows user to see 
environment information through Android-based smart phone. Sensor Manager conducts 
format  processing  into  format  that  can  be  stored  in  Database  for  the  stall  environment 
information collected from environment sensor and stores the information in Database by 
converting  it  into  unit  according  to  measurement  component.  Image  Manager  extracts 
livestock temperature information from images collected from CCTV and thermal image 
camera to store it in the format that can be stored in Database through format processing. 
Facility Manager plays the role of operating or managing stall facilities upon receiving 
control signal and storing such status of stall facilities in stall data. Database Server plays 
the role of storing data collected from environment sensor, image information collected 
from thermal image camera and CCTV stall facilities control data and status in each table. 
App Server plays the role of allowing user that uses Android-based smart phone to see 
and manage the environment information and image information stored in Database and 
transmitting the control signal sent by user to management server. 

User  plays  the  role  of  comparatively  analyzing  every  environment  data  collected  & 
facilities control service and livestock temperature information to notify livestock disease 
suspicion  status  through  Android-based  smart  phone  or  user  PC  in  the  case  of  falling 
short/exceeding standard value.

Android-based  thermal  image.  Using  thermal  image  camera  and  various  environment 
sensors, livestock temperature data and environment information data are collected and 
collected  data  are  transmitted  to  Sensor  Manager  and  Image  Manager.  The  transmitted 
data  information  is  converted  into  unit  according  to  measurement  component  through 
storable  format  processing  to  be  stored  in  Database,  and the stored data  information  is 
transmitted in real-time to management server. Received data information and livestock

temperature  standard  value  stored  in  Database  are  compared  and  when  the  result  falls 
short/exceeds, it notifies disease status to Android-based smart phone user, and maintains 
real-time monitoring when the result is within the scope of standard value. 
 
4. Implementation of Proposed System 

To test the application proposed in this paper, the application was tested by installing it 
in New Nexus 7, and Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) was used for the development environment of 
Android-based smart phone application and Android SDK 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) version was 
used for OS.

Figure 7 is the GUI screen of livestock disease forecasting system application using 
Android-based  thermal  image.  In  the  application,  image  information  collected  through 
thermal image camera and CCTV is shown in real-time through thermal image camera. 
Monitoring Data shows the data value of real-time environment information of inside the 
stall  in  graphs  per  time.  Average  Monitoring  Data  comparatively  analyzes  image 
information processed into format that can be stored in database and the stored standard 
value for display. Control Panel can control fan heather, ventilator and lighting as basic 
environment control to accurate identify disease occurrence status.

function  when  temperature  increases  to  higher  than  the  standard  value  set  in  Database 
Server as disease infection is expected in the livestock condition. 
 
5. Conclusion 

Livestock  diseases  that  occurred  domestically  in  recent  were  highly  contagious  and 
significant  damages  were  experienced  as  there  were  difficulties  in  early  response  and 
prevention of their spread.   

The  system  proposed  in  this  paper  used  non-contact  type  safe  thermal  image  to 
accurately measure the temperature of livestock to notify it to user through Android-based 
smart phone that can be used in real-time to predict disease. 

Based  on  this, livestock  farms  can  increase the  accuracy  of  disease  forecasting  than 
existing system for early response and prevent the concern for disease spread to minimize 
damages  from  disease  and  contribute  to  the  enhancement  of  productivity  and 
competitiveness.
