Home Appliance Control System (HACS) 
Home appliance control system is based on GSM network technology for transmission of SMS 
from sender to receiver. SMS sending and receiving is used for ubiquitous access of appliances 
and allowing breach control at home.  
The system proposes two sub-systems. Appliance control subsystem enables the user to control 
home appliances remotely whereas the security alert subsystem provides the remote security 
monitoring. The system is capable enough to instruct user via SMS from a specific cell number to 
change the condition of the home appliance according to the user’s needs and requirements. The 
second aspect is that of security alert which is achieved in a way that on the detection of intrusion 
the system allows automatic generation of SMS thus alerting the user against security risk. 
HACS system consists of the following components (shown in Figure 1):-

SMS Based Wireless Home Appliance Control System 

•  GSM hardware tests are run in order to check the hardware support. The system will 

call GSM modem and it will get activated. 

•  After activation the Modem will check for hardware support. If the hardware is missing 
or some other hardware problem there will be error, resulting in communication failure 
and the application will be terminated.  
If hardware responds then the serial port will  be opened for communication and GSM 
hardware will allow transmission of SMS. 

• 

•  The  system  will  then  connect  and  after  connection  establishment  the  system  will  be 
able  to  detect intrusion and will alert user about the breach and similarly the system 
will update status of appliances by receiving SMS from the pre-defined cell number. 

•  SMS will be silently ignored if cell number is unauthorized. 

Pseudo code 
The pseudo code for HACS is given as:- 

begin  

Run Tests 
If Test = 0 

Terminate program 

If Test = 1 

Communication = OK, port will open 
Click Connect 
Controls {Cj | j=1, 2, 3, 4} = enable 

If intrusion = 1 

Send security alert  

If incoming SMS = 1 

Simulate appliances 

end 

Characteristics of HACS 
The proposed system characteristics involve remote controlling of appliances, intrusion detection, 
system security and auto-configuration such that system automatically adjusts the system settings 
on running hardware support check. The system has useful features such as displaying of battery 
level, charging status and signal strength of the mobile thus making system reliable.  

Strengths of HACS 
HACS system has many advantages such as remote controlling of home appliances, availability 
and ease of users. The user can get alerts anywhere through the GSM technology thus making the 
system location independent. The system contains low cost components easily available which 
cuts down the overall system cost.  
Moreover system alerts user about breach via SMS providing home security also it allows secure 
access due to pre-configured number. The ease of deployment is due to wireless mode of com-
munication. GSM technology provides the benefit that the system is accessible in remote areas as 
well. The system reliability increases due to the useful features such as battery level checking, 
charging status and signal strength indicating the system about threats. The system integration is

Preliminaries 

Home Appliance Control System (HACS) 
Home appliance control system is based on GSM network technology for transmission of SMS 
from sender to receiver. SMS sending and receiving is used for ubiquitous access of appliances 
and allowing breach control at home.  
The system proposes two sub-systems. Appliance control subsystem enables the user to control 
home appliances remotely whereas the security alert subsystem provides the remote security 
monitoring. The system is capable enough to instruct user via SMS from a specific cell number to 
change the condition of the home appliance according to the user’s needs and requirements. The 
second aspect is that of security alert which is achieved in a way that on the detection of intrusion 
the system allows automatic generation of SMS thus alerting the user against security risk. 
HACS system consists of the following components (shown in Figure 1):-

Abstract 

This paper mainly focuses on the controlling of home appliances remotely and providing security 
when the user is away from the place. The system is SMS based and uses wireless technology to 
revolutionize the standards of living. This system provides ideal solution to the problems faced by 
home owners in daily life. The system is wireless therefore more adaptable and cost-effective. 
The HACS system provides security against intrusion as well as automates various home appli-
ances using SMS. The system uses GSM technology thus providing ubiquitous access to the sys-
tem for security and automated appliance control. 
Keywords: Short Message Service (SMS), Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), 
Radio Frequency (RF), AT Commands, ubiquitous access and Automation. 

Introduction 

The aim of the paper is to investigate a cost effective solution that will provide controlling of 
home appliances remotely and will also enable home security against intrusion in the absence of 
home owner. 
The motivation is to facilitate the users to automate their homes having ubiquitous access. The 
system provides availability due to development of a low cost system. The home appliances con-
trol system with an affordable cost was thought to be built that should be mobile providing re-
mote access to the appliances and allowing home security.  
Home security has been a major issue where crime is increasing and everybody wants to take 
proper measures to prevent intrusion. In addition there was a need to automate home so that user 
can take advantage of the technological advancement in such a way that a person getting off the 
office does not get melted with the hot climate. Therefore this paper proposes a system that al-
lows user to be control home appliances ubiquitously and also provide security on detection of 
intrusion via SMS using GSM technol-
ogy. 
The next section will explain the related 
work; section 3 explains the proposed 
system, methodology and algorithm. 
Section 4 discusses the framework, 
working, characteristics, strengths and 
constraints of the system. Section 5 ex-
plains the results and section 6 is con-
clusions and the future work.

auto enabling/disabling of certain features. 

Constraints of HACS 
The system functionality is based on GSM technology so the technological constraints must be 
kept in mind. The system is vulnerable to power failure but this disruption can be avoided by at-

Abstract 

This paper mainly focuses on the controlling of home appliances remotely and providing security 
when the user is away from the place. The system is SMS based and uses wireless technology to 
revolutionize the standards of living. This system provides ideal solution to the problems faced by 
home owners in daily life. The system is wireless therefore more adaptable and cost-effective. 
The HACS system provides security against intrusion as well as automates various home appli-
ances using SMS. The system uses GSM technology thus providing ubiquitous access to the sys-
tem for security and automated appliance control. 
Keywords: Short Message Service (SMS), Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), 
Radio Frequency (RF), AT Commands, ubiquitous access and Automation. 

Introduction 

The aim of the paper is to investigate a cost effective solution that will provide controlling of 
home appliances remotely and will also enable home security against intrusion in the absence of 
home owner. 
The motivation is to facilitate the users to automate their homes having ubiquitous access. The 
system provides availability due to development of a low cost system. The home appliances con-
trol system with an affordable cost was thought to be built that should be mobile providing re-
mote access to the appliances and allowing home security.  
Home security has been a major issue where crime is increasing and everybody wants to take 
proper measures to prevent intrusion. In addition there was a need to automate home so that user 
can take advantage of the technological advancement in such a way that a person getting off the 
office does not get melted with the hot climate. Therefore this paper proposes a system that al-
lows user to be control home appliances ubiquitously and also provide security on detection of 
intrusion via SMS using GSM technol-
ogy. 
The next section will explain the related 
work; section 3 explains the proposed 
system, methodology and algorithm. 
Section 4 discusses the framework, 
working, characteristics, strengths and 
constraints of the system. Section 5 ex-
plains the results and section 6 is con-
clusions and the future work.

Related Work 

Delgado, Picking, and Grout (2006) consider the problems with the implementation of home 
automation systems. Furthermore the possible solutions are devised through various network 
technologies. Several issues affecting home automation systems such as lack of robustness, com-
patibility issue and acceptability among the old and disabled people are discussed.  
Ciubotaru-Petrescu, Chiciudean, Cioarga, and Stanescu (2006) present a design and implementa-
tion of SMS based control for monitoring systems. The paper has three modules involving sens-
ing unit for monitoring the complex applications. A processing unit that is microcontroller and a 
communication module that uses GPRS modem or cell phone via serial port RS-232. The SMS is 
used for status reporting such as power failure. 
In their paper, Conte and Scaradozzi (2003) view home automation systems as multiple agent 
systems (MAS). In the paper home automation system has been proposed that includes home ap-
pliances and devices that are controlled and maintained for home management. The major task is 
to improve performance. 
In their paper, Alkar and Buhur (2005) propose an Internet Based Wireless Home Automation 
System for Multifunctional Devices. This paper proposes a low cost and flexible web-based solu-
tion but this system has some limitations such as the range and power failure.    
Murthy (2008) explores primary health-care management for the rural population. A solution 
proposes the use of the mobile web-technologies providing the PHC services to the rural popula-
tion. The system involves the use of SMS and cell phone technology for information manage-
ment, transactional exchange and personal communication. 
Jawarkar, Ahmed, Ladhake, and Thakare (2008) propose remote monitoring through mobile 
phone involving the use of spoken commands. The spoken commands are generated and sent in 
the form of text SMS to the control system and then the microcontroller on the basis of SMS 
takes a decision of a particular task.  
Potamitis, Georgila, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis, G. (2003) suggest the use of speech to interact 
remotely with the home appliances to perform a particular action on behalf of the user. The ap-
proach is inclined for people with disability to perform real-life operations at home by directing 
appliances through speech. Voice separation strategy is selected to take appropriate decision by 
speech recognition. 

Preliminaries 

Home Appliance Control System (HACS) 
Home appliance control system is based on GSM network technology for transmission of SMS 
from sender to receiver. SMS sending and receiving is used for ubiquitous access of appliances 
and allowing breach control at home.  
The system proposes two sub-systems. Appliance control subsystem enables the user to control 
home appliances remotely whereas the security alert subsystem provides the remote security 
monitoring. The system is capable enough to instruct user via SMS from a specific cell number to 
change the condition of the home appliance according to the user’s needs and requirements. The 
second aspect is that of security alert which is achieved in a way that on the detection of intrusion 
the system allows automatic generation of SMS thus alerting the user against security risk. 
HACS system consists of the following components (shown in Figure 1):-

PC: This unit contains the software components such as the HACS System through which the 
appliances are controlled and home security is monitored. 
GSM Modem: It is a hardware component that allows the capability to send and receive SMS to 
and from the system. The communication with the system takes place via RS232 serial port. Cell 
phone can be attached at the place of GSM hardware but it limits the hardware functionality such 
as sending or receiving of SMS. 
Mobile Device: Cellular phone containing SIM card has a specific number through which com-
munication takes place. The device communicates with the GSM Modem via radio frequency. 
Mobile user transmits SMS using GSM technology.

Working  
The working of HACS model (shown in Figure 1) is explained:- 
PC: PC being the main module has HACS system installed on it. The two subsystems; one being 
appliances control is responsible for ubiquitous access of appliances and the second subsystem 
being security alert is responsible for security intrusion detection. Both subsystems work on GSM 
technology for transmission of instructions from sender to receiver. 
GSM Modem: GSM modem is a plug and play device and is attached to the PC which then com-
municates with the PC via RS232 port. GSM modem is a bridge responsible for ena-
bling/disabling of SMS capability. 
Cell Phone: Mobile device communicates with the GSM Modem via radio waves. The mode of 
communication is wireless and mechanism works on the GSM technology. Cell phone has a SIM 
card and a GSM subscription. This cell phone number is configured on the system. User transmits 
instructions via SMS and the system takes action against those instructions.  

Methodology 
The methodology followed in the HACS is given as:- 

889 

SMS Based Wireless Home Appliance Control System 

•  GSM hardware tests are run in order to check the hardware support. The system will 

call GSM modem and it will get activated. 

•  After activation the Modem will check for hardware support. If the hardware is missing 
or some other hardware problem there will be error, resulting in communication failure 
and the application will be terminated.  
If hardware responds then the serial port will  be opened for communication and GSM 
hardware will allow transmission of SMS. 

• 

•  The  system  will  then  connect  and  after  connection  establishment  the  system  will  be 
able  to  detect intrusion and will alert user about the breach and similarly the system 
will update status of appliances by receiving SMS from the pre-defined cell number. 

•  SMS will be silently ignored if cell number is unauthorized. 

Pseudo code 
The pseudo code for HACS is given as:- 

begin  

Run Tests 
If Test = 0 

Terminate program 

If Test = 1 

Communication = OK, port will open 
Click Connect 
Controls {Cj | j=1, 2, 3, 4} = enable 

If intrusion = 1 

Send security alert  

If incoming SMS = 1 

Simulate appliances 

end 

Characteristics of HACS 
The proposed system characteristics involve remote controlling of appliances, intrusion detection, 
system security and auto-configuration such that system automatically adjusts the system settings 
on running hardware support check. The system has useful features such as displaying of battery 
level, charging status and signal strength of the mobile thus making system reliable.  

Strengths of HACS 
HACS system has many advantages such as remote controlling of home appliances, availability 
and ease of users. The user can get alerts anywhere through the GSM technology thus making the 
system location independent. The system contains low cost components easily available which 
cuts down the overall system cost.  
Moreover system alerts user about breach via SMS providing home security also it allows secure 
access due to pre-configured number. The ease of deployment is due to wireless mode of com-
munication. GSM technology provides the benefit that the system is accessible in remote areas as 
well. The system reliability increases due to the useful features such as battery level checking, 
charging status and signal strength indicating the system about threats. The system integration is 

890 

Khiyal, Khan, & Shehzadi 

simple and is also scalable and extensible. The auto-configuration capability allows the system 
auto enabling/disabling of certain features. 

Constraints of HACS 
The system functionality is based on GSM technology so the technological constraints must be 
kept in mind. The system is vulnerable to power failure but this disruption can be avoided by at-
taching the voltage source thus allowing users to avail the great advantage of this system. 

Results 

The results of the HACS system:- 
Figure 2 shows various GSM hardware tests that will be run to check the hardware support. 
The system then opens the serial port for communication with the GSM modem. On successful 
port opening the system communicates with the GSM Modem but if fails system does not com-
municate. 
The system checks support for battery level, signal strength and GSM modem SMS sending and 
receiving capability. If these tests succeed the system gives response of ‘Ok’, if not then ‘ER-
ROR’ is returned.
