ABSTRACT 
With the advancement of the crime rate security is having its 
alarming  significance  for  school  children’s.  The  safety 
mechanism  to  the  transportation  bus  and  to  the  children 
travelling from home to the school and resume back to home 
is  a  standalone  component  to  the  parents  and  to  the  school 
management.  This paper aims to provide the total security for 
school  children.  Range  and  Obstacle  detection  and  accident 
detected sensors are implanted on the front surface of the bus 
in  order  to  avoid  collision  with  another  vehicle  on  the  Road. 
Each  student  is  tagged  with  unique  code.  Two  counters  used 
at  the  entrance  and  exit  location  of  the  bus.  Wireless 
communication technology (IEEE 802.4.15) is used to inform 
the  status  of  the  bus  to  the  school  principal.  The  absentee 
record  of  the  student  will  be  send  to  the  concerned  parent 
before leaving the children entry point. The return information 
is  also  informed  to  the  parent  using  GSM  technology.    The 
results  are  favorably  good  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the 
security issues.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
School  children  safety  is  the  most  significant  component 
encouraged to precede research with the support of advanced 
technology.    Several  bitter  incidents  forced  to  develop  an 
innovative  methodology  to  provide  secure  life  for  children. 
Parents are unable to feel comfortable until the child resumed 
back  to  home  safely.  Missing  of  the  students  at  school 
premises,  anti  social  elements  kidnappings  etc  are  increasing 
in an advance. Technology should be imperative to safe guard

device  i.e  IEEE  802.15.4  Fig  3.6  shows  the  switching 
mechanism to drive the school bus. 

3.6  Theoretical Calculations 
For  stable  movement  of  the  school bus  the  required  spinning 
force of the  motor is calculated. Four DC motors are used to 
drive  the  school  bus.  Four  driving  switches  are  used  to 
position  the  bus  forward,  left,  right  and  stop  positions.    The 
driving signals from the input switches are given as inputs to 
the  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller  will  drive  the  motor 
driving  circuitry  (L293D)  to  enable  the  motion  of  the  school 
bus. The torque required to drive the bus is proportional to its 
weight.   
The measured weight of the School bus is 98.06650 Newton, 
and the shaft length is 0.03 meters.  
Torque required = Force * Distance =98.06650 *0.03= 2.9419 
Newton –Meters. 

3.6.1 For School bus linear motion  
The  power  [watts]  =  Force  [Newton]  *  velocity  [Meter/ 
Second]  
The calculated required power = 98.06650* 0.1 = 9.80 watts.  
The motor shaft angular motion is to be estimated .i.e  
The angular velocity of motor under no load is 100 RPM.  
The product of torque and the rotational distance per unit time 
is equated with power.  
Prot = M* W  
Where Prot = Rotational mechanical power  
M= Torque  
W= Angular velocity  
Angular velocity Wrad /sec = 100 * [ 2*Π / 60 ] = 10.46 rad / 
sec  
Power  required  to  drive  a  torque  load  of  2.9419  Newton  / 
meter  
= Torque Load* 100 rpm * conversion factor  
= 2.9419 *100 * 0.1047= 30.8016 Watts  
Rotational mechanical power P rot =30.8016 Watts  
Output shaft torque M = 2.9419 
Motor current estimated (I) = M /K  
Where K is torque constant = 1.22 NM/A  
The resistance (R) of the motor = 3.3 Ohms  
Drive voltage U = R*I + K* W  
Where w is Angular velocity  
Motor current I = 0.57 A  
Estimated Drive Voltage = 14.64 V dc  
Rated voltage = 15 V dc

communication technology (IEEE 802.4.15) is used to inform 
the  status  of  the  bus  to  the  school  principal.  The  absentee 
record  of  the  student  will  be  send  to  the  concerned  parent 
before leaving the children entry point. The return information 
is  also  informed  to  the  parent  using  GSM  technology.    The 
results  are  favorably  good  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the 
security issues.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
School  children  safety  is  the  most  significant  component 
encouraged to precede research with the support of advanced 
technology.    Several  bitter  incidents  forced  to  develop  an 
innovative  methodology  to  provide  secure  life  for  children. 
Parents are unable to feel comfortable until the child resumed 
back  to  home  safely.  Missing  of  the  students  at  school 
premises,  anti  social  elements  kidnappings  etc  are  increasing 
in an advance. Technology should be imperative to safe guard 
the society.  The developed working model considered RF ID 
Technology  and  an  advanced  ARM  7  processor  and  GSM 
technology. The status of the children is readily available with 
the  school  principal  and  with  the  parent  time  to  time.  The 
return status of the child is secured by providing the message 
to the parent in advance is encouraged to meet the challenges 
in the children security. The working model is developed and

DESCRIPTION 
3.1  Range detection and obstacle detection 
device 
The  Module  consists  of  transmitter  and  receiver.  The  device 
will sense the object span of 0.02 to 4 meters. 
10  Micro  sec  triggering  pulse  is  applied  to  start  the  ranging.  
The  module  releases  40  kHz  ultrasound  for  eight  successive 
cycles. Then the echo line goes high. Any object in the line of 
sight  the device  listen  the  echo  and  lowers  its  echo  line.  The 
width of the pulse is proportional to the distance of the object. 
if no object is detected the echo line is pulsed low after 30 m 
sec.  
The range of the object in inches = width of the pulse / 148   
The device is able to trigger  for every 50 micro seconds. So, 
the  device  can  scan  for  objet  20  times  in  a  second.  If  any 
object  is  detected  against  the  bus  the  output  signal  of  the 
micro  controller  causes  to  regulate  the  speed  of  the  bus.  The 
collision can be curtailed to the maximum extent. 
3.2  Vibration sensor 
A  vibration  sensor  is  positioned  in  the  bus  to  detect  the 
collision  with  another  vehicle  on  the  bus.  Any  accident  may 
causes to deviate the neutral axis of the piezo electric crystal. 
The output signal across the axis of the piezo electric cryptal 
is measured in terms of voltage. Total indicator reading (TIR) 
is  used  to  determine  the  total  vibration  number.  i.e  The 
difference  between  the  maximum  positive  and  negative 
amplitude  of  the  signal  is  used  to  determine  the  total 
vibration. This signal is interfaced to ARM 7 microcontroller. 
The processed signal is transmitted to the school principal and

Fig  3.5  ARM  7  interfaced  to  the  Wireless  communication 
device  i.e  IEEE  802.15.4  Fig  3.6  shows  the  switching 
mechanism to drive the school bus. 

3.6  Theoretical Calculations 
For  stable  movement  of  the  school bus  the  required  spinning 
force of the  motor is calculated. Four DC motors are used to 
drive  the  school  bus.  Four  driving  switches  are  used  to 
position  the  bus  forward,  left,  right  and  stop  positions.    The 
driving signals from the input switches are given as inputs to 
the  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller  will  drive  the  motor 
driving  circuitry  (L293D)  to  enable  the  motion  of  the  school 
bus. The torque required to drive the bus is proportional to its 
weight.   
The measured weight of the School bus is 98.06650 Newton, 
and the shaft length is 0.03 meters.  
Torque required = Force * Distance =98.06650 *0.03= 2.9419 
Newton –Meters. 

3.6.1 For School bus linear motion  
The  power  [watts]  =  Force  [Newton]  *  velocity  [Meter/ 
Second]  
The calculated required power = 98.06650* 0.1 = 9.80 watts.  
The motor shaft angular motion is to be estimated .i.e  
The angular velocity of motor under no load is 100 RPM.  
The product of torque and the rotational distance per unit time 
is equated with power.  
Prot = M* W  
Where Prot = Rotational mechanical power  
M= Torque  
W= Angular velocity  
Angular velocity Wrad /sec = 100 * [ 2*Π / 60 ] = 10.46 rad / 
sec  
Power  required  to  drive  a  torque  load  of  2.9419  Newton  / 
meter  
= Torque Load* 100 rpm * conversion factor  
= 2.9419 *100 * 0.1047= 30.8016 Watts  
Rotational mechanical power P rot =30.8016 Watts  
Output shaft torque M = 2.9419 
Motor current estimated (I) = M /K  
Where K is torque constant = 1.22 NM/A  
The resistance (R) of the motor = 3.3 Ohms  
Drive voltage U = R*I + K* W  
Where w is Angular velocity  
Motor current I = 0.57 A  
Estimated Drive Voltage = 14.64 V dc  
Rated voltage = 15 V dc

3.3  RFID Reader 

3.4  Communications 
Global  system  for  mobile  communication  (GSM)  is  adopted 
to  communicate  with  the  parents  and  to  the  school principal. 
The  mode  of  data  transmission  is  through  SMS  only.  The 
microcontroller  will  communicate  with  the  GSM  modem 
serially via MAX 232 line driver. The MAX 232 will convert 
TTL logic levels to Serial logic levels.

indentifying  information  stored  in  the  microchip  transmits  to 
the RFID reader using an antenna. RFID reader is equipped  
at  the  entrance  and  exit  gate  of  the  bus.  The  reader  will 
communicate to the  ARM7  microcontroller serially using the

ARM 7 micro controller is used to process the acquired input 
signals.  UP  counter  is  required  to  record  the  number  of 
students occupied in the bus and to send the status information 
to the concerned authorities.  The down counter is required to 
empty  the  bus  with  children.  The  speed  of  processing  is 
obtained  with  128-bit  interface  /  accelerator.  Multiple  serial

interfaces  are  supporting  to  meet  the  demand  of  the  work, 
RFID reader to Micro controller and microcontroller to GSM. 
Fig  3.5  ARM  7  interfaced  to  the  Wireless  communication 
device  i.e  IEEE  802.15.4  Fig  3.6  shows  the  switching 
mechanism to drive the school bus. 

3.6  Theoretical Calculations 
For  stable  movement  of  the  school bus  the  required  spinning 
force of the  motor is calculated. Four DC motors are used to 
drive  the  school  bus.  Four  driving  switches  are  used  to 
position  the  bus  forward,  left,  right  and  stop  positions.    The 
driving signals from the input switches are given as inputs to 
the  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller  will  drive  the  motor 
driving  circuitry  (L293D)  to  enable  the  motion  of  the  school 
bus. The torque required to drive the bus is proportional to its 
weight.   
The measured weight of the School bus is 98.06650 Newton, 
and the shaft length is 0.03 meters.  
Torque required = Force * Distance =98.06650 *0.03= 2.9419 
Newton –Meters. 

3.6.1 For School bus linear motion  
The  power  [watts]  =  Force  [Newton]  *  velocity  [Meter/ 
Second]  
The calculated required power = 98.06650* 0.1 = 9.80 watts.  
The motor shaft angular motion is to be estimated .i.e  
The angular velocity of motor under no load is 100 RPM.  
The product of torque and the rotational distance per unit time 
is equated with power.  
Prot = M* W  
Where Prot = Rotational mechanical power  
M= Torque  
W= Angular velocity  
Angular velocity Wrad /sec = 100 * [ 2*Π / 60 ] = 10.46 rad / 
sec  
Power  required  to  drive  a  torque  load  of  2.9419  Newton  / 
meter  
= Torque Load* 100 rpm * conversion factor  
= 2.9419 *100 * 0.1047= 30.8016 Watts  
Rotational mechanical power P rot =30.8016 Watts  
Output shaft torque M = 2.9419 
Motor current estimated (I) = M /K  
Where K is torque constant = 1.22 NM/A  
The resistance (R) of the motor = 3.3 Ohms  
Drive voltage U = R*I + K* W  
Where w is Angular velocity  
Motor current I = 0.57 A  
Estimated Drive Voltage = 14.64 V dc  
Rated voltage = 15 V dc

Step 4: Enabling the bus driving mechanism   
Step 5 : Read the RFID reader at stage 2 

 
 

If the tag found then increment the counter  
Else  
Send the message “your child is absent” to parent 
Repeat step 3 to 4 for next two stops 

Step 6: Check the destination point  
 
 

Verify the counter  
If the count =0 
Then  send  the  message  “route  no”-“bus  no  –“,

5.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
Fig 5.1, Fig 5.2, Fig 5.3 represents the positions of the bus at 
various stop points. Fig 5.4 represents the status of bus to the 
school  principal.  If  any  student  entry  at  particular  location  is 
not  detected  the  absent  status  is  send  as  an  SMS  to  the 
concerned parent. Fig 5.5 shows the absent information sends 
to  the  parent.  Fig  5.6  represents  the  status  of  the  student’s 
entry to the school premises. Fig.5.7 represents the destination 
arriving  status  of  the  student is  send  to  the  right parent.  This 
developed methodology is also providing station enouncement 
in  a  loud  voice.  The  results  obtained  are  favorably  good  to 
meet the expectations of the school children security.
