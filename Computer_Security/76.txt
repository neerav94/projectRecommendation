I.  INTRODUCTION 

Time has become an important factor of human’s life. Most of 
the  students  travel  through  school  bus.  Parents  have  to  leave 
their children to the pick and drop point of school bus. Most of 
the time parents have to wait at the spot much before arrival of 
school bus. Parents are always in confusion of location of bus. 
Same confusion faced by them about the bus route.  
There are many more private transporters who work for school 
bus. Sometimes driver can change the route of bus to sexually 
abuse  child  in  bus  after  school  timings.  Such  condition  puts 
finger  on  safety  of  child  in  school  bus.  Parents  need  such  a 
device  which  identifies  drivers  identity,  location  of  child, 
status  of  the  bus  (Pick  or  Drop),  and  route  of  bus  during 
travels.  Some  of  such  devices  exist  in  market  which  fulfills 
some  of  the  requirement.  Such  system  has  some  flaws  and 
limitation.  The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  eliminate  flaws  and 
limitation  in  existing  system  and  add  better  advancement  in 
the device. 
There  are  many  devices  which  gives  GPS  location  of  a 
vehicle.  This  GPS  location  is  sent  through  SMS  or  Internet. 
Most  of  the  time,  combined  communication  modem  having 
GPS  and  GPRS  facility  is  used.  For  person  identification 
Biometrics module is used. By using this equipment a system 
can  be  built  which  satisfies  parents  need  in  day  today  life.  A 
driver  can  register  his  identity  online  through  biometrics.

Error  message.  Once  hardware  is  ok  then  system  asks  for 
driver login. For diver login driver have to type 11 digit driver 
unique  ID.  And  his  fingerprint  needed  to  add.  Once  driver  is 
get login the data is verified through server. Now onwards for 
system  login  driver  only  need  to  pace  finger  on  biometrics 
module  and  enter  school  ID  for  system  login.  System  get

This microcontroller has less RAM round 40 Byte. 40 byte of 
RAM  is  not  sufficient  to  run  complex  program.  Because  of 
less  RAM  no  RTOS  can  run  on  this  controller.  The  second 
limitation is number of ports available. Also this controller has 
only one UART available. So for interfacing biometrics sensor 
and GPRS device need multiplexer IC in existing System.
