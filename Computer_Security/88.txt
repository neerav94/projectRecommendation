Introduction

1
Wireless security work has largely focused on authenti-
cation and key exchange, and using the resulting security
association for encryption and integrity protection of indi-
vidual packets. Authorization has often been considered
something that “just happens” at some step, and when au-
thorization is explicitly considered, it is often simpliﬁed to
sending an authenticated identity and other parameters to
a “policy black box” and receiving a yes/no answer back.
We think this picture of authorization is both misleading
and insufﬁcient. In this extended abstract, we focus on the
role of authorization in public wireless networks. We ﬁrst
illustrate some problems, then discuss the relationship of
authorization to, e.g., handoffs and accounting, and ﬁnally
sketch some ideas about how these issues could be better
handled in future protocols.

2 Challenges
2.1 Business aspects
Our ﬁrst observation is that enforcing policies that are
mainly about money (“anyone who pays is allowed”) is
different from enforcing policies about authenticated iden-
tities (“anyone in the RD_Employees group is allowed ac-
cess”). Much of this difﬁculty comes from having multiple
players and many different business models.

For instance, getting WLAN access might involve not
only the client and the AP, but local access network or
WISP, a mediating network or a roaming broker, a home
ISP, and an enterprise buying the service from the home
ISP on behalf of its employees. And these are only for
authorization—actually routing the user’s IP packets is a
separate issue.

Another aspect is that different business models are
used. Traditional subscription-based access with postpaid
billing is the case often considered, but even, e.g., pre-
paid is already quite different. And then we get things like
credit card payment, buying an access code printed on pa-
per from the coffee shop counter, or paying for the access

Practically any protocol includes some usually unstated
assumptions about the players and their business models
in its design, and new uses often stretch the limits. Even
common messages take somewhat different semantics de-
pending on the situation. For instance, within a single ISP
a RADIUS Access-Accept message could mean “yes, give
access”, while in roaming case it might be better inter-
preted “yes, I agree to pay you the costs of this session
according to our contract”.

To take an another example, as the result of the “au-
thentication and key exchange” phase, the local WISP or
its access points do not necessarily know any authenticated
identiﬁer for the client.

2.2 Modular decomposition of protocols

Multi-party systems are often speciﬁed as sets of two-
party protocols, each of which tries to be as independent
as possible from the others. This simpliﬁes speciﬁcation
and gives some ﬂexibility, but the boundaries between the
protocols can also lead to difﬁculties.

For instance, the “802.11i/EAP/RADIUS system” does
not authenticate any identiﬁer of the access point to the
client. This is perhaps not too surprising, given the roots of
EAP and RADIUS in the dial-up world—and that there is
not even any good name for the protocol of which 802.11i,
EAP and RADIUS are sub-protocols of!

Protocol boundaries also restrict what can be done. For
instance, current WLANs do not have any protocol or
communication channel for exchanging authorization re-
lated information between the client and the AAA proxies.
Current experience suggests that such a channel would
be useful for many purposes, including retrieving infor-
mation about the access network (not necessarily about a
single AP), its relationships with roaming brokers, and the
services it provides before fully authenticating to the net-
work [2, 3]. This information would be useful for, e.g.,
deciding which access network to use, which credentials
to use, and whether a handoff might be possible.

Since there is no proper channel to use, people have re-
sorted to tricks like using non-integrity-protected ﬁelds in
EAP, and using EAP for other purposes than authenticat-
ing the client, such as passing network information from

Multi-party systems are often speciﬁed as sets of two-
party protocols, each of which tries to be as independent
as possible from the others. This simpliﬁes speciﬁcation
and gives some ﬂexibility, but the boundaries between the
protocols can also lead to difﬁculties.

For instance, the “802.11i/EAP/RADIUS system” does
not authenticate any identiﬁer of the access point to the
client. This is perhaps not too surprising, given the roots of
EAP and RADIUS in the dial-up world—and that there is

lated information between the client and the AAA proxies.

be useful for many purposes, including retrieving infor-
mation about the access network (not necessarily about a

services it provides before fully authenticating to the net-
work [2, 3]. This information would be useful for, e.g.,
deciding which access network to use, which credentials
to use, and whether a handoff might be possible.

Since there is no proper channel to use, people have re-
sorted to tricks like using non-integrity-protected ﬁelds in
EAP, and using EAP for other purposes than authenticat-
ing the client, such as passing network information from

AAA proxies to the client using a proprietary EAP method
(iPass, Microsoft’s WPS).

2.3 Fast handoffs
Authorization is also related to fast handoffs (in this ab-
stract, meaning handoffs not involving the home AAA
server). In particular, the handoff can succeed only if the
new AP is covered by the home network’s “promise to
pay”, and in inter-operator case, the new AP accepts the
promises of this home network. Currently what exactly
is covered by the implicit promise in RADIUS Access-
Accept is not explicitly deﬁned; and neither is this infor-
mation communicated to the client.

Communicating this scope explicitly is not without
problems, though: it limits the types of policies that can be
used by the home network, since the policy has to be inter-
preted at the access network, and thus represented in the
protocol used between them (such as RADIUS). A sim-
ple, if unrealistic, example would be allowing a user to
access only APs whose MAC address is even. If technical
advances increase the potential scope of handoffs, more
realistic policies can also cause problems: for instance,
limiting a user to a particular geographic location, access
technology, or service usage restrictions. [1]

Handoffs also complicate the issue of authorization and
session related state in the network. For instance, session
termination initiated by the home network requires keep-
ing track of where the client is. A naive implementation
might lead to “chasing the ﬂy around the room” type of
situation: the client moves around to avoid disconnection.

2.4 Accounting
Another type of authorization state held at the network
is related to accounting. Traditional postpaid, where the
accounting records are processed in batches later, can be
often considered separately from authorization during the
session, but, e.g., prepaid ties these two together.

Depending on the circumstances, prepaid balance reser-
vations may be handled by a separate AAA proxy in the
network. In this case, either the scope of fast handoffs is
limited by the scope of this proxy, or fast handoff signaling
also needs to move the state to the new AAA proxy.

Many existing systems also lack a channel for commu-
nication accounting-related information to the client: e.g.,
showing the user the cost of the service, or redirecting the
user to a web page for recharging his or her prepaid ac-
count (but without dirty “browser hijack” tricks).

3 Conclusions: Sketching a solution
This is work in progress, and we have not considered yet
the details of how the proposal would be implemented in,
e.g., 802.11 networks or some future networking technol-
ogy. However, we have identiﬁed some issues that we feel

should be taken into account.

Allow reuse of existing user databases and creden-
tials—One of the few issues EAP got right, even though in
some circles the common wisdom seems to be, amazingly
enough, exactly the opposite: each protocol should use its
own credentials.

Avoid hardcoding business models and policies into
protocols—This cannot be totally avoided, but keep things
ﬂexible (e.g., EAP/802.11i makes credit card payments
difﬁcult).

Do not design components in a vacuum—While modu-
lar decomposition is important, it is as important to get the
decomposition right. Especially the multi-party nature of
the problem should be taken into account. Also, keeping
security totally separate from the protocol that does the
real work (setting up wireless connectivity between sys-
tems) is not a good idea: create a protocol for doing the
work securely instead (cf. 802.11/11i relationship).

Make the entities involved ﬁrst class citizens—The en-
tities need to be named; that is, given identiﬁers that can
be used as intended destination of messages, and can be
mentioned in messages sent to some third entity.

The identiﬁers are not necessarily long-term or human
readable. Using identiﬁers that can be authenticated with-
out any infrastructure, in practice meaning hashes of pub-
lic keys, may simplify the architecture by decoupling user
interface issues (e.g., two entities can agree that they are
talking to the same third party without knowing a human
readable identiﬁer for it), and solving issues such as “MAC
address ownership”

Provide proper communication channels between the
entities—Entities involved in authorization should be able
to communicate both prior, during, and after network at-
tachment. The communication channels should be secure
and support efﬁcient multiplexing of different messages.

Be explicit—Explicitly communicate properties and ex-
pectations about other parties’ actions. For instance, iden-
tities of the involved parties (not just the client and AP),
their capabilities, and policies that other entities are ex-
pected to follow.

Consider authorization state in handoffs—Some kind
of signaling that involves other entities than old and new
AP, such as a local AAA proxy, may be needed for proper
authorization, either during or after the handoff.
