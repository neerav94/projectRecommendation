      Abstract—  The  revolution  of  Mobile  and  Technology  has 
made ‘GSM based car security system’ .The car security system 
is  prominent  worldwide.  But  it  is  not  so  much  secure  system. 
Every  car  owner  wants  maximum  protection  of  his  car; 
otherwise thief can easily trap the car. So, by combing the idea of 
mobile and car security system I m talking about GSM based car 
security system. Aim of the   project is to try the save the car. The 
name project itself suggests that it is based on GSM. So this GSM 
based  car  security  system  is  works  when  someone  try  to  steal 
your car immediately this security system be alert and send sms 
on your mobile through GSM modem and buzzer will also make 
sound ,so you getting the information immediately  and  you can 
save    your  car.  In  this  system  it  sense  five  parameters  for 
security:

 Sometimes also happen that we  get  information  about 
car’s  trapping  but  we  are  unable  to  reach  there  or  can’t 
inform to other to save our car. 
C. General Working of GSM Based Car Security System 

Put system in working mode (make system on). 
After  that  ‘HELLO’  will  print  on  the  LCD  that  means 

system is now ready to work. 

This system detects five parameters: Any of the front doors 
open, Vibration occurs, Revolution happen, Optical detected 
if  any  one  seat  in  the  car  on  driving  seat  and  battery  got 
ignition. 

If any one of these parameters is detected the system will 
generate alarm means buzzer will sound and at a time this 
GSM  based  car  security  system  will  send  the  sms  through 
GSM modem. 

So when we get sms on that time we may anywhere but we 

can try to save our own car.  

In  sms  we  get  the  information  not  only  about  the  one 
the 

is  detected,  but  remaining  all 

parameter  which 
parameters status information also we get. 
D. Applications: 

 Car  security  system  finds  many  applications  in  this 

modern world.  

 It is useful in all type of security system. 
 Like in any vehicles tracking system –scooter, car, bike, 

etc. 

 In is also use full in Bank security. 
 It  means  it  is  useful  in  everywhere  .Whenever  you 
implement  by  changing  some  of 

require  you  can 
programming and function according to your requirement  

 Simple security system is used to save important items. 
In  place  of  simple  security  system  we  can  implement  this 
GSM  based  security.  So  that  we  get  sms  immediate  when 
ever system disturb and alarm will also generate. So it is use 
full in every type of security system and we can make more 
secure our things.

Fig: 4 Out-put window for Micro-IDE 

When  we  are  compile  successfully  on  that  time  we  are 

getting this type of window (shown as above). 
A. Advantages: 
It  goes  without  saying  that  the  use  of  GSM  BASED  CAR 
SECURITY SYSTEM encourages the used of latest wireless 
technology, hence in India it is not known so much. Besides, 
they also have the following additional benefits:  
Improved Security: From this system we can try to save our 
car by anywhere we are in this global world. As this system 
gives  us  the  information  about  the  our  car’s  front  doors 
(open/close), anyone on the font sit, any type of vibration on 
the  car,  anyone  try  to  start  the  car  and  anyone  take  car  by 
pushing or revolving. If anything is happened we can get the 
information  about  all  parameters 
including  detected 
parameter. So this system is more advanced and useful than 
the  simple  car  security  system  which  available  in  today’s 
Indian market. 
Better Customer  Service: Here wet better service  plus  also 
benefited with cost wise because its cost is very less compared 
to car cost.  
B. Disadvantages: 

 We can’t save our car if our mobile is not  in  working 

condition anyhow. 

 If car’s owner’s mobile is out off coverage area on that 

time also we can’t save the car. 

 for simulation we are using MICRO IDE SOFTWARE

II.  MICRO-IDE COMPILER 

Micro-IDE  is  a  Windows-based  Integrated  Development 
Environment for micro-controller application development. 
Micro-IDE  integrates  essential  components  of  software 
development including:  

 Multi File Editor with C, Basic and Assembly language 

syntax coloring.

 Sometimes also happen that we  get  information  about 
car’s  trapping  but  we  are  unable  to  reach  there  or  can’t 
inform to other to save our car. 
C. General Working of GSM Based Car Security System 

Put system in working mode (make system on). 
After  that  ‘HELLO’  will  print  on  the  LCD  that  means 

system is now ready to work. 

This system detects five parameters: Any of the front doors 
open, Vibration occurs, Revolution happen, Optical detected 
if  any  one  seat  in  the  car  on  driving  seat  and  battery  got 
ignition. 

If any one of these parameters is detected the system will 
generate alarm means buzzer will sound and at a time this 
GSM  based  car  security  system  will  send  the  sms  through 
GSM modem. 

So when we get sms on that time we may anywhere but we 

can try to save our own car.  

In  sms  we  get  the  information  not  only  about  the  one 
the 

is  detected,  but  remaining  all 

parameter  which 
parameters status information also we get. 
D. Applications: 

 Car  security  system  finds  many  applications  in  this 

modern world.  

 It is useful in all type of security system. 
 Like in any vehicles tracking system –scooter, car, bike, 

etc. 

 In is also use full in Bank security. 
 It  means  it  is  useful  in  everywhere  .Whenever  you 
implement  by  changing  some  of 

require  you  can 
programming and function according to your requirement  

 Simple security system is used to save important items. 
In  place  of  simple  security  system  we  can  implement  this 
GSM  based  security.  So  that  we  get  sms  immediate  when 
ever system disturb and alarm will also generate. So it is use 
full in every type of security system and we can make more 
secure our things.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT 

This  is  the  great  opportunity  to  get  paper  prationtation  for 
doing and from stating of project undertaking this was a great 
Learning Experience. I certainly encountered difficulties at 
various stages of implementation. However, by challenging 
and  achievement 
that  filled  us  so  completely  after 
overcoming  all  the  awe-inspiring  odds  is  inexplicable  in 
words. The unending guidance, inspiration and support that 
we  received  from  various  quarters  are  truly  what  actually 
kept me going. With deep sense of gratefulness, I hereby take 
this opportunity to give my genuine and hearty thanks to all 
the people who helped me realize this. 
   First and foremost I would like to extend my appreciation 
to  the  HOD  of  the  E&C  Department,  P.I.E.T,  Limda  – 
Prof.  A.R  Yadav,  for  providing  us  with  this  excellent 
opportunity 
the  necessary 
Industrial experience. and, last but not the least; let us thank 
all  the  teachers  and  the  technical  staff  members  of  our 
college for encouraging and keeping my spirits high during 
the entire session of this project. 
  Also, I would to thank all those who directly or indirectly 
helped me in preparing the project. and also, I would like to 
expand  my  love  and  gratefulness  to  my  Parents.  Without 
whom it is not possible to be here.
