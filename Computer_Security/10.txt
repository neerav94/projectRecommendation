3. Proposed System Implementation 

In previous Overview passage, the overall system is classified into three sections, these 

are 1. Input Section, 2. Processing Section and 3. Output section. 

 

3.1. Input Section 

Input section consists of two unit, one is “Image processing technology” and another is 

“Voice synthesis technology”. 

3.1.1.  Overview  of  Image  Processing  Technology:  From  some  previous  decades, 
image  processing  has  been  taken  an  advisable  interest  as  bioinformatics  research.  A 
number  of  studies  in  previous  on  image  processing  and  image  computational  technique 
have been done mentioned in [6-14]. In this paper, for building face recognition system in 
order to get proper security of the proposed model was done using the 2D-DCT algorithm. 
The  proposed  model  has  been  effectively  implemented  by  taking  a  great  help  from  the 
works  in  [15-17].  In  this  project,  “Matlab  Image  Acquisition  Tool”  and  “Matlab  Image 
Processing  Tool”  are  used  as  image  processing  technology.  “Matlab  Image  Processing 
Tool” has a verse application on the field of image processing. The front view of “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Toolbar” is given in Figure 4 at the moment of capturing an image to 
save it as authorized file for the system. 
 

Figure 4.Font View of Image Acquisition Toolbox 

 

Before  starting  acquisition  of  an  image,  we  set  acquisition  parameters  –data  type  as 
uint 8 bit and memory allocation to disk shown in Figure 5.aImage processing unit starts it 
action  by  acquitting  an  image  and  export  it  to  MATLAB  Workspace  of  a  valid  format 
similar of “file_name.mat”. In Workspace exported file is automatically converted to uint 
8, digital data with a specific bytes size is shown in Figure 5.b.

send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary

against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and

1. Introduction  

An outlying home security, supervision and protection system have become more and 
more  desirable  with  the  progress  of  IT  technology,  network  and  automatic  control 
technology  now-a-days.  Wireless  sensor  network  (WSN)  and  global  system  for  mobile 
communication  (GSM)  technology  provide  a  better  design  and  development  of  remote 
home  security  and  supervene  system  whose  main  goal  is  to  identify  theft,  fire  etc.,  and 
send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary 
judgment  of  home  safety  [2].  The  need  of  security  system  is  essential  to  make  safety 
against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and 
power consumer.

In  this  paper,  we  design  a  security  system  which  gives  remotely  security  against 
intrusion.  Our  work  presents,  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  smart  security  token 
system  consisting  of  two  technologies.  We  use  web-cam  or  CCTV  to  capture  images 
along a prescribed direction as first technology. The direction of capturing image will be 
controlled  remotely  using  GSM/GPRS  technology  and  send  image  equivalent  digital 
signal to the house owner’s mobile or mailing address. Voice synthesis is used as second 
technology  in  this  system  in  order  to  record  a  voice  and  check  the  current  record  voice 
with the voices which are validated previously through this system.

processing section. It acts as project processor which takes input from image processing 
unit and sound recording unit through UART RS-232 protocol and provides output to i.

opened or not iii. Light alarm circuitry whether it indicates “Green” or “Red”. The overall 
system implementation probable view is given in Figure 1.

1. Introduction  

An outlying home security, supervision and protection system have become more and 
more  desirable  with  the  progress  of  IT  technology,  network  and  automatic  control 
technology  now-a-days.  Wireless  sensor  network  (WSN)  and  global  system  for  mobile 
communication  (GSM)  technology  provide  a  better  design  and  development  of  remote 
home  security  and  supervene  system  whose  main  goal  is  to  identify  theft,  fire  etc.,  and 
send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary 
judgment  of  home  safety  [2].  The  need  of  security  system  is  essential  to  make  safety 
against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and 
power consumer.

In  this  paper,  we  design  a  security  system  which  gives  remotely  security  against 
intrusion.  Our  work  presents,  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  smart  security  token 
system  consisting  of  two  technologies.  We  use  web-cam  or  CCTV  to  capture  images 
along a prescribed direction as first technology. The direction of capturing image will be 
controlled  remotely  using  GSM/GPRS  technology  and  send  image  equivalent  digital 
signal to the house owner’s mobile or mailing address. Voice synthesis is used as second 
technology  in  this  system  in  order  to  record  a  voice  and  check  the  current  record  voice 
with the voices which are validated previously through this system. 
 
2. Proposed System Overview 

The proposed work consists of a microcontroller based electronic control device named 
processing section. It acts as project processor which takes input from image processing 
unit and sound recording unit through UART RS-232 protocol and provides output to i. 
the  GSM  module  for  messaging  handler,  ii.  the  door  lock  circuitry  whether  the  door  is 
opened or not iii. Light alarm circuitry whether it indicates “Green” or “Red”. The overall 
system implementation probable view is given in Figure 1.

3. Proposed System Implementation 

In previous Overview passage, the overall system is classified into three sections, these 

are 1. Input Section, 2. Processing Section and 3. Output section. 

 

3.1. Input Section 

Input section consists of two unit, one is “Image processing technology” and another is 

“Voice synthesis technology”. 

3.1.1.  Overview  of  Image  Processing  Technology:  From  some  previous  decades, 
image  processing  has  been  taken  an  advisable  interest  as  bioinformatics  research.  A 
number  of  studies  in  previous  on  image  processing  and  image  computational  technique 
have been done mentioned in [6-14]. In this paper, for building face recognition system in 
order to get proper security of the proposed model was done using the 2D-DCT algorithm. 
The  proposed  model  has  been  effectively  implemented  by  taking  a  great  help  from  the 
works  in  [15-17].  In  this  project,  “Matlab  Image  Acquisition  Tool”  and  “Matlab  Image 
Processing  Tool”  are  used  as  image  processing  technology.  “Matlab  Image  Processing 
Tool” has a verse application on the field of image processing. The front view of “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Toolbar” is given in Figure 4 at the moment of capturing an image to 
save it as authorized file for the system.

Before  starting  acquisition  of  an  image,  we  set  acquisition  parameters  –data  type  as 
uint 8 bit and memory allocation to disk shown in Figure 5.aImage processing unit starts it 
action  by  acquitting  an  image  and  export  it  to  MATLAB  Workspace  of  a  valid  format 
similar of “file_name.mat”. In Workspace exported file is automatically converted to uint 
8, digital data with a specific bytes size is shown in Figure 5.b.

Matlab  is  a  regular  environment  for  conducting  experiments  in  the  scope  of  image 
processing.  One  typical  reason  for  containing  a  powerful  Image  Processing  Toolbox.  In 
particular,  the  matrix  operations  in  Matlab  are  effective  and  efficient  in  the  case  of 
implementation of a lot of image processing algorithms [18]. Therefore, Matlab has been 
widely  used  to  develop  algorithms  of  image  processing  [19].  This  paper  presents  a  new 
algorithm  for  human  face  recognition.  This  algorithm  uses  the  two-dimensional  discrete 
cosine transform (2D-DCT). The DCT converts images from the spatial or time domain to 
the complex frequency domain. Since lower frequencies are more visually importance in 
an  image  than  higher  frequencies,  the  DCT  reveals  high-frequency  coefficients  and 
quantizes  the  remaining  coefficients.  This  procedure  suppresses  data  volume  without 
losing  too  much  image  quality  [20].  The  2D-DCT  of  an  M  ×N  matrix  A  is  defined-as-
follows: 

 

 

 

The  values  Bpq  is  the  DCT  coefficients.  The  DCT  is  an  invertible  transform,  and  the 

2D-IDCT (2D Inverse-DCT) is defined as follows: 

 

 

Face identification digitally has become a great active area of research in recent years 
mainly  due  to  increase  security  demands  and  its  potentiality  in  commercial  purpose  and

losing  too  much  image  quality  [20].  The  2D-DCT  of  an  M  ×N  matrix  A  is  defined-as-

The  values  Bpq  is  the  DCT  coefficients.  The  DCT  is  an  invertible  transform,  and  the

Face identification digitally has become a great active area of research in recent years 
mainly  due  to  increase  security  demands  and  its  potentiality  in  commercial  purpose  and 
high demandable applications [18].

includes the following steps [21], 

   • Auto adjusting hue and saturation levels  

   • Adjusting brightness and contrast to fixed scale  

   • Desaturation of 24 bit RGB color into 8 bit grayscale  

   • Downsizing images to 512 × 512 pixels  

   • Saving images in jpg form.

4. Project Model Communication Protocol 

The  major  difficulty  of  communication  of  the  proposed  security  system  is  to 
communicate a single microcontroller with GSM module and with computer at a time. To 
make communication process easier among computer, microcontroller and GSM module, 
two  programming  features  of  microcontroller  are  needed  to  use,  one  is  conventional 
“Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter familiarly known “UART programming” 
and  another  is  Two  Wire  Serial  Interface  programming  or  “TWI”  programming.  UART 
programming  is  used  for  communicating  microcontroller  with  computer  and  TWI 
programming is used for communicating with GSM module. 

The Two-wire Serial Interface (TWI) is ideally suited for commercial microcontroller 
applications [22] in which up to 128 different devices are made interconnection [22]. In 
this project, one slave device “SIM-300” GSM module is connected to SDA and SCL line 
as like as following Figure 12.

1. Introduction  

An outlying home security, supervision and protection system have become more and 
more  desirable  with  the  progress  of  IT  technology,  network  and  automatic  control 
technology  now-a-days.  Wireless  sensor  network  (WSN)  and  global  system  for  mobile 
communication  (GSM)  technology  provide  a  better  design  and  development  of  remote 
home  security  and  supervene  system  whose  main  goal  is  to  identify  theft,  fire  etc.,  and 
send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary 
judgment  of  home  safety  [2].  The  need  of  security  system  is  essential  to  make  safety 
against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and 
power consumer.

In  this  paper,  we  design  a  security  system  which  gives  remotely  security  against 
intrusion.  Our  work  presents,  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  smart  security  token 
system  consisting  of  two  technologies.  We  use  web-cam  or  CCTV  to  capture  images 
along a prescribed direction as first technology. The direction of capturing image will be 
controlled  remotely  using  GSM/GPRS  technology  and  send  image  equivalent  digital 
signal to the house owner’s mobile or mailing address. Voice synthesis is used as second 
technology  in  this  system  in  order  to  record  a  voice  and  check  the  current  record  voice 
with the voices which are validated previously through this system. 
 
2. Proposed System Overview 

The proposed work consists of a microcontroller based electronic control device named 
processing section. It acts as project processor which takes input from image processing 
unit and sound recording unit through UART RS-232 protocol and provides output to i. 
the  GSM  module  for  messaging  handler,  ii.  the  door  lock  circuitry  whether  the  door  is 
opened or not iii. Light alarm circuitry whether it indicates “Green” or “Red”. The overall 
system implementation probable view is given in Figure 1.

The technical major complexity of the proposed security system is to merge computer, 
mobile & microcontroller and synchronization among the three sections. The sequence of

3. Proposed System Implementation 

In previous Overview passage, the overall system is classified into three sections, these 

are 1. Input Section, 2. Processing Section and 3. Output section. 

 

3.1. Input Section 

Input section consists of two unit, one is “Image processing technology” and another is 

“Voice synthesis technology”. 

3.1.1.  Overview  of  Image  Processing  Technology:  From  some  previous  decades, 
image  processing  has  been  taken  an  advisable  interest  as  bioinformatics  research.  A 
number  of  studies  in  previous  on  image  processing  and  image  computational  technique 
have been done mentioned in [6-14]. In this paper, for building face recognition system in 
order to get proper security of the proposed model was done using the 2D-DCT algorithm. 
The  proposed  model  has  been  effectively  implemented  by  taking  a  great  help  from  the 
works  in  [15-17].  In  this  project,  “Matlab  Image  Acquisition  Tool”  and  “Matlab  Image 
Processing  Tool”  are  used  as  image  processing  technology.  “Matlab  Image  Processing 
Tool” has a verse application on the field of image processing. The front view of “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Toolbar” is given in Figure 4 at the moment of capturing an image to 
save it as authorized file for the system. 
 

Figure 4.Font View of Image Acquisition Toolbox 

 

Before  starting  acquisition  of  an  image,  we  set  acquisition  parameters  –data  type  as 
uint 8 bit and memory allocation to disk shown in Figure 5.aImage processing unit starts it 
action  by  acquitting  an  image  and  export  it  to  MATLAB  Workspace  of  a  valid  format 
similar of “file_name.mat”. In Workspace exported file is automatically converted to uint 
8, digital data with a specific bytes size is shown in Figure 5.b.

Matlab  is  a  regular  environment  for  conducting  experiments  in  the  scope  of  image 
processing.  One  typical  reason  for  containing  a  powerful  Image  Processing  Toolbox.  In 
particular,  the  matrix  operations  in  Matlab  are  effective  and  efficient  in  the  case  of 
implementation of a lot of image processing algorithms [18]. Therefore, Matlab has been 
widely  used  to  develop  algorithms  of  image  processing  [19].  This  paper  presents  a  new 
algorithm  for  human  face  recognition.  This  algorithm  uses  the  two-dimensional  discrete 
cosine transform (2D-DCT). The DCT converts images from the spatial or time domain to 
the complex frequency domain. Since lower frequencies are more visually importance in 
an  image  than  higher  frequencies,  the  DCT  reveals  high-frequency  coefficients  and 
quantizes  the  remaining  coefficients.  This  procedure  suppresses  data  volume  without 
losing  too  much  image  quality  [20].  The  2D-DCT  of  an  M  ×N  matrix  A  is  defined-as-
follows: 

 

 

 

The  values  Bpq  is  the  DCT  coefficients.  The  DCT  is  an  invertible  transform,  and  the 

2D-IDCT (2D Inverse-DCT) is defined as follows: 

 

 

Face identification digitally has become a great active area of research in recent years 
mainly  due  to  increase  security  demands  and  its  potentiality  in  commercial  purpose  and 
high demandable applications [18]. 

Face  image  fabrication  process  of  different  accessible  user  are  taken  with  “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Tool” discussed in earlier is shown in Figure 6. Image pre-processing 
includes the following steps [21], 

   • Auto adjusting hue and saturation levels  

   • Adjusting brightness and contrast to fixed scale  

   • Desaturation of 24 bit RGB color into 8 bit grayscale  

   • Downsizing images to 512 × 512 pixels  

   • Saving images in jpg form.

1. Introduction  

An outlying home security, supervision and protection system have become more and 
more  desirable  with  the  progress  of  IT  technology,  network  and  automatic  control 
technology  now-a-days.  Wireless  sensor  network  (WSN)  and  global  system  for  mobile 
communication  (GSM)  technology  provide  a  better  design  and  development  of  remote 
home  security  and  supervene  system  whose  main  goal  is  to  identify  theft,  fire  etc.,  and 
send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary 
judgment  of  home  safety  [2].  The  need  of  security  system  is  essential  to  make  safety 
against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and 
power consumer.

In  this  paper,  we  design  a  security  system  which  gives  remotely  security  against 
intrusion.  Our  work  presents,  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  smart  security  token 
system  consisting  of  two  technologies.  We  use  web-cam  or  CCTV  to  capture  images 
along a prescribed direction as first technology. The direction of capturing image will be 
controlled  remotely  using  GSM/GPRS  technology  and  send  image  equivalent  digital 
signal to the house owner’s mobile or mailing address. Voice synthesis is used as second 
technology  in  this  system  in  order  to  record  a  voice  and  check  the  current  record  voice 
with the voices which are validated previously through this system. 
 
2. Proposed System Overview 

The proposed work consists of a microcontroller based electronic control device named 
processing section. It acts as project processor which takes input from image processing 
unit and sound recording unit through UART RS-232 protocol and provides output to i. 
the  GSM  module  for  messaging  handler,  ii.  the  door  lock  circuitry  whether  the  door  is 
opened or not iii. Light alarm circuitry whether it indicates “Green” or “Red”. The overall 
system implementation probable view is given in Figure 1.

3. Proposed System Implementation 

In previous Overview passage, the overall system is classified into three sections, these 

are 1. Input Section, 2. Processing Section and 3. Output section. 

 

3.1. Input Section 

Input section consists of two unit, one is “Image processing technology” and another is 

“Voice synthesis technology”. 

3.1.1.  Overview  of  Image  Processing  Technology:  From  some  previous  decades, 
image  processing  has  been  taken  an  advisable  interest  as  bioinformatics  research.  A 
number  of  studies  in  previous  on  image  processing  and  image  computational  technique 
have been done mentioned in [6-14]. In this paper, for building face recognition system in 
order to get proper security of the proposed model was done using the 2D-DCT algorithm. 
The  proposed  model  has  been  effectively  implemented  by  taking  a  great  help  from  the 
works  in  [15-17].  In  this  project,  “Matlab  Image  Acquisition  Tool”  and  “Matlab  Image 
Processing  Tool”  are  used  as  image  processing  technology.  “Matlab  Image  Processing 
Tool” has a verse application on the field of image processing. The front view of “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Toolbar” is given in Figure 4 at the moment of capturing an image to 
save it as authorized file for the system.

Before  starting  acquisition  of  an  image,  we  set  acquisition  parameters  –data  type  as 
uint 8 bit and memory allocation to disk shown in Figure 5.aImage processing unit starts it 
action  by  acquitting  an  image  and  export  it  to  MATLAB  Workspace  of  a  valid  format 
similar of “file_name.mat”. In Workspace exported file is automatically converted to uint 
8, digital data with a specific bytes size is shown in Figure 5.b.

Matlab  is  a  regular  environment  for  conducting  experiments  in  the  scope  of  image 
processing.  One  typical  reason  for  containing  a  powerful  Image  Processing  Toolbox.  In 
particular,  the  matrix  operations  in  Matlab  are  effective  and  efficient  in  the  case  of 
implementation of a lot of image processing algorithms [18]. Therefore, Matlab has been 
widely  used  to  develop  algorithms  of  image  processing  [19].  This  paper  presents  a  new 
algorithm  for  human  face  recognition.  This  algorithm  uses  the  two-dimensional  discrete 
cosine transform (2D-DCT). The DCT converts images from the spatial or time domain to 
the complex frequency domain. Since lower frequencies are more visually importance in 
an  image  than  higher  frequencies,  the  DCT  reveals  high-frequency  coefficients  and 
quantizes  the  remaining  coefficients.  This  procedure  suppresses  data  volume  without 
losing  too  much  image  quality  [20].  The  2D-DCT  of  an  M  ×N  matrix  A  is  defined-as-
follows: 

 

 

 

The  values  Bpq  is  the  DCT  coefficients.  The  DCT  is  an  invertible  transform,  and  the 

2D-IDCT (2D Inverse-DCT) is defined as follows: 

 

 

Face identification digitally has become a great active area of research in recent years 
mainly  due  to  increase  security  demands  and  its  potentiality  in  commercial  purpose  and 
high demandable applications [18]. 

Face  image  fabrication  process  of  different  accessible  user  are  taken  with  “Matlab 
Image Acquisition Tool” discussed in earlier is shown in Figure 6. Image pre-processing 
includes the following steps [21], 

   • Auto adjusting hue and saturation levels  

   • Adjusting brightness and contrast to fixed scale  

   • Desaturation of 24 bit RGB color into 8 bit grayscale  

   • Downsizing images to 512 × 512 pixels  

   • Saving images in jpg form.

If  any  image  data  available  in  the  Workspace  then  this  file  is  imported  to  Matlab 
Simulink  windows  using  “From  Workspace”  block.  And  display  the  data  value  on 
“Display Sink” block and finally send it to microcontroller based processing unit via “RS-
232 COM-13” port using microcontroller featured “UART”. The “Matlab Simulink tool” 
using in image processing technique is visualized in Figure 7.

Readable Data which is Available in COM-13 Port. It is Displayed at Display 

Sink on Matlab 

The data available in COM-13 Buffer is received as input by the microcontroller based 
processing  unit.  Then  processing  unit  tries  to  match  it  in  size  with  the  validated  data 
which is already registered in this system. So finally it has been concluded thefunction of 
image  processing  technique  is  a  sequentially  complex.  The  layout,  used  for  image 
processing in this system as well as algorithm of image modeling are given in Figure 8.

3.1.2.  Overview  of  Voice  Synthesis  Technology:  In  this  project,  a  software  for 
Windows-8  is  developed  named  “Voice  Syntheser  for  Security”  to  take  voice  command 
from a sound source such as human voice through headphone. This software is developed 
using C# object oriented programming. The front view of “Voice Syntheser for Security” 
software while a COM port connection is available, is shown in Figure 9.

The main task of “Voice Syntheser for Security” is to  take a sound for a time interval 
of  5  seconds  (time  interval  is  user  changeable)  via  headphone  and  after  that  interval,  it 
converts receiving sound to file_name.wav format with a specific byte size and generates 
a single digit automatically according to the file byte size value and finally sends single 
digit  value  to  the  connected  COM  port.  The  operational  flow  chart  of  voice  synthesis 
technology is shown in Figure 10.

3.2. Processing Section  

Processing  unit  consists  of  a  microcontroller  named  “Atmega  32”,  works  simply  as 
project  brain.  Processing  unit  takes  input  from  input  section,  processes  and  validates  it 
and  finally  provides  response  to  the  output  section  according  to  the  input.  The  logical 
arrangement and algorithm of operation of processing section is given in Figure 11.

3.3. Output Section  

Output section consists of a couple of LEDs, one is “Red” and the rest is “Green” work 
as alert light, door management system and GSM communication system. If validated or 
registered input signal is received then a “user access message” is sent to the house owner 
mobile number through GSM module “SIM-300”. Alert light indicates “Green” and door 
is  opened  and  if  invalidated  or  unregistered  input  signal  is  received  then  an  “intrusion 
alert message” is sent to the house owner mobile number then alert light indicates “Red” 
and door will never be opened.

4. Project Model Communication Protocol 

The  major  difficulty  of  communication  of  the  proposed  security  system  is  to 
communicate a single microcontroller with GSM module and with computer at a time. To 
make communication process easier among computer, microcontroller and GSM module, 
two  programming  features  of  microcontroller  are  needed  to  use,  one  is  conventional 
“Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter familiarly known “UART programming” 
and  another  is  Two  Wire  Serial  Interface  programming  or  “TWI”  programming.  UART 
programming  is  used  for  communicating  microcontroller  with  computer  and  TWI 
programming is used for communicating with GSM module. 

The Two-wire Serial Interface (TWI) is ideally suited for commercial microcontroller 
applications [22] in which up to 128 different devices are made interconnection [22]. In 
this project, one slave device “SIM-300” GSM module is connected to SDA and SCL line 
as like as following Figure 12.

5. Proposed Model Software Simulation and Results  

The analytical device operation is  simulated using Proteus 7 professional software. In 
Proteus  7  simulation  section,  communication  between  microcontroller  and  SIM-300  is 
absent  due  to  unavailability  SIM-300  component  in  the  software  library.  The  simulated 
circuit diagram, designed in Proteus software just before the moment of reading an input 
from input section (image processing unit & sound synthesis unit) is shown in Figure 14.

A  snapshot  is  shown  in  Figure15  which  indicates,  motor  is  off  mode  (inactive  door 
management system), Red  LED is on mode and send an alert message “An invalid user 
tried  to  access  the  security  system”  to  the  house  owner  mobile  no.  that  is  absence  in 
Proteus  simulation  when  an  unauthorized  or  unregistered  input  is  received  both  from 
image processing unit and voice synthesis unit.

6. Conclusions and Future Improvement 

The  system  described  in  this  paper  offers  the  best  performance.  It  ensures  the  most 
valuable  detection  of  any  type  of  intrusions  and  can  take  necessary  actions.  It  is  an 
efficient and cost-effective system and the output is more acceptable as an accurate which 
is implemented as prototype using MATLAB and practically examined. The next version 
of  this  device  will  be  demonstrated  soon  with  a  basic  development.  Firstly,  it  will  be 
upgraded  by  using  GPRS  and  sending  data  to  the  consumers  through  E-mail  and  sends 
continuous alert message to the nearest Police Station if the intrusion is occurred.

1. Introduction  

An outlying home security, supervision and protection system have become more and 
more  desirable  with  the  progress  of  IT  technology,  network  and  automatic  control 
technology  now-a-days.  Wireless  sensor  network  (WSN)  and  global  system  for  mobile 
communication  (GSM)  technology  provide  a  better  design  and  development  of  remote 
home  security  and  supervene  system  whose  main  goal  is  to  identify  theft,  fire  etc.,  and 
send SMS to the respective house owner’s mobile phone [1]. By visualizing home safety 
status on the controller desktop, laptop, PDA, mailing address or mobile phone, the user is 
always  notifying  with  the  current  view  of  home.  However,  appropriate  development  of 
this method provides justification of the current safety level as well as to make summary 
judgment  of  home  safety  [2].  The  need  of  security  system  is  essential  to  make  safety 
against  crime  and  burglary  acts  that  are  the  common  issues  now-a  -days.  Till  now,  a 
number  of  solutions  on  home  security  system  are  developed  and some  are  implemented 
successfully  in  the  market but  most  of  these  are  either  highly  expensive  or  have  lack  of 
pleasant security. For example, “Wireless home network using 802.11 technology” in [3] 
paper suggests a wireless home network security known as Wi-Fi security system, which 
provides  a  medium  for  transferring  media  files.  However,  it  is  highly  expensive  and 
power  consumer.  “Security  system  against  asset  theft  by  using  radio  frequency 
Identification Technology” and “Positioning and tracking construction vehicles in highly 
dense urban areas and building construction sites” both papers highly represent, graphical 
user  interface  (GUI),  is  used  in  vehicle  security  system  where  the  information  is 
controlled via the GUI [4, 5]. The system is activated when the tag image is read while the 
motor  cycle  is  being  located  within  the  effective  range.  It’s  also  highly  expensive  and 
power consumer.

“Display Sink” block and finally send it to microcontroller based processing unit via “RS-
232 COM-13” port using microcontroller featured “UART”. The “Matlab Simulink tool” 
using in image processing technique is visualized in Figure 7. 
 

 

Figure 7.Control Representation of Image Processing Technique Telling the 
Readable Data which is Available in COM-13 Port. It is Displayed at Display 

Sink on Matlab 

The data available in COM-13 Buffer is received as input by the microcontroller based 
processing  unit.  Then  processing  unit  tries  to  match  it  in  size  with  the  validated  data 
which is already registered in this system. So finally it has been concluded thefunction of 
image  processing  technique  is  a  sequentially  complex.  The  layout,  used  for  image 
processing in this system as well as algorithm of image modeling are given in Figure 8.

3.1.2.  Overview  of  Voice  Synthesis  Technology:  In  this  project,  a  software  for 
Windows-8  is  developed  named  “Voice  Syntheser  for  Security”  to  take  voice  command 
from a sound source such as human voice through headphone. This software is developed 
using C# object oriented programming. The front view of “Voice Syntheser for Security” 
software while a COM port connection is available, is shown in Figure 9.

The main task of “Voice Syntheser for Security” is to  take a sound for a time interval 
of  5  seconds  (time  interval  is  user  changeable)  via  headphone  and  after  that  interval,  it 
converts receiving sound to file_name.wav format with a specific byte size and generates 
a single digit automatically according to the file byte size value and finally sends single 
digit  value  to  the  connected  COM  port.  The  operational  flow  chart  of  voice  synthesis 
technology is shown in Figure 10.

3.2. Processing Section  

Processing  unit  consists  of  a  microcontroller  named  “Atmega  32”,  works  simply  as 
project  brain.  Processing  unit  takes  input  from  input  section,  processes  and  validates  it 
and  finally  provides  response  to  the  output  section  according  to  the  input.  The  logical 
arrangement and algorithm of operation of processing section is given in Figure 11.

Processing Section 

 

3.3. Output Section  

Output section consists of a couple of LEDs, one is “Red” and the rest is “Green” work 
as alert light, door management system and GSM communication system. If validated or 
registered input signal is received then a “user access message” is sent to the house owner 
mobile number through GSM module “SIM-300”. Alert light indicates “Green” and door 
is  opened  and  if  invalidated  or  unregistered  input  signal  is  received  then  an  “intrusion 
alert message” is sent to the house owner mobile number then alert light indicates “Red” 
and door will never be opened.

4. Project Model Communication Protocol 

The  major  difficulty  of  communication  of  the  proposed  security  system  is  to 
communicate a single microcontroller with GSM module and with computer at a time. To 
make communication process easier among computer, microcontroller and GSM module, 
two  programming  features  of  microcontroller  are  needed  to  use,  one  is  conventional 
“Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter familiarly known “UART programming” 
and  another  is  Two  Wire  Serial  Interface  programming  or  “TWI”  programming.  UART 
programming  is  used  for  communicating  microcontroller  with  computer  and  TWI 
programming is used for communicating with GSM module. 

The Two-wire Serial Interface (TWI) is ideally suited for commercial microcontroller 
applications [22] in which up to 128 different devices are made interconnection [22]. In 
this project, one slave device “SIM-300” GSM module is connected to SDA and SCL line 
as like as following Figure 12.

5. Proposed Model Software Simulation and Results  

The analytical device operation is  simulated using Proteus 7 professional software. In 
Proteus  7  simulation  section,  communication  between  microcontroller  and  SIM-300  is 
absent  due  to  unavailability  SIM-300  component  in  the  software  library.  The  simulated 
circuit diagram, designed in Proteus software just before the moment of reading an input 
from input section (image processing unit & sound synthesis unit) is shown in Figure 14. 

 

Figure 14. The Simulated Circuit Diagram for Processing Section 

A  snapshot  is  shown  in  Figure15  which  indicates,  motor  is  off  mode  (inactive  door 
management system), Red  LED is on mode and send an alert message “An invalid user 
tried  to  access  the  security  system”  to  the  house  owner  mobile  no.  that  is  absence  in 
Proteus  simulation  when  an  unauthorized  or  unregistered  input  is  received  both  from 
image processing unit and voice synthesis unit.

6. Conclusions and Future Improvement 

The  system  described  in  this  paper  offers  the  best  performance.  It  ensures  the  most 
valuable  detection  of  any  type  of  intrusions  and  can  take  necessary  actions.  It  is  an 
efficient and cost-effective system and the output is more acceptable as an accurate which 
is implemented as prototype using MATLAB and practically examined. The next version 
of  this  device  will  be  demonstrated  soon  with  a  basic  development.  Firstly,  it  will  be 
upgraded  by  using  GPRS  and  sending  data  to  the  consumers  through  E-mail  and  sends 
continuous alert message to the nearest Police Station if the intrusion is occurred.
