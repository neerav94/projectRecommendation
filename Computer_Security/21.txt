Not only can the DCS-933L connect via wireless N to your WPS-enabled router with a single press of a button, the 
extender mode can extend the range of your existing wireless network. This eliminates wireless dead spots to give 
you a more complete wireless coverage. 
 Included  with  the  DCS-933L  is  the  free  D-View  Cam  TM  software.  D-View  Cam  TM  IP  camera  surveillance 
software is a comprehensive surveillance system designed to centrally manage multiple IP cameras. Supporting up 
to  32  IP  cameras,  D-View  Cam  TM  is  compatible  with  all  current  D-Link  IP  cameras  and  provides  digital 
monitoring and recording of video, audio, and events for various security applications. This software provides users 
with  a  wide  array  of  features  for  added  convenience,  including  video  recording  and  playback,  Video  mode,  Map 
mode, Wizard mode, Expert mode, Event Action, and more. 

3. HARDWARE DESIGN 

The  Global  System  for  Mobile  communication,  usually  called  GSM,  Telecommunications  Standards  Institute 
(ETSI) to describe protocols for second generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones. The GSM 
standard was developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks, and originally described 
a  digital,  circuit  switched  network  optimized  for  full  duplex  voice  telephony.  This  was  expanded  over  time  to 
include data communications. PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human 
has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. 
For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. PIRs are basically 
made of a pyro electric sensor, which can detect levels of infrared radiation  
The  speech  recognition  system  is  a  completely  assembled   and  easy  to  use  programmable speech recognition 
circuit. Programmable, in the sense that you train the words (or vocal utterances) you want the circuit to recognize. 
This board allows you to experiment with many facets of speech recognition technology. It has 8 bit data out which 
can be interfaced with any microcontroller for further development. Some of  interfacing applications which can be 
made  are  controlling  home  appliances,  robotics  movements,  Speech  Assisted  technologies,  Speech  to  text 
translation, and many more.  
Radio-frequency  identification (RFID)  is  the  wireless  non-contact  use  of  radio-frequency electromagnetic  fields to 
transfer data,  for the purposes of automatically  identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. The tags contain 
electronically stored information. Some tags are powered by and read at short ranges (a  few  meters) via  magnetic 
fields  (electromagnetic  induction).  Others  use  a  local  power  source  such  as  a  battery,  or  else  have  no  battery  but 
collect  energy  from  the  interrogating  EM  field,  and  then  act  as  a  passive  transponder  to  emit  microwaves 
or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies). 
 
4. EXPERIMENT RESULTS       

 

In order to evaluate the device performance, we experiment on two aspects: testing whether the device may detected 
by the pir sensor and reader reads the cards to transmit the voice recorded .then message sent to mobile through gsm 
to check the wifi camera view in the mobile or pc

3. HARDWARE DESIGN 

The  Global  System  for  Mobile  communication,  usually  called  GSM,  Telecommunications  Standards  Institute 
(ETSI) to describe protocols for second generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones. The GSM 
standard was developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks, and originally described 
a  digital,  circuit  switched  network  optimized  for  full  duplex  voice  telephony.  This  was  expanded  over  time  to 
include data communications. PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human 
has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. 
For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. PIRs are basically 
made of a pyro electric sensor, which can detect levels of infrared radiation  
The  speech  recognition  system  is  a  completely  assembled   and  easy  to  use  programmable speech recognition 
circuit. Programmable, in the sense that you train the words (or vocal utterances) you want the circuit to recognize. 
This board allows you to experiment with many facets of speech recognition technology. It has 8 bit data out which 
can be interfaced with any microcontroller for further development. Some of  interfacing applications which can be 
made  are  controlling  home  appliances,  robotics  movements,  Speech  Assisted  technologies,  Speech  to  text 
translation, and many more.  
Radio-frequency  identification (RFID)  is  the  wireless  non-contact  use  of  radio-frequency electromagnetic  fields to 
transfer data,  for the purposes of automatically  identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. The tags contain 
electronically stored information. Some tags are powered by and read at short ranges (a  few  meters) via  magnetic 
fields  (electromagnetic  induction).  Others  use  a  local  power  source  such  as  a  battery,  or  else  have  no  battery  but 
collect  energy  from  the  interrogating  EM  field,  and  then  act  as  a  passive  transponder  to  emit  microwaves 
or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies). 
 
4. EXPERIMENT RESULTS       

 

In order to evaluate the device performance, we experiment on two aspects: testing whether the device may detected 
by the pir sensor and reader reads the cards to transmit the voice recorded .then message sent to mobile through gsm 
to check the wifi camera view in the mobile or pc

This paper introduces a smart home security system based on the technology 
of  ARM  and  3G  communication.  It  uses  lpc1768  hardware  platform  and 
embedded Linux operating  system to implement the real-time display of the 
video images on the development platform. It presents the structure and work 
principles  of the  system, puts emphasis  on the  hardware processing  circuits 
and design of video image software as well as the foundation  of 3G remote 
communication.    Another,  It  carefully  analyzes  and  studies  video  data 
compression of wifi camera and the 3G network transmission. Thus, a design 
of  a  convenient  and  economical  device  on  real-time  video  capture  and 
transmission is realized.

Introduction 
The home security system using the wireless technology which is used to give indication that somebody entered into 
the  room  by  giving  buzzer  sound  as  an  indication  which  is  just  used  to  alert  the  people  inside  the  home.  But  if 
nobody is present inside the home even if buzzer sound indication doesn’t alert the people .This introduces a smart 
home security system based on the technology of ARM and 3G communication. It uses lpc1768 hardware platform 
and windows operating system to implement the real-time display of the video images on the development platform. 
It  presents the structure and work principles  of the  system, puts emphasis  on the hardware processing circuits and 
design of video image software as well as the foundation of 3G remote communication.

The  purpose  of  this    is  to  improve  the  deficiencies  of  the  control  network  in  current  smart  home  system,  and  to 
design the controller module, 3G module and wireless module for home security where as the first thing was when 
any stranger who enters in to the house can sense by the pir sensor .which detects up to 2mts when the detection was 
done immediately voice message has come out of the voice module. Then a message was sent to registered mobile 
number in the GSM module where we place a SIM card in to it. the external module was WIFI camera. Where we 
can see the concerned output when we registered with the camera through wirelessly the camera display the image 
where  we  placed  we  can  capture  the  images  for  further  use  in  our  mobile  phones.  By  using  prescribed  camera 
application in our mobiles or pc we see the output of the camera.
