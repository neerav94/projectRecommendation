Summary 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system is now becoming 
widely  accepted  for  many  ubiquitous  computing  applications.  
However, RFID system has some privacy problems. Therefore, 
many researches results related to security and privacy in 
RFID  system.  However,  we  cannot  choose  anything  among 
them  for  applying  to  the  current  RFID  system.  Most  of  them 
require  either  of  high-cost  hardware  specification  or  giving  up 
potential convenience of consumers. In this paper, we propose a 
simple privacy protection scheme that can be used for the current 
existing RFID system such as ISO 18000-6 type C. We modify 
this standard tag identification protocol slightly and introduce a 
light-weight proxy device for privacy enhancing.

queries, the RFID tag transmits identification information 
such  as  an  ID,  to  the  RFID  reader  by  means  of  a  Radio 
Frequency  signal.  An  RFID  reader  known  as  transceiver 
or  interrogator.  The  reader  generally  consists  of  an  RF 
module, control unit, and coupling element to interrogate 
electronic  tags  via  RF  communication.  An  RFID  reader 
receives identification information from an RFID tag and 
subsequently  delivers  this  information 
to  the  RFID 
middleware. The RFID reader can read and write data on 
the RFID tags.  

The RFID tag is either an active or a passive tag. active 
tag possesses a battery and actively transmits information 
to the reader for communication. The passive tag must be 
inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader since 
RFID tags usually do not possess their own battery power 
supply. The EPC is stored on this tag. Tags communicate 
their EPCs to readers using a RF signal.

exchange  EPC-related  data  with  trading  partners  through

available  through  the  EPCIS  may  include  tag  data 
collected  from  EPC  middleware  such  as  date  of 
manufacture, expiry date, and product information.

EPC  Middleware  manages  EPC  data  received  from  the 
reader,  provides  alerts,  and 
for 
communication to the EPCIS (EPC Information Services) 
or the company's other existing information systems. EPC 
is  developing  a  software  interface  standard  for  services 
enabling  data  exchange  between  an  EPC  reader  or 
network  of  readers  and 
information  systems.  EPC

coming from one or more readers, and this particular piece 
of software manages readers.

RFID systems are basically composed of tags and readers. 
An  RFID  tag,  also  known  as  a  transponder,  is  an  RFID 
device consisting of a microchip and antenna attached to a 
substrate. The microchip in the tag is used for data storage 
and logical operations, whereas the coiled antenna is used 
for communication with the reader. When the RFID reader

(ONS) is one component of Discovery Services[11]. The 
ONS  provides  a  global  lookup  service,  translating  EPCs 
into  one  or  more  Internet  Uniform  Reference  Locators 
(URLs),  where  further  information  regarding  the  object 
may be retrieved. In short, the ONS provides yellow page 
services  for  the  EPC  Network,  allowing  participants  to 
quickly  discover

RFID systems are composed of three main elements: RFID

channel,  i.e.,  the  reader  to  the  tag,  is  assumed  to  be 
broadcast  with  an  RF  signal  that  can  do  long-range 
monitoring. On the other hand, the backward channel, i.e., 
the tag to the reader, is relatively much weaker, enabling 
monitoring only by eavesdroppers within the tag's shorter 
operating  range.  In  general,  it  is  assumed  that  eaves-
droppers can monitor only the forward channel undetected

[12,13,14]. Figure 3 shows the basic RFID system. 
 

Fig. 3  Basic Passive RFID System [20] 

 

As the data carrier in the RFID system, the RFID tag or 
transponder  includes  object-identifying  data.  Tags  are 
generally composed of an IC chip and an antenna. The IC 
chip  in  the  tag  is  used  for  data  storage  and  logical 
operations,  whereas  the  coiled  antenna  is  used  for 
communication  between  the  reader.  The  RFID  tag  may 
either  be  active  or  passive.  The  Active  tag  has  a  battery 
and  actively  sends  the  information  to  the  reader  for 
communication.  On  the  other  hand,  the  passive  tag  must 
be inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader. 
Both types of the tag begin to communicate when they are 
interrogated by the reader. In this paper, the passive type 
of RFID tag is considered. 
 

- RFID reader or transceiver is a device that sends an 
RF signal to the tag, receives the information from the 
tag,  and  sends  such  information  to  the  back-end 
database. The reader may read and write data to the tag. 
In general, readers are composed of the RF module, a 
control  unit,  and  a  coupling  element  to  interrogate 
electronic tags via RF communication. 

-  Back-end  database  is  the  data-processing  system  that 
stores  related  information  (e.g.,  product  information, 
tracking logs, reader location, etc) with a particular tag. 

3. Related Work 

Until  now  there  are  many  research  results  for  RFID 
privacy  protection,  but  we  introduce  only  three  of  them 
related to our proposing scheme directly.  

3.1 Blocker tag 

Juels’ blocker  tag which can be used as  a  shield  for  a 
customer’s tags [3,4]. RFID system normally has an anti-
collision  protocol  for  reading  multiple  tags.  The  blocker 
tag uses anti-collision protocols reversely for hiding tags. 
A blocker tag will make a collision whenever any reader 

 

tries to scan the tags inside its coverage. Consequently, the 
blocker tag is one of active jamming devices, and it can be 
used for illegal purposes such as theft. And it works with 
the tags inside its physical coverage, but not with the tags 
logically belonging to the customer.  

3.2 Using Proxy Device 

Another  approach  is  an  external  device  approach,  in 
which a customer uses a proxy device for protecting his or 
her privacy. There are three representative schemes in this 
approach;  Rieback’s  RFID  guardian  project[5],  Juels’ 
REP[6],  Kim’s  MARP[7],  and  Yeo’s  eMARP[8].  In  this 
approach, an external device serves as a proxy agent for its 
holder,  and  it  can  have  a  general  cryptographic  modules 
and  process  pretty  complicated  protocols.  And  proxy 
agents  seem  to  be  embedded  into  other  mobile  devices 
such  as  cellular  phones  and  PDA’s  in  the  near  future. 
However, there no regulations and standards related to this 
approach until now, so we need much time to apply these 
schemes to the current RFID systems.  

3.3 Backward Channel Protection Scheme 

Backward  channel  protection  scheme[9],  which  is  a 
simple and practical scheme and can be used in the current 
RFID systems. In this scheme, the reader’s action is very 
important.  A  reader  has  to  protect  the  tag’s  k-bit  static 
identifier which is in communication with the reader itself. 
The reader emits a k-bit random number at the same time 
when the tag emits its static identifier and then this action 
makes a collision eventually. The  reader can resolve this 
collision because it knows one number of the two collided 
numbers.  

the 

identifier 

tag’s  static 

However,  passive  attackers  can’t  resolve  this  collision 
and  can’t  know 
from 
eavesdropping  of  backward  channel  because  they  can’t 
distinguish  the  tag’s  identifier  from  the  reader’s  random 
number. Figure 4 show how this protocol works in detail. 
However,  if  a  reader  doesn’t  provide  this  protection 
scheme  or  an  active  attacker  try  to  communicate  tags 
directly,  the  tags  emit  their  static  identifier  without  any 
protection mechanisms.

However, RFID system has some privacy problems. Therefore, 
many researches results related to security and privacy in 
RFID  system.  However,  we  cannot  choose  anything  among 
them  for  applying  to  the  current  RFID  system.  Most  of  them 
require  either  of  high-cost  hardware  specification  or  giving  up 
potential convenience of consumers. In this paper, we propose a 
simple privacy protection scheme that can be used for the current 
existing RFID system such as ISO 18000-6 type C. We modify 
this standard tag identification protocol slightly and introduce a

2. RFID System Overview 

2.1 EPC 

The binary representation of the EPC (Electronic Product 
Code),  a  combination  of  Header,  EPC  Manager,  Object 
Class,  and  Serial Number. Header  identifies  the  version, 
length, tag type, and structure of the code. EPC Manager 
identifies  a  company,  a  manager,  or  an  organization.  In 
short,  it  indicates  a  manufacturer  ID.  Object  Class 
indicates article classification (manufacturer's product ID). 
The  class  number  must  be  unique  for  all  given  domains. 
Serial Number is unique for every class and non-repeating 
for each object class code.  

The  figure  1  shows  the  EPC  and  figure  2  shows  EPC

- Header  :  identifies  the  version,  length,  tag  type,  and 
structure of the code. The 64-bit type assigns 2-bit for 
the header field, whereas 96/256-bit types use an 8-bit 
header. 

- EPC  Manager  :  identifies  a  company,  a  manager,  or 
an  organization.  This  value  ensures  that  each  domain

number is unique. In short, it identifies the code of the 
manufacturer (e.g., Coca-Cola company). 

- Object Class : indicates article classification. The class 
number  must  be  unique  for  all  given  domains  (e.g., 
Coke 280ml can). 

- Serial  Number  :  unique  for  every  class  and  non-
repeating for each object class code (e.g.,  any unique 
Coke 280ml can).  

 

queries, the RFID tag transmits identification information 
such  as  an  ID,  to  the  RFID  reader  by  means  of  a  Radio 
Frequency  signal.  An  RFID  reader  known  as  transceiver 
or  interrogator.  The  reader  generally  consists  of  an  RF 
module, control unit, and coupling element to interrogate 
electronic  tags  via  RF  communication.  An  RFID  reader 
receives identification information from an RFID tag and 
subsequently  delivers  this  information 
to  the  RFID 
middleware. The RFID reader can read and write data on 
the RFID tags.  

The RFID tag is either an active or a passive tag. active 
tag possesses a battery and actively transmits information 
to the reader for communication. The passive tag must be 
inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader since 
RFID tags usually do not possess their own battery power 
supply. The EPC is stored on this tag. Tags communicate 
their EPCs to readers using a RF signal.

2.4 Information Service 

EPCIS  (EPC  Information  Services)  enables  users  to 
exchange  EPC-related  data  with  trading  partners  through 
the EPC Network. EPCIS provides EPC Network related 
data  available  in  PML  format  to  request  services.  Data 
available  through  the  EPCIS  may  include  tag  data 
collected  from  EPC  middleware  such  as  date  of 
manufacture, expiry date, and product information.

EPC  Middleware  manages  EPC  data  received  from  the 
reader,  provides  alerts,  and 
for 
communication to the EPCIS (EPC Information Services) 
or the company's other existing information systems. EPC 
is  developing  a  software  interface  standard  for  services 
enabling  data  exchange  between  an  EPC  reader  or 
network  of  readers  and 
information  systems.  EPC 
middleware  designed  to  process  the  stream  of  tag  data 
coming from one or more readers, and this particular piece 
of software manages readers. 

2.3 RFID tag and reader 

RFID systems are basically composed of tags and readers. 
An  RFID  tag,  also  known  as  a  transponder,  is  an  RFID 
device consisting of a microchip and antenna attached to a 
substrate. The microchip in the tag is used for data storage 
and logical operations, whereas the coiled antenna is used 
for communication with the reader. When the RFID reader 

 

A  Discovery  Services  enables  users  to  find  information 
related  to  a  specific  ID  and  to  request  access  to  that 
information. In EPC network, An Object Naming Service 
(ONS) is one component of Discovery Services[11]. The 
ONS  provides  a  global  lookup  service,  translating  EPCs 
into  one  or  more  Internet  Uniform  Reference  Locators 
(URLs),  where  further  information  regarding  the  object 
may be retrieved. In short, the ONS provides yellow page 
services  for  the  EPC  Network,  allowing  participants  to 
quickly  discover 
the  EPC  Network 
containing  the  information  associated  with  a  particular 
EPC.  The  ONS  works  same  as  Domain  Name  Service 
(DNS), the foundation naming protocol for the Internet.

2.6 Basic RFID System 

RFID systems are composed of three main elements: RFID 
tag,  RFID  reader,  and  back-end  database.  The  forward 
channel,  i.e.,  the  reader  to  the  tag,  is  assumed  to  be 
broadcast  with  an  RF  signal  that  can  do  long-range 
monitoring. On the other hand, the backward channel, i.e., 
the tag to the reader, is relatively much weaker, enabling 
monitoring only by eavesdroppers within the tag's shorter 
operating  range.  In  general,  it  is  assumed  that  eaves-
droppers can monitor only the forward channel undetected

[12,13,14]. Figure 3 shows the basic RFID system. 
 

Fig. 3  Basic Passive RFID System [20] 

 

As the data carrier in the RFID system, the RFID tag or 
transponder  includes  object-identifying  data.  Tags  are 
generally composed of an IC chip and an antenna. The IC 
chip  in  the  tag  is  used  for  data  storage  and  logical 
operations,  whereas  the  coiled  antenna  is  used  for 
communication  between  the  reader.  The  RFID  tag  may 
either  be  active  or  passive.  The  Active  tag  has  a  battery 
and  actively  sends  the  information  to  the  reader  for 
communication.  On  the  other  hand,  the  passive  tag  must 
be inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader. 
Both types of the tag begin to communicate when they are 
interrogated by the reader. In this paper, the passive type 
of RFID tag is considered. 
 

- RFID reader or transceiver is a device that sends an 
RF signal to the tag, receives the information from the 
tag,  and  sends  such  information  to  the  back-end 
database. The reader may read and write data to the tag. 
In general, readers are composed of the RF module, a 
control  unit,  and  a  coupling  element  to  interrogate 
electronic tags via RF communication. 

-  Back-end  database  is  the  data-processing  system  that 
stores  related  information  (e.g.,  product  information, 
tracking logs, reader location, etc) with a particular tag. 

3. Related Work 

Until  now  there  are  many  research  results  for  RFID 
privacy  protection,  but  we  introduce  only  three  of  them 
related to our proposing scheme directly.  

3.1 Blocker tag 

Juels’ blocker  tag which can be used as  a  shield  for  a 
customer’s tags [3,4]. RFID system normally has an anti-
collision  protocol  for  reading  multiple  tags.  The  blocker 
tag uses anti-collision protocols reversely for hiding tags. 
A blocker tag will make a collision whenever any reader 

 

tries to scan the tags inside its coverage. Consequently, the 
blocker tag is one of active jamming devices, and it can be 
used for illegal purposes such as theft. And it works with 
the tags inside its physical coverage, but not with the tags 
logically belonging to the customer.  

3.2 Using Proxy Device 

Another  approach  is  an  external  device  approach,  in 
which a customer uses a proxy device for protecting his or 
her privacy. There are three representative schemes in this 
approach;  Rieback’s  RFID  guardian  project[5],  Juels’ 
REP[6],  Kim’s  MARP[7],  and  Yeo’s  eMARP[8].  In  this 
approach, an external device serves as a proxy agent for its 
holder,  and  it  can  have  a  general  cryptographic  modules 
and  process  pretty  complicated  protocols.  And  proxy 
agents  seem  to  be  embedded  into  other  mobile  devices 
such  as  cellular  phones  and  PDA’s  in  the  near  future. 
However, there no regulations and standards related to this 
approach until now, so we need much time to apply these 
schemes to the current RFID systems.  

3.3 Backward Channel Protection Scheme 

Backward  channel  protection  scheme[9],  which  is  a 
simple and practical scheme and can be used in the current 
RFID systems. In this scheme, the reader’s action is very 
important.  A  reader  has  to  protect  the  tag’s  k-bit  static 
identifier which is in communication with the reader itself. 
The reader emits a k-bit random number at the same time 
when the tag emits its static identifier and then this action 
makes a collision eventually. The  reader can resolve this 
collision because it knows one number of the two collided 
numbers.  

the 

identifier 

tag’s  static 

However,  passive  attackers  can’t  resolve  this  collision 
and  can’t  know 
from 
eavesdropping  of  backward  channel  because  they  can’t 
distinguish  the  tag’s  identifier  from  the  reader’s  random 
number. Figure 4 show how this protocol works in detail. 
However,  if  a  reader  doesn’t  provide  this  protection 
scheme  or  an  active  attacker  try  to  communicate  tags 
directly,  the  tags  emit  their  static  identifier  without  any 
protection mechanisms.

3. Proposed Protocol 

We propose a simple proxy device between reader and tag, 
and  this  device  is  controlled  by  a  customer.  A  customer 
uses this proxy device for her privacy protection  and for 
preventing  unauthorized  tag  scanning  by  attackers.  Our 
proxy  device  protects  all  of  registered  tag  in  its  radio 
signal  coverage.  It  should  be  able  to  connect  to  public 
certificate authorities for verifying reader’s public key or 
have an authenticated readers’ public key list.  

In  the  case  that  a  customer  doesn’t  have  any  proxy 
device  or  doesn’t  turn  on  her  proxy  device,  the  current 
standard  RFID  protocols  are  used  and  any  tags  of  the 
customer  can’t  be  protected  from  all  attacks.  In  the  case 
that a customer turns on her proxy device, we have to use 
a new protocol, which can be simply added to the current 
standard protocols, especially to ISO 18000-6 type C[10].  
Figure 5 shows an example of this standard protocol. In 
this slotted  random  anti-collision,  tags  load  a  random  ID 
into  a  slot  counter,  decrement  this  slot  counter  based  on 
Interrogator commands, and reply to the Interrogator when 
their  slot  counter  reaches  zero.  However,  this  standard 
protocol has a big privacy problem that any readers in the 
radio-frequency range can hear the unique ID of the  tag, 
EPC code. 
 

Fig. 5  An operating example of ISO 18000-6 type C. 

 

 

Our overall protocol can be categorized to four phases; 
tag  registration  phase,  tag  identifying  phase,  resolving 
phase  for  unregistered  tags,  and  resolving  phase  for 
registered tags.  

 
A. Registration phase  
 

1. a customer has to register her all tags to her proxy 

device with their static identifiers.  

2. After registration, the proxy device stores all static 
identifiers  of  customers’  tags  into  its  non-volatile 
memory.  (we  assume  that  the  registration  phase 
should be done in secure environment without any 
threats  and  we  assume 
there  are  some 
unregistered  tags  in  the  proxy  device’s  radio 
frequency range.)  

that 

3. The  latter  assumption  makes  our  scheme  more 
user-controllable than Juels’ blocker tag scheme[3], 
in which a blocker tag blocks all of the tags in its 

 

communication coverage, but not depending on the 
customer’s controlling.  

 
B. Tag identifying phase  
 

1. the reader and the tags follows the standard RFID 
protocols,  but  the  proxy  device  do  something  for 
protecting registered tags’ identifier.  

2. After  a  singulation  step,  the  reader  send  ACK 
message  to  the  selected  tag  for  getting  the  tag’s 
real static identifier.  

3. The  tag  sends  its  static  IDi  to  the  reader.  At  the 
exact  same  time  to  the  tag’s  response,  the  proxy 
device sends a random number Ri to the reader.  

4. The proxy device sends different random numbers 
Ri to the reader at the same time to each tag’s IDi 
response.  The  proxy  device  stores  its  all  random 
numbers  for  all  tags  which  were  scanned  by  the 
reader and it  can  resolve  the real  static  identifiers 
of all tags because it knows all collision bit strings 
and its own random numbers which were used for 
making collisions.  

In  the  eavesdropper’s  view,  he  can  hear  only 
collision  bit  string  and  he  can  know  only  some  bits 
which  are  not  collided  on  every  tag  identification 
steps.  This  situation  happens  to  the  reader  equally. 
The reader cannot resolve any identifiers of scanned 
tags, but it stores all collision bit strings, Ci, into its 
memory.

2.6 Basic RFID System 

RFID systems are composed of three main elements: RFID 
tag,  RFID  reader,  and  back-end  database.  The  forward 
channel,  i.e.,  the  reader  to  the  tag,  is  assumed  to  be 
broadcast  with  an  RF  signal  that  can  do  long-range 
monitoring. On the other hand, the backward channel, i.e., 
the tag to the reader, is relatively much weaker, enabling 
monitoring only by eavesdroppers within the tag's shorter 
operating  range.  In  general,  it  is  assumed  that  eaves-
droppers can monitor only the forward channel undetected

As the data carrier in the RFID system, the RFID tag or 
transponder  includes  object-identifying  data.  Tags  are 
generally composed of an IC chip and an antenna. The IC 
chip  in  the  tag  is  used  for  data  storage  and  logical 
operations,  whereas  the  coiled  antenna  is  used  for 
communication  between  the  reader.  The  RFID  tag  may 
either  be  active  or  passive.  The  Active  tag  has  a  battery 
and  actively  sends  the  information  to  the  reader  for 
communication.  On  the  other  hand,  the  passive  tag  must 
be inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader. 
Both types of the tag begin to communicate when they are 
interrogated by the reader. In this paper, the passive type 
of RFID tag is considered. 
 

- RFID reader or transceiver is a device that sends an 
RF signal to the tag, receives the information from the 
tag,  and  sends  such  information  to  the  back-end 
database. The reader may read and write data to the tag. 
In general, readers are composed of the RF module, a 
control  unit,  and  a  coupling  element  to  interrogate 
electronic tags via RF communication. 

-  Back-end  database  is  the  data-processing  system  that 
stores  related  information  (e.g.,  product  information, 
tracking logs, reader location, etc) with a particular tag. 

3. Related Work 

Until  now  there  are  many  research  results  for  RFID 
privacy  protection,  but  we  introduce  only  three  of  them 
related to our proposing scheme directly.  

3.1 Blocker tag 

Juels’ blocker  tag which can be used as  a  shield  for  a 
customer’s tags [3,4]. RFID system normally has an anti-
collision  protocol  for  reading  multiple  tags.  The  blocker 
tag uses anti-collision protocols reversely for hiding tags. 
A blocker tag will make a collision whenever any reader 

 

tries to scan the tags inside its coverage. Consequently, the 
blocker tag is one of active jamming devices, and it can be 
used for illegal purposes such as theft. And it works with 
the tags inside its physical coverage, but not with the tags 
logically belonging to the customer.  

3.2 Using Proxy Device 

Another  approach  is  an  external  device  approach,  in 
which a customer uses a proxy device for protecting his or 
her privacy. There are three representative schemes in this 
approach;  Rieback’s  RFID  guardian  project[5],  Juels’ 
REP[6],  Kim’s  MARP[7],  and  Yeo’s  eMARP[8].  In  this 
approach, an external device serves as a proxy agent for its 
holder,  and  it  can  have  a  general  cryptographic  modules 
and  process  pretty  complicated  protocols.  And  proxy 
agents  seem  to  be  embedded  into  other  mobile  devices 
such  as  cellular  phones  and  PDA’s  in  the  near  future. 
However, there no regulations and standards related to this 
approach until now, so we need much time to apply these 
schemes to the current RFID systems.  

3.3 Backward Channel Protection Scheme 

Backward  channel  protection  scheme[9],  which  is  a 
simple and practical scheme and can be used in the current 
RFID systems. In this scheme, the reader’s action is very 
important.  A  reader  has  to  protect  the  tag’s  k-bit  static 
identifier which is in communication with the reader itself. 
The reader emits a k-bit random number at the same time 
when the tag emits its static identifier and then this action 
makes a collision eventually. The  reader can resolve this 
collision because it knows one number of the two collided 
numbers.  

the 

identifier 

tag’s  static 

However,  passive  attackers  can’t  resolve  this  collision 
and  can’t  know 
from 
eavesdropping  of  backward  channel  because  they  can’t 
distinguish  the  tag’s  identifier  from  the  reader’s  random 
number. Figure 4 show how this protocol works in detail. 
However,  if  a  reader  doesn’t  provide  this  protection 
scheme  or  an  active  attacker  try  to  communicate  tags 
directly,  the  tags  emit  their  static  identifier  without  any 
protection mechanisms.

3. Proposed Protocol 

We propose a simple proxy device between reader and tag, 
and  this  device  is  controlled  by  a  customer.  A  customer 
uses this proxy device for her privacy protection  and for 
preventing  unauthorized  tag  scanning  by  attackers.  Our 
proxy  device  protects  all  of  registered  tag  in  its  radio 
signal  coverage.  It  should  be  able  to  connect  to  public 
certificate authorities for verifying reader’s public key or 
have an authenticated readers’ public key list.  

In  the  case  that  a  customer  doesn’t  have  any  proxy 
device  or  doesn’t  turn  on  her  proxy  device,  the  current 
standard  RFID  protocols  are  used  and  any  tags  of  the 
customer  can’t  be  protected  from  all  attacks.  In  the  case 
that a customer turns on her proxy device, we have to use 
a new protocol, which can be simply added to the current 
standard protocols, especially to ISO 18000-6 type C[10].  
Figure 5 shows an example of this standard protocol. In 
this slotted  random  anti-collision,  tags  load  a  random  ID 
into  a  slot  counter,  decrement  this  slot  counter  based  on 
Interrogator commands, and reply to the Interrogator when 
their  slot  counter  reaches  zero.  However,  this  standard 
protocol has a big privacy problem that any readers in the 
radio-frequency range can hear the unique ID of the  tag, 
EPC code. 
 

Fig. 5  An operating example of ISO 18000-6 type C. 

 

 

Our overall protocol can be categorized to four phases; 
tag  registration  phase,  tag  identifying  phase,  resolving 
phase  for  unregistered  tags,  and  resolving  phase  for 
registered tags.  

 
A. Registration phase  
 

1. a customer has to register her all tags to her proxy 

device with their static identifiers.  

2. After registration, the proxy device stores all static 
identifiers  of  customers’  tags  into  its  non-volatile 
memory.  (we  assume  that  the  registration  phase 
should be done in secure environment without any 
threats  and  we  assume 
there  are  some 
unregistered  tags  in  the  proxy  device’s  radio 
frequency range.)  

that 

3. The  latter  assumption  makes  our  scheme  more 
user-controllable than Juels’ blocker tag scheme[3], 
in which a blocker tag blocks all of the tags in its 

 

communication coverage, but not depending on the 
customer’s controlling.  

 
B. Tag identifying phase  
 

1. the reader and the tags follows the standard RFID 
protocols,  but  the  proxy  device  do  something  for 
protecting registered tags’ identifier.  

2. After  a  singulation  step,  the  reader  send  ACK 
message  to  the  selected  tag  for  getting  the  tag’s 
real static identifier.  

3. The  tag  sends  its  static  IDi  to  the  reader.  At  the 
exact  same  time  to  the  tag’s  response,  the  proxy 
device sends a random number Ri to the reader.  

4. The proxy device sends different random numbers 
Ri to the reader at the same time to each tag’s IDi 
response.  The  proxy  device  stores  its  all  random 
numbers  for  all  tags  which  were  scanned  by  the 
reader and it  can  resolve  the real  static  identifiers 
of all tags because it knows all collision bit strings 
and its own random numbers which were used for 
making collisions.  

In  the  eavesdropper’s  view,  he  can  hear  only 
collision  bit  string  and  he  can  know  only  some  bits 
which  are  not  collided  on  every  tag  identification 
steps.  This  situation  happens  to  the  reader  equally. 
The reader cannot resolve any identifiers of scanned 
tags, but it stores all collision bit strings, Ci, into its 
memory.

C. Resolving phase for unregistered tags 
 
In  this  phase,  the  reader  requests  the  proxy  device  to 
send  the  set  of  random  numbers  that  were  used  for 
unregistered tags.

1. The proxy device knows all of its random numbers 
that  were  used  for  making  collision  and  all 
identifiers  of  tags  that  were  involved  in  the  prior 
phase.  

2. The  proxy  also  may  know  which  numbers  were 
used  for  unregistered  tags  because  it  has  the 
registered tag list.  

3. Then,  we  can  define  Ru  as  the  set  of  random 

numbers for unregistered tags.  

4. The  proxy  device  sends  Ru  to  the  reader  without 
authentication because we think that “unregistered” 
means “unprotected” in the view of customers.  

5. The  reader  can  resolve  the  unregistered  tags’ 

identifiers from comparing Ru and Ci.  

 
D. Resolving phase for registered tags 
 

1. The  reader  requests  the  proxy  device  to  send  Rs, 
the  set  of  random  number  random  numbers  that 
were used for unregistered tags.  

2. For  completing  this  phase,  the  reader  has  its  own 
public key with a valid registered certificate and it 
sends the certificate to the proxy device.  

3. After  receiving  the  certificate  of  the  reader,  the 

proxy device check whether it is valid or not.  

4. A  valid  certificate  means  that  the  reader  is 

authenticated and registered one.  

We  don’t  want  to  fix  the  method  for  checking  the 
validity of the certificate in this scheme. However, it will 
be a possible method that the proxy device does an on-line 
transaction  with  a  public  certificate  authority,  CA,  for 
checking the reader’s validity.  

If the proxy device should work in off-line environment, 
it is possible to manage the authenticated readers list and 
their  public  key  list  that  may  be  updated  regularly. 
Anyway,  

5. after  the  proxy  device  check  the  validity  of  the 
reader  and  the  reader’s  public  key,  the  proxy 
device encrypt Rs with the reader’s public key, KRd 
and  then  send  the  encrypted  message,  a,  to  the 
reader. 

6. The reader can decrypt the message a with its own 
private key, KRe. Eventually, the reader can resolve 
the  registered  tags’  identifiers  from  comparing  Rs 
and Ci.  

Using these mechanisms, we prevent any illegal readers 
to  acquire  registered  tags’  identifiers  and  prevent  any 
silent  listeners  to  know  the  whole  identifiers  of  the  tags 
registered to the proxy device. 

 

 

 

 

 

4. Securities 

In  this  chapter,  we  analyze  the  proposed  device  and  its 
protocol in security point of view.  
 

A. Information leakage  

 

Firstly, we have to address whether this device and its 
protocol prevent to leak any information about tags. 
In  this  scheme,  an  eavesdropper  can  acquire  some 
bits of identifier. However, if the tag identifier is long 
enough, it is very difficult to be guessed by her. Now 
EPC  class  0  tag  use  64-bit  long  code  for  a  static 
identifier and EPC class 1 generation 2 tag, which is 
one of 18000-6 standards, uses 96-bit long code. It’s 
long enough to make difficult to guess tag’s identifier 
[7]. And an eavesdropper can also hear the message, 
a,  transmitted  from  the  proxy  device  to  the  reader. 
However, only the reader knows its own private key 
and  it  can  decrypt  the  message  a.  There  is  no 
information leakage in this case.  
 

B. Location Tracking  

 
Secondly,  we  need  to  check  whether  this  scheme 
prevents illegal location tracking. In this scheme, the 
same  tag  emits  the  same  static  identifier  on  every 
transaction,  but  the  proxy  device  broadcasts  always 
the  different  numbers.  Therefore  an  adversary  can’t 
trace the specific tag or its holder, because she can’t 
distinguish the tag from the others. 
 

C. Comparison in Security and on-tag Cost  

 
We should also consider tag’s hardware cost, which 
is  very  important  in  the  view  of  manufacturers  and 
RFID popularization. Table 1 shows existing privacy 
protection schemes’ security and their cost on the tag. 
Most  of  other  schemes  need  pretty  expensive 
hardware  modules  for  privacy  protection,  but  our 
proposed scheme need not to be changed on the tag 
hardware.  Therefore  our  scheme  satisfies  not  only 
security requirements but also cost requirements.

Summary 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system is now becoming 
widely  accepted  for  many  ubiquitous  computing  applications.  
However, RFID system has some privacy problems. Therefore, 
many researches results related to security and privacy in 
RFID  system.  However,  we  cannot  choose  anything  among 
them  for  applying  to  the  current  RFID  system.  Most  of  them 
require  either  of  high-cost  hardware  specification  or  giving  up 
potential convenience of consumers. In this paper, we propose a 
simple privacy protection scheme that can be used for the current 
existing RFID system such as ISO 18000-6 type C. We modify 
this standard tag identification protocol slightly and introduce a 
light-weight proxy device for privacy enhancing.

Key words:

The  main 
the  ubiquitous  computing 
application  is  RFID  system  that  recognizes  and  manages 
RFID tag through the RF (Radio Frequency) signal. Low-
cost  RFID  tags  can  be  read,  and  information  can  be 
updated without physical contact. Therefore, RFID system 
has  become  popular  for  automated  identification  in  the 
ubiquitous computing applications[15, 16].

Furthermore,  we  expect  that  RFID  technology  will  be 
the  next  one  of  the  bar-code  system  in  the  area  of 
automatic identification. It will be not only substitutes of 
the  existing  bar-code  applications,  but  also  pioneers  of 
new  creative  services  such  as  speedy  checkouts  in  the

come  true,  we  need  to  solve  some  problems,  which  are 
reducing  manufacturing  and  packaging  costs,  lowering 
tag’s  power  consumption,  standardization,  security,  and 
privacy problems. Thus, several methods of protecting the 
users' location privacy have been proposed [2-4, 8]. Now 
we  have  to  focus  on  its  privacy  problems  for  RFID

system’s popularization [1, 2].  

Normally a tag emits its unique identifier to any reader 
without any authentication phase. This characteristic is the 
origin of security  and privacy  problems in  RFID system. 
In the near future, that may be equipped by RFID, at any 
time the user will be able to know easily what kind of man 
someone  is,  just  using  user’s  RFID  reader  to  scan  his 
items [1-8]. Anyone who has lots of readers and a logging 
system will be able to retrieve location histories of us from 
his system [3-9].  

In  this  paper,  we  will  address  some  of  the  existing 
security  schemes  related  to  privacy  protection  and  also 
introduce the singulation protocol of ISO 18000-6 Type C 
before describing our scheme [10]. 

2. RFID System Overview 

2.1 EPC 

The binary representation of the EPC (Electronic Product 
Code),  a  combination  of  Header,  EPC  Manager,  Object 
Class,  and  Serial Number. Header  identifies  the  version, 
length, tag type, and structure of the code. EPC Manager 
identifies  a  company,  a  manager,  or  an  organization.  In 
short,  it  indicates  a  manufacturer  ID.  Object  Class 
indicates article classification (manufacturer's product ID). 
The  class  number  must  be  unique  for  all  given  domains. 
Serial Number is unique for every class and non-repeating 
for each object class code.  

The  figure  1  shows  the  EPC  and  figure  2  shows  EPC 

network.  

 
- Header  :  identifies  the  version,  length,  tag  type,  and 
structure of the code. The 64-bit type assigns 2-bit for 
the header field, whereas 96/256-bit types use an 8-bit 
header. 

- EPC  Manager  :  identifies  a  company,  a  manager,  or 
an  organization.  This  value  ensures  that  each  domain

number is unique. In short, it identifies the code of the 
manufacturer (e.g., Coca-Cola company). 

- Object Class : indicates article classification. The class 
number  must  be  unique  for  all  given  domains  (e.g., 
Coke 280ml can). 

- Serial  Number  :  unique  for  every  class  and  non-
repeating for each object class code (e.g.,  any unique 
Coke 280ml can).  

 

queries, the RFID tag transmits identification information 
such  as  an  ID,  to  the  RFID  reader  by  means  of  a  Radio 
Frequency  signal.  An  RFID  reader  known  as  transceiver 
or  interrogator.  The  reader  generally  consists  of  an  RF 
module, control unit, and coupling element to interrogate 
electronic  tags  via  RF  communication.  An  RFID  reader 
receives identification information from an RFID tag and 
subsequently  delivers  this  information 
to  the  RFID 
middleware. The RFID reader can read and write data on 
the RFID tags.  

The RFID tag is either an active or a passive tag. active 
tag possesses a battery and actively transmits information 
to the reader for communication. The passive tag must be 
inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader since 
RFID tags usually do not possess their own battery power 
supply. The EPC is stored on this tag. Tags communicate 
their EPCs to readers using a RF signal.

2.4 Information Service 

EPCIS  (EPC  Information  Services)  enables  users  to 
exchange  EPC-related  data  with  trading  partners  through 
the EPC Network. EPCIS provides EPC Network related 
data  available  in  PML  format  to  request  services.  Data 
available  through  the  EPCIS  may  include  tag  data 
collected  from  EPC  middleware  such  as  date  of 
manufacture, expiry date, and product information.

EPC  Middleware  manages  EPC  data  received  from  the 
reader,  provides  alerts,  and 
for 
communication to the EPCIS (EPC Information Services) 
or the company's other existing information systems. EPC 
is  developing  a  software  interface  standard  for  services 
enabling  data  exchange  between  an  EPC  reader  or 
network  of  readers  and 
information  systems.  EPC 
middleware  designed  to  process  the  stream  of  tag  data 
coming from one or more readers, and this particular piece 
of software manages readers. 

2.3 RFID tag and reader 

RFID systems are basically composed of tags and readers. 
An  RFID  tag,  also  known  as  a  transponder,  is  an  RFID 
device consisting of a microchip and antenna attached to a 
substrate. The microchip in the tag is used for data storage 
and logical operations, whereas the coiled antenna is used 
for communication with the reader. When the RFID reader

(ONS) is one component of Discovery Services[11]. The 
ONS  provides  a  global  lookup  service,  translating  EPCs 
into  one  or  more  Internet  Uniform  Reference  Locators 
(URLs),  where  further  information  regarding  the  object 
may be retrieved. In short, the ONS provides yellow page 
services  for  the  EPC  Network,  allowing  participants  to 
quickly  discover 
the  EPC  Network 
containing  the  information  associated  with  a  particular 
EPC.  The  ONS  works  same  as  Domain  Name  Service

2.6 Basic RFID System 

RFID systems are composed of three main elements: RFID 
tag,  RFID  reader,  and  back-end  database.  The  forward 
channel,  i.e.,  the  reader  to  the  tag,  is  assumed  to  be 
broadcast  with  an  RF  signal  that  can  do  long-range 
monitoring. On the other hand, the backward channel, i.e., 
the tag to the reader, is relatively much weaker, enabling 
monitoring only by eavesdroppers within the tag's shorter 
operating  range.  In  general,  it  is  assumed  that  eaves-
droppers can monitor only the forward channel undetected

As the data carrier in the RFID system, the RFID tag or 
transponder  includes  object-identifying  data.  Tags  are 
generally composed of an IC chip and an antenna. The IC 
chip  in  the  tag  is  used  for  data  storage  and  logical 
operations,  whereas  the  coiled  antenna  is  used  for 
communication  between  the  reader.  The  RFID  tag  may 
either  be  active  or  passive.  The  Active  tag  has  a  battery 
and  actively  sends  the  information  to  the  reader  for 
communication.  On  the  other  hand,  the  passive  tag  must 
be inductively powered from the RF signal of the reader. 
Both types of the tag begin to communicate when they are 
interrogated by the reader. In this paper, the passive type 
of RFID tag is considered. 
 

- RFID reader or transceiver is a device that sends an 
RF signal to the tag, receives the information from the 
tag,  and  sends  such  information  to  the  back-end 
database. The reader may read and write data to the tag. 
In general, readers are composed of the RF module, a 
control  unit,  and  a  coupling  element  to  interrogate 
electronic tags via RF communication. 

-  Back-end  database  is  the  data-processing  system  that 
stores  related  information  (e.g.,  product  information, 
tracking logs, reader location, etc) with a particular tag. 

3. Related Work 

Until  now  there  are  many  research  results  for  RFID 
privacy  protection,  but  we  introduce  only  three  of  them 
related to our proposing scheme directly.  

3.1 Blocker tag 

Juels’ blocker  tag which can be used as  a  shield  for  a 
customer’s tags [3,4]. RFID system normally has an anti-
collision  protocol  for  reading  multiple  tags.  The  blocker 
tag uses anti-collision protocols reversely for hiding tags. 
A blocker tag will make a collision whenever any reader 

 

tries to scan the tags inside its coverage. Consequently, the 
blocker tag is one of active jamming devices, and it can be 
used for illegal purposes such as theft. And it works with 
the tags inside its physical coverage, but not with the tags 
logically belonging to the customer.  

3.2 Using Proxy Device 

Another  approach  is  an  external  device  approach,  in 
which a customer uses a proxy device for protecting his or 
her privacy. There are three representative schemes in this 
approach;  Rieback’s  RFID  guardian  project[5],  Juels’ 
REP[6],  Kim’s  MARP[7],  and  Yeo’s  eMARP[8].  In  this 
approach, an external device serves as a proxy agent for its 
holder,  and  it  can  have  a  general  cryptographic  modules 
and  process  pretty  complicated  protocols.  And  proxy 
agents  seem  to  be  embedded  into  other  mobile  devices 
such  as  cellular  phones  and  PDA’s  in  the  near  future. 
However, there no regulations and standards related to this 
approach until now, so we need much time to apply these 
schemes to the current RFID systems.  

3.3 Backward Channel Protection Scheme 

Backward  channel  protection  scheme[9],  which  is  a 
simple and practical scheme and can be used in the current 
RFID systems. In this scheme, the reader’s action is very 
important.  A  reader  has  to  protect  the  tag’s  k-bit  static 
identifier which is in communication with the reader itself. 
The reader emits a k-bit random number at the same time 
when the tag emits its static identifier and then this action 
makes a collision eventually. The  reader can resolve this 
collision because it knows one number of the two collided 
numbers.  

the 

identifier 

tag’s  static 

However,  passive  attackers  can’t  resolve  this  collision 
and  can’t  know 
from 
eavesdropping  of  backward  channel  because  they  can’t 
distinguish  the  tag’s  identifier  from  the  reader’s  random 
number. Figure 4 show how this protocol works in detail. 
However,  if  a  reader  doesn’t  provide  this  protection 
scheme  or  an  active  attacker  try  to  communicate  tags 
directly,  the  tags  emit  their  static  identifier  without  any 
protection mechanisms.

3. Proposed Protocol 

We propose a simple proxy device between reader and tag, 
and  this  device  is  controlled  by  a  customer.  A  customer 
uses this proxy device for her privacy protection  and for 
preventing  unauthorized  tag  scanning  by  attackers.  Our 
proxy  device  protects  all  of  registered  tag  in  its  radio 
signal  coverage.  It  should  be  able  to  connect  to  public 
certificate authorities for verifying reader’s public key or 
have an authenticated readers’ public key list.  

In  the  case  that  a  customer  doesn’t  have  any  proxy 
device  or  doesn’t  turn  on  her  proxy  device,  the  current 
standard  RFID  protocols  are  used  and  any  tags  of  the 
customer  can’t  be  protected  from  all  attacks.  In  the  case 
that a customer turns on her proxy device, we have to use 
a new protocol, which can be simply added to the current 
standard protocols, especially to ISO 18000-6 type C[10].  
Figure 5 shows an example of this standard protocol. In 
this slotted  random  anti-collision,  tags  load  a  random  ID 
into  a  slot  counter,  decrement  this  slot  counter  based  on 
Interrogator commands, and reply to the Interrogator when 
their  slot  counter  reaches  zero.  However,  this  standard 
protocol has a big privacy problem that any readers in the 
radio-frequency range can hear the unique ID of the  tag, 
EPC code. 
 

Fig. 5  An operating example of ISO 18000-6 type C. 

 

 

Our overall protocol can be categorized to four phases; 
tag  registration  phase,  tag  identifying  phase,  resolving 
phase  for  unregistered  tags,  and  resolving  phase  for 
registered tags.  

 
A. Registration phase  
 

1. a customer has to register her all tags to her proxy 

device with their static identifiers.  

2. After registration, the proxy device stores all static 
identifiers  of  customers’  tags  into  its  non-volatile 
memory.  (we  assume  that  the  registration  phase 
should be done in secure environment without any 
threats  and  we  assume 
there  are  some 
unregistered  tags  in  the  proxy  device’s  radio 
frequency range.)  

that 

3. The  latter  assumption  makes  our  scheme  more 
user-controllable than Juels’ blocker tag scheme[3], 
in which a blocker tag blocks all of the tags in its 

 

communication coverage, but not depending on the 
customer’s controlling.  

 
B. Tag identifying phase  
 

1. the reader and the tags follows the standard RFID 
protocols,  but  the  proxy  device  do  something  for 
protecting registered tags’ identifier.  

2. After  a  singulation  step,  the  reader  send  ACK 
message  to  the  selected  tag  for  getting  the  tag’s 
real static identifier.  

3. The  tag  sends  its  static  IDi  to  the  reader.  At  the 
exact  same  time  to  the  tag’s  response,  the  proxy 
device sends a random number Ri to the reader.  

4. The proxy device sends different random numbers 
Ri to the reader at the same time to each tag’s IDi 
response.  The  proxy  device  stores  its  all  random 
numbers  for  all  tags  which  were  scanned  by  the 
reader and it  can  resolve  the real  static  identifiers 
of all tags because it knows all collision bit strings 
and its own random numbers which were used for 
making collisions.  

In  the  eavesdropper’s  view,  he  can  hear  only 
collision  bit  string  and  he  can  know  only  some  bits 
which  are  not  collided  on  every  tag  identification 
steps.  This  situation  happens  to  the  reader  equally. 
The reader cannot resolve any identifiers of scanned 
tags, but it stores all collision bit strings, Ci, into its 
memory.

C. Resolving phase for unregistered tags 
 
In  this  phase,  the  reader  requests  the  proxy  device  to 
send  the  set  of  random  numbers  that  were  used  for 
unregistered tags.

1. The proxy device knows all of its random numbers 
that  were  used  for  making  collision  and  all 
identifiers  of  tags  that  were  involved  in  the  prior 
phase.  

2. The  proxy  also  may  know  which  numbers  were 
used  for  unregistered  tags  because  it  has  the 
registered tag list.  

3. Then,  we  can  define  Ru  as  the  set  of  random 

numbers for unregistered tags.  

4. The  proxy  device  sends  Ru  to  the  reader  without 
authentication because we think that “unregistered” 
means “unprotected” in the view of customers.  

5. The  reader  can  resolve  the  unregistered  tags’ 

identifiers from comparing Ru and Ci.  

 
D. Resolving phase for registered tags 
 

1. The  reader  requests  the  proxy  device  to  send  Rs, 
the  set  of  random  number  random  numbers  that 
were used for unregistered tags.  

2. For  completing  this  phase,  the  reader  has  its  own 
public key with a valid registered certificate and it 
sends the certificate to the proxy device.  

3. After  receiving  the  certificate  of  the  reader,  the 

proxy device check whether it is valid or not.  

4. A  valid  certificate  means  that  the  reader  is 

authenticated and registered one.  

We  don’t  want  to  fix  the  method  for  checking  the 
validity of the certificate in this scheme. However, it will 
be a possible method that the proxy device does an on-line 
transaction  with  a  public  certificate  authority,  CA,  for 
checking the reader’s validity.  

If the proxy device should work in off-line environment, 
it is possible to manage the authenticated readers list and 
their  public  key  list  that  may  be  updated  regularly. 
Anyway,  

5. after  the  proxy  device  check  the  validity  of  the 
reader  and  the  reader’s  public  key,  the  proxy 
device encrypt Rs with the reader’s public key, KRd 
and  then  send  the  encrypted  message,  a,  to  the 
reader. 

6. The reader can decrypt the message a with its own 
private key, KRe. Eventually, the reader can resolve 
the  registered  tags’  identifiers  from  comparing  Rs 
and Ci.  

Using these mechanisms, we prevent any illegal readers 
to  acquire  registered  tags’  identifiers  and  prevent  any 
silent  listeners  to  know  the  whole  identifiers  of  the  tags 
registered to the proxy device. 

 

 

 

 

 

4. Securities 

In  this  chapter,  we  analyze  the  proposed  device  and  its 
protocol in security point of view.  
 

A. Information leakage  

 

Firstly, we have to address whether this device and its 
protocol prevent to leak any information about tags. 
In  this  scheme,  an  eavesdropper  can  acquire  some 
bits of identifier. However, if the tag identifier is long 
enough, it is very difficult to be guessed by her. Now 
EPC  class  0  tag  use  64-bit  long  code  for  a  static 
identifier and EPC class 1 generation 2 tag, which is 
one of 18000-6 standards, uses 96-bit long code. It’s 
long enough to make difficult to guess tag’s identifier 
[7]. And an eavesdropper can also hear the message, 
a,  transmitted  from  the  proxy  device  to  the  reader. 
However, only the reader knows its own private key 
and  it  can  decrypt  the  message  a.  There  is  no 
information leakage in this case.  
 

B. Location Tracking  

 
Secondly,  we  need  to  check  whether  this  scheme 
prevents illegal location tracking. In this scheme, the 
same  tag  emits  the  same  static  identifier  on  every 
transaction,  but  the  proxy  device  broadcasts  always 
the  different  numbers.  Therefore  an  adversary  can’t 
trace the specific tag or its holder, because she can’t 
distinguish the tag from the others. 
 

C. Comparison in Security and on-tag Cost  

 
We should also consider tag’s hardware cost, which 
is  very  important  in  the  view  of  manufacturers  and 
RFID popularization. Table 1 shows existing privacy 
protection schemes’ security and their cost on the tag. 
Most  of  other  schemes  need  pretty  expensive 
hardware  modules  for  privacy  protection,  but  our 
proposed scheme need not to be changed on the tag 
hardware.  Therefore  our  scheme  satisfies  not  only 
security requirements but also cost requirements.

5. Conclusions 

RFID system has become an important technology in the 
ubiquitous  environment.  While  RFID  system  brings  an 
idea  to  fruition,  we  must  consider  their  security  and 
privacy problems. In particular, although the RFID system 
enables  the  logistics  management  to  prevent  theft  and 
imitations  effectively,  it  may  also  allow  access  to  users’ 
private information such as credit information or purchase 
patterns without their agreement. 

Therefore, we proposed a new simple proxy device and 
a  protocol,  which  can  be  added  to  the  current  existing 
RFID  system  such  as  EPC  class  1  generation  2,  ISO 
18000-6 type C. Our scheme offers a customer to register 
her  tags  to  her  small  proxy  device  for  preventing  her 
privacy  and  location  information.  This  scheme  can  be 
adopted  for  the  current  RFID  standard  system  with  only 
slight  change  on  the  reader,  not  on  the  tag.  We  are  sure 
that it will be cost-effective for RFID tag manufacturer.
