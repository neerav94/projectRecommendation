Abstract- This paper contains the campus security tracking system (CST) has been designed and implemented using the 
RFID and ZigBee network. The CST reads the RFID tags data through FRID & ZigBee node, and then sends it to PC node 
by a custom wireless protocol on the ZigBee. PC node gives related warning (or) hints by the result of matching master slave 
RFID  tag  information.  When  the  warning  occurs,  its  user  can  logon  the  web  system  to  get  the  real-time  tracking  for 
valuables with embedded slave RFID where the thief arrives at any one access control node, it would be blocked. User can 
also manage his own valuables such as lending and recovery operation through the Web manager center. The system can 
achieve large-scale logistics management and tracking, and has good market prospects and value in use.

two-way  data 
Where  ZigBee  module  provides 
transmission  services  and  returns  the  corresponding 
control information after passing center node and PC 
processing.  Control  information  is  sent  to  micro-
processor  through  ZigBee  communication  module. 
And  the  system  can  give  the  corresponding  early 
warning tips if the ZigBee module has early warning 
capability (such as entrance guard). 
 
B.  Wireless transmission 
The  system  uses  ZigBee  to  build  transmission 
network, which is used for the transmission of sensor 
data,  and  uses  customized  wireless  transmission 
protocol, which is designed  based on simplicity and 
reliability.  In  the  protocol,  considering  simplifying 
microcontroller  functions  of  RFID  &  ZigBee  node 
and  reducing  system  cost,  the  wireless  transmission 
protocol  mainly  achieves  the  capabilities  of  error 
checking, data framing, conflict mechanisms such as 
retransmission, etc. As for error control, considering 
that tag data is usually short , the microcontroller of 
FRID &  ZigBee nodes have strong logic computing 
power,  so  the  original  CRC  operation  is  relatively 
complex    and  not  suitable  for  the  micro-processor. 
Therefore, this system innovatively uses new type of 
customized check method: uses and, or, xor operation 
for error control, along with length check, and insert 
frame  boundary  FLAG  into  the  data  frame  when 
sending it. 
 
Assuming  the  data  to  be  sent  is  SD~S  and  source 
address(one  char),  destination  address(one  char), 
sequence  number(one  char),  date  length(one  char), 
checksum(four char) will be sent with data, as shown 
in Figure.2(ACK is the same as described above, data 
section is null, L=0).

C1 = S    D    Seq    L    So    ----.    Sn-1 
 
Where  the  checksum  section  provides  4  check 
methods, besides and, or, xor operation, it allows use 
of  customized  method  ,where  00  means  null.  The 
sequence  number  is  mainly  used  to  prevent  the 
additional  overhead  of 
the 
transmitter,  the  following  steps  are  taken  when 
sending data. 
 
1.   Get  the  data  from  the  upper  layer  packed,  add 
source  address,  destination  address,  sequence 
number, date length, checksum to it, then send it

3.   Return true if receive ACK. If timeout happens,

The tag information obtained by RFID&ZigBee node 
is  transmitted  through  ZigBee  network,  and  sent  to 
PC node at last. In this system, PC node gets the data 
of the ZigBee network through serial ports, parses out 
the  tag  information  through  customized  ZigBee 
protocol.  PC  node  gives  the  matched  results  by 
querying 
the 
database,  and  returns 
the  corresponding  results 
through the wireless module. When the incoming tag 
information  doesn’t  match,  PC  node  will  give 
warning  message,  pass  the  warning  and  control 
message 
the 
corresponding  owner.  In  the  multi-service  platform, 
users can view the location of their valuables through 
multi-service platform interface. When valuables are 
lost,  users  can  find  the  course  of  corresponding 
valuables through web, so as for tracking and getting 
it  back.  Multi-service  platform  only  gives  prompts 
warning  case  in  this  system,  but  in  real  life  it  can 
achieve  anti-theft  and  monitoring  work  through 
functions  reservation  and  system  interface.  Specific

the system greatly. When the RFID sensor network is 
more widespread, it will greatly improve the tracking 
range of items.

A.   Layout of sensor network 
Implement  RFID  &  ZigBee  sensor  network  layout 
within  the  campus,  finish  transmission  through  the 
ZigBee  protocol,  set  those  important  nodes(such  as 
the  campus  house  door,  the  dormitory  door)as  PC 
nodes,  which  are  database  maintenance,  WEB 
maintenance,  RFID  information  processing  servers. 
And all PC nodes are connected by Metropolitan area 
networks(MAN).  After  applying  for  services,  user 
can get a RFID (Master) tag as a sign of the owner 
and multiple RFID (slave) tags as signs of valuables. 
Insert RFID (slave) tag in valuables, and this system 
can achieve the capability of anti-theft and track lost 
valuables  within  the  scope  of  monitoring.  Below  is

On the other hand, microcontroller in the location of 
access  control  should  receive  message  from  the 
computer  and  give 
the  prompt  warning  when 
mismatched RFID tag passes the system Overall, the 
workflow  of  the  system  can  be  described  by  the 
following steps. 
 
1.  RFID  &  ZigBee  nodes  sense 

the  RFID 
(master/slave)labels,  send  information  in  the 
labels to the ZigBee network real time, which is 
then transferred to the PC nodes. PC checks the 
label  information  in  the  database,  when  master 
label and slave label match or only master label 
appears  the  system  recognizes  it  as  legal  input. 
But  when  only  slave  label  appears  or  master 
label  and  slave  label  don’t  match,  the  system 
recognize it as illegal input, then go to step 2. 

2.   Record the position changes of RFID (slave) the 
tags, track  the  slave  tags,  and  show  warning  at 
PC nodes. Then query the database, look for the 
owner of items and send confirming information 
to the owner through the system.

Abstract- This paper contains the campus security tracking system (CST) has been designed and implemented using the 
RFID and ZigBee network. The CST reads the RFID tags data through FRID & ZigBee node, and then sends it to PC node 
by a custom wireless protocol on the ZigBee. PC node gives related warning (or) hints by the result of matching master slave 
RFID  tag  information.  When  the  warning  occurs,  its  user  can  logon  the  web  system  to  get  the  real-time  tracking  for 
valuables with embedded slave RFID where the thief arrives at any one access control node, it would be blocked. User can 
also manage his own valuables such as lending and recovery operation through the Web manager center. The system can 
achieve large-scale logistics management and tracking, and has good market prospects and value in use. 
 
 
I. 
 
As  the  number  of  valuables  owned  by  college 
students  increases,  means  of  criminal theft  becomes 
more  intelligent  and  hidden.  But  students’  security 
awareness 
in 
frequent campus thefts and has bad effect on teachers, 
students  and  the  society.  To  solve  the  problem,  we 
design an intelligent campus security tracking system 
based on RFID and ZigBee, which has full range of 
protection  on  campus  that has  small  flow  of  people 
and wiring is not convenient. 
 
RFID 
,which 
identifies  targets  within  the  target  area  and  obtains 
relevant  data  automatically  through  RF  signals,  has 
become  welcomed  by  people  gradually  since  it  has 
been  proposed.  The  recognition  process  can  resist 
harsh  environments  without  human  intervention. 
Based on the technology characteristics and strength 
of  RFID,  we  combine  RFID  and  campus  security 
tracking system, and use SCM control technology and 
wireless  network 
to  develop  an 
intelligent 
system  with  networking 
capability. That’s to say, combine RFID and ZigBee 
to  build  a  wireless  network  which  doesn’t  need 
rewiring.  And 
its  special  high  efficiency  and 
convenience will reduce the cost of campus security 
and  make  campus  safer,  which  will  reduce  the 
fluency  of  campus  theft  effectively  and  benefit 
students and teachers. 
 
Based  on  RFID  and  ZigBee,  the  intelligent  campus 
security  tracking  system  uses  physical  methods  and 
electronic  technology,  automatically  detects  theft  in 
monitoring areas, generates alarm signals, and tracks 
targets  through  the  detection  point  of  RFID.  Anti-
theft alarm system is important facility to prevent  
 
 
robbery, 
the  event  of 
emergency, it can show the accurate scene in security 

 
The  intelligent  campus  security  tracking  system  is 
based  on  wireless  communication  services  between 
nodes  provided  by  RFID  sensors  and  ZigBee,  and 
identifies the RFID tags within the region to prevent 
thefts  and  track  valuables,  so  as  to  protect  the 
property of the teachers and students. 
 
A.  RFID&ZigBee nodes implementation 
As 
technology 
the  popularity  of  RFID  sensor 
increases,  RFID  tags  are  cheap,  and  can  be  reused. 
Data  transmission  is  convenient  and  easy,  we  can 
deal  with  tags  in  accordance  with  Customized 
encryption  algorithm  based  on  user  requests.  Then 
combine  RFID  sensor  with  ZigBee(referred  to  as 
RFID & ZigBee later) ,and complete the sensor node 
data collection work. Transceiver inducts RFID tags, 
sends the Information of the read tags to the micro-
controller 
to 
RS232  transmission  protocol.  The  micro-processor 
sends  the  data  to  wireless  module  to  complete  data 
transmission  after  simply  data  processing,  as  shown 
in Figure.1.

two-way  data 
Where  ZigBee  module  provides 
transmission  services  and  returns  the  corresponding 
control information after passing center node and PC 
processing.  Control  information  is  sent  to  micro-
processor  through  ZigBee  communication  module. 
And  the  system  can  give  the  corresponding  early 
warning tips if the ZigBee module has early warning 
capability (such as entrance guard). 
 
B.  Wireless transmission 
The  system  uses  ZigBee  to  build  transmission 
network, which is used for the transmission of sensor 
data,  and  uses  customized  wireless  transmission 
protocol, which is designed  based on simplicity and 
reliability.  In  the  protocol,  considering  simplifying 
microcontroller  functions  of  RFID  &  ZigBee  node 
and  reducing  system  cost,  the  wireless  transmission 
protocol  mainly  achieves  the  capabilities  of  error 
checking, data framing, conflict mechanisms such as 
retransmission, etc. As for error control, considering 
that tag data is usually short , the microcontroller of 
FRID &  ZigBee nodes have strong logic computing 
power,  so  the  original  CRC  operation  is  relatively 
complex    and  not  suitable  for  the  micro-processor. 
Therefore, this system innovatively uses new type of 
customized check method: uses and, or, xor operation 
for error control, along with length check, and insert 
frame  boundary  FLAG  into  the  data  frame  when 
sending it. 
 
Assuming  the  data  to  be  sent  is  SD~S  and  source 
address(one  char),  destination  address(one  char), 
sequence  number(one  char),  date  length(one  char), 
checksum(four char) will be sent with data, as shown 
in Figure.2(ACK is the same as described above, data 
section is null, L=0).

C1 = S    D    Seq    L    So    ----.    Sn-1 
 
Where  the  checksum  section  provides  4  check 
methods, besides and, or, xor operation, it allows use 
of  customized  method  ,where  00  means  null.  The 
sequence  number  is  mainly  used  to  prevent  the 
additional  overhead  of 
the 
transmitter,  the  following  steps  are  taken  when 
sending data. 
 
1.   Get  the  data  from  the  upper  layer  packed,  add

3.   Return true if receive ACK. If timeout happens, 
and timeout time is less than the maximum time,

C.  PCnode centre and multi-service platform 
 
The tag information obtained by RFID&ZigBee node 
is  transmitted  through  ZigBee  network,  and  sent  to 
PC node at last. In this system, PC node gets the data 
of the ZigBee network through serial ports, parses out 
the  tag  information  through  customized  ZigBee 
protocol.  PC  node  gives  the  matched  results  by 
querying 
the 
database,  and  returns 
the  corresponding  results 
through the wireless module. When the incoming tag 
information  doesn’t  match,  PC  node  will  give 
warning  message,  pass  the  warning  and  control 
message 
the 
corresponding  owner.  In  the  multi-service  platform, 
users can view the location of their valuables through 
multi-service platform interface. When valuables are 
lost,  users  can  find  the  course  of  corresponding 
valuables through web, so as for tracking and getting 
it  back.  Multi-service  platform  only  gives  prompts 
warning  case  in  this  system,  but  in  real  life  it  can 
achieve  anti-theft  and  monitoring  work  through 
functions  reservation  and  system  interface.  Specific 
functions design is shown in Figure.3

for the web form of information display platform, it’s 
also  expected  to  use  the  campus  thumbnails,  and

As shown in figure.5, the whole system includes two 
levels  design:  hardware  and  software.  Hardware 
includes  RFID 
readers  and  ZigBee  wireless 
transmission module, and actually microcontroller of 
FRID & ZigBee nodes are responsible for connecting 
those two. On the one hand, read the RFID tag data 
within the RFID reader sensor area, and then send it 
to  PC  node

networks(MAN), thus improving the compatibility of 
the system greatly. When the RFID sensor network is 
more widespread, it will greatly improve the tracking 
range of items. 
 
III.  SYSTEM DESIGN AND 
 
 
A.   Layout of sensor network 
Implement  RFID  &  ZigBee  sensor  network  layout 
within  the  campus,  finish  transmission  through  the 
ZigBee  protocol,  set  those  important  nodes(such  as 
the  campus  house  door,  the  dormitory  door)as  PC 
nodes,  which  are  database  maintenance,  WEB 
maintenance,  RFID  information  processing  servers. 
And all PC nodes are connected by Metropolitan area 
networks(MAN).  After  applying  for  services,  user 
can get a RFID (Master) tag as a sign of the owner 
and multiple RFID (slave) tags as signs of valuables. 
Insert RFID (slave) tag in valuables, and this system 
can achieve the capability of anti-theft and track lost 
valuables  within  the  scope  of  monitoring.  Below  is 
the  campus  sensor  network  layout  in  simulation 
environment.  Set  the  PC-nodes  in  the  dormitory, 
classroom building (there exists entrance guard at the 
location  of  PC  nodes,  when master  RFID  and  slave 
RFID  don’t  match,  a  warning  will  be  sent.).In  real 
life,  RFID  &  ZigBee  nodes  should  be  set  on  the 
campus as evenly as possible.

On the other hand, microcontroller in the location of 
access  control  should  receive  message  from  the 
computer  and  give 
the  prompt  warning  when 
mismatched RFID tag passes the system Overall, the 
workflow  of  the  system  can  be  described  by  the 
following steps. 
 
1.  RFID  &  ZigBee  nodes  sense 

the  RFID 
(master/slave)labels,  send  information  in  the 
labels to the ZigBee network real time, which is 
then transferred to the PC nodes. PC checks the 
label  information  in  the  database,  when  master 
label and slave label match or only master label 
appears  the  system  recognizes  it  as  legal  input. 
But  when  only  slave  label  appears  or  master 
label  and  slave  label  don’t  match,  the  system 
recognize it as illegal input, then go to step 2. 

2.   Record the position changes of RFID (slave) the 
tags, track  the  slave  tags,  and  show  warning  at 
PC nodes. Then query the database, look for the 
owner of items and send confirming information 
to the owner through the system.

achieve  the  collection  and  processing  of  server 
information  and  database  maintenance  and  query. 
There is alarm system in front of every door, once it

3.   The owner logins WEB to search for items. He 
can  see  the  real-time  location  of  his  valuables 
according  to  the  hints.  After  confirmation,  the 
valuables will be stopped at the entrance guard. 
As  for  false  information,  the  owner  can  cancel 
this warning. 

 
IV.  TEST RESULT ANALYSIS 
 
In practice, our system’s sensor network uses Middle 
distance RFID reader, SZ05-STD wireless  
ZigBee,  standard  RS232,  and  the  mc9s12xs128  of 
FreeScale  as  microcontroller  of  FRID  &  ZigBee 
node,  .and  uses  Pentium(4)  in  the  XP  operation 
system  to  do  a  small-scale  tracking  and  system 
verification. In order to save experiment cost, we use 
simulation  method  to  achieve  large-scale  test  and 
verification of our sensor network. The simulation in 
the  experiment  only  replaces  the  process  of  reading 
the RFID tag information, and PC directly simulates 
the actual tag data acquisition process. 
 
As shown in Figure .6, the system detects an illegal 
input, and produces early warning information. After 
receiving  a  reminder,  user  logs  on  the  system  and 
sees the following warning tips. From the figure, we 
can see that it’s supported to lend his items to others 
to enable the daily use of items, so that this warning 
is cancelled. He can have his items back through this 
system, too. 
 

at  the  entrance  guard  so  as  to  achieve  security  and 
tracking purposes.

V.   CONCLUSION 
 
This  system  studies  campus  safety  and  security.  By 
identifying the tags information of master and slave 
RFID,  it  not  only  achieves  tracking  valuables  real 
time and giving early warning, but also supports users 
to  view  the  state  of  their  valuables,  and  lend  their 
valuables 
to  others.  As  people's  awareness  of 
property safety improves, the system can also provide 
personnel tracking feature to support services related 
to 
further 
popularization  of  sensor  networks,  the  system  can 
achieve 
logistics  management  and 
tracking, and has good market prospects and value in 
use.

power,  so  the  original  CRC  operation  is  relatively 
complex    and  not  suitable  for  the  micro-processor. 
Therefore, this system innovatively uses new type of 
customized check method: uses and, or, xor operation 
for error control, along with length check, and insert 
frame  boundary  FLAG  into  the  data  frame  when 
sending it. 
 
Assuming  the  data  to  be  sent  is  SD~S  and  source 
address(one  char),  destination  address(one  char), 
sequence  number(one  char),  date  length(one  char), 
checksum(four char) will be sent with data, as shown 
in Figure.2(ACK is the same as described above, data 
section is null, L=0).

Where  the  checksum  section  provides  4  check 
methods, besides and, or, xor operation, it allows use 
of  customized  method  ,where  00  means  null.  The 
sequence  number  is  mainly  used  to  prevent  the 
additional  overhead  of 
the

sending data. 
 
1.   Get  the  data  from  the  upper  layer  packed,  add

number, date length, checksum to it, then send it

front of it. After transmission, start the timer. Go 
to step 3. 

3.   Return true if receive ACK. If timeout happens,

C.  PCnode centre and multi-service platform 
 
The tag information obtained by RFID&ZigBee node 
is  transmitted  through  ZigBee  network,  and  sent  to 
PC node at last. In this system, PC node gets the data 
of the ZigBee network through serial ports, parses out 
the  tag  information  through  customized  ZigBee 
protocol.  PC  node  gives  the  matched  results  by 
querying 
the 
database,  and  returns 
the  corresponding  results 
through the wireless module. When the incoming tag 
information  doesn’t  match,  PC  node  will  give 
warning  message,  pass  the  warning  and  control 
message 
the 
corresponding  owner.  In  the  multi-service  platform, 
users can view the location of their valuables through 
multi-service platform interface. When valuables are 
lost,  users  can  find  the  course  of  corresponding 
valuables through web, so as for tracking and getting 
it  back.  Multi-service  platform  only  gives  prompts 
warning  case  in  this  system,  but  in  real  life  it  can 
achieve  anti-theft  and  monitoring  work  through 
functions  reservation  and  system  interface.  Specific 
functions design is shown in Figure.3

for the web form of information display platform, it’s 
also  expected  to  use  the  campus  thumbnails,  and 
words  describe  the  specific  location  of  searched 
valuables simultaneously. 
 
B.   System Architecture and flow chart 
As shown in figure.5, the whole system includes two 
levels  design:  hardware  and  software.  Hardware 
includes  RFID 
readers  and  ZigBee  wireless 
transmission module, and actually microcontroller of 
FRID & ZigBee nodes are responsible for connecting 
those two. On the one hand, read the RFID tag data 
within the RFID reader sensor area, and then send it 
to  PC  node

IMPLEMENTATION 

As  can  be  seen  from  Figure.3,  each  PC  node  is 
connected 
area 
networks(MAN), thus improving the compatibility of 
the system greatly. When the RFID sensor network is 
more widespread, it will greatly improve the tracking 
range of items. 
 
III.  SYSTEM DESIGN AND 
 
 
A.   Layout of sensor network 
Implement  RFID  &  ZigBee  sensor  network  layout 
within  the  campus,  finish  transmission  through  the 
ZigBee  protocol,  set  those  important  nodes(such  as 
the  campus  house  door,  the  dormitory  door)as  PC 
nodes,  which  are  database  maintenance,  WEB 
maintenance,  RFID  information  processing  servers. 
And all PC nodes are connected by Metropolitan area 
networks(MAN).  After  applying  for  services,  user 
can get a RFID (Master) tag as a sign of the owner 
and multiple RFID (slave) tags as signs of valuables. 
Insert RFID (slave) tag in valuables, and this system 
can achieve the capability of anti-theft and track lost 
valuables  within  the  scope  of  monitoring.  Below  is 
the  campus  sensor  network  layout  in  simulation 
environment.  Set  the  PC-nodes  in  the  dormitory, 
classroom building (there exists entrance guard at the 
location  of  PC  nodes,  when master  RFID  and  slave 
RFID  don’t  match,  a  warning  will  be  sent.).In  real 
life,  RFID  &  ZigBee  nodes  should  be  set  on  the 
campus as evenly as possible. 

 

 

Fig. 5 System Architecture chart 

 
On the other hand, microcontroller in the location of 
access  control  should  receive  message  from  the 
computer  and  give 
the  prompt  warning  when 
mismatched RFID tag passes the system Overall, the 
workflow  of  the  system  can  be  described  by  the 
following steps. 
 
1.  RFID  &  ZigBee  nodes  sense 

the  RFID 
(master/slave)labels,  send  information  in  the 
labels to the ZigBee network real time, which is 
then transferred to the PC nodes. PC checks the 
label  information  in  the  database,  when  master 
label and slave label match or only master label 
appears  the  system  recognizes  it  as  legal  input. 
But  when  only  slave  label  appears  or  master 
label  and  slave  label  don’t  match,  the  system 
recognize it as illegal input, then go to step 2. 

2.   Record the position changes of RFID (slave) the 
tags, track  the  slave  tags,  and  show  warning  at 
PC nodes. Then query the database, look for the 
owner of items and send confirming information 
to the owner through the system. 

 

Fig..4 : Campus sensor network layout 

 
As  shown  in  Figure  .4,  there  are  ZigBee  &  RFID 
nodes  and  PC  nodes  on  the  campus,  achieving  the 
"Internet  of  Things”  on  the  campus.  PC  nodes 
achieve  the  collection  and  processing  of  server 
information  and  database  maintenance  and  query. 
There is alarm system in front of every door, once it 
finds that master RFID and slave RFID don’t match, 
it’ll give an alarm immediately and inform guards. As

3.   The owner logins WEB to search for items. He 
can  see  the  real-time  location  of  his  valuables 
according  to  the  hints.  After  confirmation,  the 
valuables will be stopped at the entrance guard. 
As  for  false  information,  the  owner  can  cancel 
this warning. 

 
IV.  TEST RESULT ANALYSIS 
 
In practice, our system’s sensor network uses Middle 
distance RFID reader, SZ05-STD wireless  
ZigBee,  standard  RS232,  and  the  mc9s12xs128  of 
FreeScale  as  microcontroller  of  FRID  &  ZigBee 
node,  .and  uses  Pentium(4)  in  the  XP  operation 
system  to  do  a  small-scale  tracking  and  system 
verification. In order to save experiment cost, we use 
simulation  method  to  achieve  large-scale  test  and 
verification of our sensor network. The simulation in 
the  experiment  only  replaces  the  process  of  reading 
the RFID tag information, and PC directly simulates 
the actual tag data acquisition process. 
 
As shown in Figure .6, the system detects an illegal 
input, and produces early warning information. After 
receiving  a  reminder,  user  logs  on  the  system  and 
sees the following warning tips. From the figure, we 
can see that it’s supported to lend his items to others 
to enable the daily use of items, so that this warning 
is cancelled. He can have his items back through this 
system, too. 
 

at  the  entrance  guard  so  as  to  achieve  security  and 
tracking purposes.

V.   CONCLUSION 
 
This  system  studies  campus  safety  and  security.  By 
identifying the tags information of master and slave 
RFID,  it  not  only  achieves  tracking  valuables  real 
time and giving early warning, but also supports users 
to  view  the  state  of  their  valuables,  and  lend  their 
valuables 
to  others.  As  people's  awareness  of 
property safety improves, the system can also provide 
personnel tracking feature to support services related 
to 
further 
popularization  of  sensor  networks,  the  system  can 
achieve 
logistics  management  and 
tracking, and has good market prospects and value in 
use.
