Today in the current global scenario, the prime question in every girl’s mind, taking into account the ever rising increase of issues 
on women harassment in recent past, is only about her safety and security.  The only thought haunting every girl is when they will 
be  able  to  move  freely  on  the  streets  even  in  odd  hours  without  worrying  about  their  security.  This  paper  suggests  a  new 
perspective to use technology to protect women. The system resembles a normal belt which when activated, tracks the location of 
the  victim  using  GPS  (Global  Positioning  System)  and  sends  emergency  messages  using  GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile 
communication), to three emergency contacts and the police control room. The system also incorporates a screaming alarm that 
uses  real-time  clock,  to  call out  for help and  also generates an electric shock to injure  the attacker for  self defense. The main 
advantage of this system is that the user does not require a Smartphone unlike other applications that have been developed earlier. 
The use of sophisticated components ensures accuracy  and makes it reliable.  The belt provides with all the features  which will 
leave no stone unturned to help the victim in any kind of emergency situations.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The status of women in India has gone through many great changes over the past few millennia. From equal status with 
men in ancient times through the low points of the medieval period to the promotion of equal rights[6] by many reformers, 
the history of women in India has been eventful. In modern India, women have adorned high offices in India including 
that of the President, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, women in India 
continue  to  face  social  challenges  and  are  often  victims  of  abuse and violent  crimes[6] and, according to a global  poll 
conducted  by  Thomson  Reuters,  India  is  the  “fourth most  dangerous country” in  the world for women, and the worst 
country for women among the G20 countries. 
This paper focuses on a security system that is designed solely to serve the purpose of providing security[7] to women so 
that they never feel helpless while facing such social challenges. The system consists of various modules such as GSM 
shield (SIM 900A), Arduino ATMega328 board, GPS (GY-GPS6MV2), screaming alarm (APR 9600), a set of pressure 
sensors for activation and power supply unit. 
The Delhi Nirbhaya case that triggered the whole nation was the greatest motivation for this system. It was high time we 
women needed a change. 
 
2. Existing System 
Keeping the same concern in mind many developers have come up with innovative applications. Few of such applications 
are as follows- 
1. VithU app: This is an emergency app initiated by a popular Indian crime television series “Gumrah” aired on Channel 
[V]. In this app when the power button of the Smartphone is pressed twice consecutively, it will begin sending out alert 
messages with a link to the location of the user every two minutes to the contacts fed into the app. 
2. SHE (Society Harnessing Equipment) : It is a garment designed by three engineers from Chennai. This garment has an 
electric circuit that can generate 3800kv of current which can help the victim to escape.  
In case of multiple attacks it can send upto 82 electric shocks. Since the fabric is bilayer, the user is not affected. It can 
also send emergency messages. 
3. ILA security: The co-founders of this system, McGivern, James Phillips, and Neil Munn , have designed three personal 
alarms that can shock and disorient potential attackers and draw attention to dangerous situations. 
 
3.  Proposed Design 
The  proposed  system  is  to  design  a  portable  device  which  resembles  a  normal  belt.  It  consists  of  Arduino  Board, 
GSM/GPS modules, screaming alarm and pressure sensors. When the threshold of the pressure sensor crosses, the device 
will  get  activated  automatically.  Immediately  the  location  of  the  victim  [3]  will  be  tracked  with  the  help  of  GPS  and 
emergency  messages  will  be  sent  to  three  contacts  and  one  to  police  control  room  every  two  minutes  with  updated 
location.  The  screaming  alarm  unit  will  be  activated  and  will  send  out  sirens to call out for help.  The system is also 
capable to generate an electric shock to harm the attacker which may help the victim [8] to escape.

3. GPS Module: This is a GPS Receiver (5V Serial) with high gain having 4 Pin 2.54mm pitch strip. The third generation 
POT  (Patch  Antenna  on  Top)  is  used  by  the  reciever  for  the  GPS  module.  It  can  be  interfaced  with  normal  5V 
Microcontrollers with the help of the in built 3V-5V converter. The interfacing is made easier with the help of low pin 
count (4 pin) strip. The 4 Pins are 5V, TX, RX, and GND. This standalone 5V GPS Module does not require external 
components  .It  consists  of  internal  RTC  Back  up  battery  and  can  be  directly  connected  to  USART  of  the 
microcontroller. 

The current date, time, longitude, latitude, altitude, speed, and travel direction / heading among other data, are provided 
by  the  module  and  can  be  used  in  a  many  applications  including  navigation,  fleet  management,  tracking  systems, 
mapping and robotics. The module can support up to 51 channels. The GPS solution enables small form factor devices 
which deliver major advancements in GPS performances, accuracy, integration, computing power and flexibility. They 
are used to simplify the embedded system integration process. 
4. Screaming Alarm (APR9600) : The  device offers true on-volatile storage, single-chip voice recording and  playback 
capability for 40 to 60 seconds. It supports both random and sequential access of multiple messages. Sample rates can 
be selected by user, allowing designers to customize their design for unique quality and storage time needs. Microphone 
amplifier, integrated output amplifier and AGC circuits greatly simplify system design. This device is ideal for use in 
portable voice recorders and many other consumer and industrial applications. 

High levels of storage capability is achieved by APLUS integrated using its analog/multilevel storage technology which is   
implemented in an advanced Flash non-volatile memory process. 256 voltage levels can be stored in each memory cell. 
This technology enables the APR9600 device to reproduce voice signals in their natural form eliminating the need for 
encoding and compression, due to which often distortion is introduced. 
5. Pressure Sensor:  Pressure Sensors are used for control and monitoring in thousands of everyday applications .Pressure 
Sensors  can  be  alternatively  called  pressure  transmitters,  pressure  transducers,  pressure  indicators  and  piezometers, 
among other names. Pressure Sensors can vary drastically in technology, design, performance, applications suitability 
and cost. There is also a category of pressure sensors that are designed to measure in a dynamic mode for capturing 
changes  in  pressure.In  a  pressure  switch,  when  pressure  is  applied  to  the  sensor,  the  sensor  either  completes  the 
electrical  circuit  or  breaks  it.  Usually,  a  pressure  sensor  acts  as a transducer.When the pressure is imposed on it, a 
signal is generated. 

 
4.2 Software algorithm 
1. Define the receiver and transmitter pin number of GPS module. 
2. Setup the serial buffer with baud rate 9600 and bit rate 4800. 
3. Now setup a loop which will do the following 

a.  Read the contact number from SIM card memory 
b.  Take data from GPS module. 
c.  Convert the longitude and latitude from GPS into an Goggle URL. 
d.  Attach this URL with the emergency message. 
e.  Send this message to all the numbers from SIM memory periodically until device is reset. 

 
5. Conclusion 
The  proposed  design  will  deal  with  critical  issues  faced  by  women  in  the  near  past  and  will  help  to solve them with 
technologically sound equipments and ideas. This system can overcome the fear that scares every woman in the country 
about her safety and security.

This paper focuses on a security system that is designed solely to serve the purpose of providing security[7] to women so 
that they never feel helpless while facing such social challenges. The system consists of various modules such as GSM 
shield (SIM 900A), Arduino ATMega328 board, GPS (GY-GPS6MV2), screaming alarm (APR 9600), a set of pressure 
sensors for activation and power supply unit. 
The Delhi Nirbhaya case that triggered the whole nation was the greatest motivation for this system. It was high time we 
women needed a change. 
 
2. Existing System 
Keeping the same concern in mind many developers have come up with innovative applications. Few of such applications 
are as follows- 
1. VithU app: This is an emergency app initiated by a popular Indian crime television series “Gumrah” aired on Channel 
[V]. In this app when the power button of the Smartphone is pressed twice consecutively, it will begin sending out alert 
messages with a link to the location of the user every two minutes to the contacts fed into the app. 
2. SHE (Society Harnessing Equipment) : It is a garment designed by three engineers from Chennai. This garment has an 
electric circuit that can generate 3800kv of current which can help the victim to escape.  
In case of multiple attacks it can send upto 82 electric shocks. Since the fabric is bilayer, the user is not affected. It can 
also send emergency messages. 
3. ILA security: The co-founders of this system, McGivern, James Phillips, and Neil Munn , have designed three personal 
alarms that can shock and disorient potential attackers and draw attention to dangerous situations. 
 
3.  Proposed Design 
The  proposed  system  is  to  design  a  portable  device  which  resembles  a  normal  belt.  It  consists  of  Arduino  Board, 
GSM/GPS modules, screaming alarm and pressure sensors. When the threshold of the pressure sensor crosses, the device 
will  get  activated  automatically.  Immediately  the  location  of  the  victim  [3]  will  be  tracked  with  the  help  of  GPS  and 
emergency  messages  will  be  sent  to  three  contacts  and  one  to  police  control  room  every  two  minutes  with  updated 
location.  The  screaming  alarm  unit  will  be  activated  and  will  send  out  sirens to call out for help.  The system is also 
capable to generate an electric shock to harm the attacker which may help the victim [8] to escape.

3. GPS Module: This is a GPS Receiver (5V Serial) with high gain having 4 Pin 2.54mm pitch strip. The third generation 
POT  (Patch  Antenna  on  Top)  is  used  by  the  reciever  for  the  GPS  module.  It  can  be  interfaced  with  normal  5V 
Microcontrollers with the help of the in built 3V-5V converter. The interfacing is made easier with the help of low pin 
count (4 pin) strip. The 4 Pins are 5V, TX, RX, and GND. This standalone 5V GPS Module does not require external 
components  .It  consists  of  internal  RTC  Back  up  battery  and  can  be  directly  connected  to  USART  of  the 
microcontroller. 

The current date, time, longitude, latitude, altitude, speed, and travel direction / heading among other data, are provided 
by  the  module  and  can  be  used  in  a  many  applications  including  navigation,  fleet  management,  tracking  systems, 
mapping and robotics. The module can support up to 51 channels. The GPS solution enables small form factor devices 
which deliver major advancements in GPS performances, accuracy, integration, computing power and flexibility. They 
are used to simplify the embedded system integration process. 
4. Screaming Alarm (APR9600) : The  device offers true on-volatile storage, single-chip voice recording and  playback 
capability for 40 to 60 seconds. It supports both random and sequential access of multiple messages. Sample rates can 
be selected by user, allowing designers to customize their design for unique quality and storage time needs. Microphone 
amplifier, integrated output amplifier and AGC circuits greatly simplify system design. This device is ideal for use in 
portable voice recorders and many other consumer and industrial applications. 

High levels of storage capability is achieved by APLUS integrated using its analog/multilevel storage technology which is   
implemented in an advanced Flash non-volatile memory process. 256 voltage levels can be stored in each memory cell. 
This technology enables the APR9600 device to reproduce voice signals in their natural form eliminating the need for 
encoding and compression, due to which often distortion is introduced. 
5. Pressure Sensor:  Pressure Sensors are used for control and monitoring in thousands of everyday applications .Pressure 
Sensors  can  be  alternatively  called  pressure  transmitters,  pressure  transducers,  pressure  indicators  and  piezometers, 
among other names. Pressure Sensors can vary drastically in technology, design, performance, applications suitability 
and cost. There is also a category of pressure sensors that are designed to measure in a dynamic mode for capturing 
changes  in  pressure.In  a  pressure  switch,  when  pressure  is  applied  to  the  sensor,  the  sensor  either  completes  the 
electrical  circuit  or  breaks  it.  Usually,  a  pressure  sensor  acts  as a transducer.When the pressure is imposed on it, a 
signal is generated. 

 
4.2 Software algorithm 
1. Define the receiver and transmitter pin number of GPS module. 
2. Setup the serial buffer with baud rate 9600 and bit rate 4800. 
3. Now setup a loop which will do the following 

a.  Read the contact number from SIM card memory 
b.  Take data from GPS module. 
c.  Convert the longitude and latitude from GPS into an Goggle URL. 
d.  Attach this URL with the emergency message. 
e.  Send this message to all the numbers from SIM memory periodically until device is reset. 

 
5. Conclusion 
The  proposed  design  will  deal  with  critical  issues  faced  by  women  in  the  near  past  and  will  help  to solve them with 
technologically sound equipments and ideas. This system can overcome the fear that scares every woman in the country 
about her safety and security.
