4.  Define Exercise Objectives 
Defining  the  exercise  objectives  is  the  starting  point 
for the design of the cyber security exercise. All of the 
following  steps  of  the  exercise  design  depend  on  the 
chosen objectives and are influenced by them. 
     The objectives for a cyber security exercise can be 
split in two main categories, according to the type of 
security  training  desired  –  offensive  security  or 
defensive security.  
the 
     The  defensive  security 
participants 
security 
administrator.  Their  main  goal  is  to  be  experts  in 
configuring 
security 
equipments. The best example for this kind of practical 
training  is  the  annual  “Cyber  Defense  Exercise” 
organized  by  the  US  Military  Academy  at  Westpoint 
[4]. 
     On the other side, the offensive security training is 
also an effective way to learn information security, as 
discussed  by  Vigna  [7]  and  Mink  [8].  This  type  of 
training prepares the participants for the generic job of 
penetration  tester  and  helps  them  “think  like  the 
enemy”, in a proactive manner. 
     But these training directions should not be seen as 
completely  separated  from  each  other.  In  order  to 
implement effective defense mechanisms, a very good 
knowledge  of  the  attack  methods  is  needed.  So  a 
security  administrator  needs  to  know  what  are  the 
attacks a penetration tester could implement in order to 
prepare  defense  mechanisms  against  them  and  also  a 
penetration tester must know what defense methods a 
security  administrator  might  implement  in  order  to 
prepare attacks that try to bypass them. 
     In  Table  1  there  are  some  common  learning 
objectives  for  a  cyber  security  exercise  according  to 
the participants’ specialization:

5.  Choose the Approach 
The  approach  chosen  for  the  exercise  shall  be 
directly  derived  from  its  objectives.    Generally,  a 
cyber  defense  exercise  intended  to  train  security 
administrators  would  adopt  a  defense  oriented 
approach  while  an  exercise  for  penetration  testers 
would 
approach. 
Comprehensive  security  training  should  adopt  a 
mixed approach, as described below. 
 
5.1.  Defense Oriented Approach 
When using this approach, the goals of the exercise 
are  to  study  and  practice  the  defense  methods  that 
can  be  used  during  a  cybernetic  attack.  These 
methods  are  more  related  to  system  administration 
and forensics tasks. The defenders should know that 
the defense is a continuous process that can be split 
into the following actions: 

• Create a security policy 
• Implement security measures 
• Monitor the security state

the 
participants.  It  is  held  once  a  year  and  it  is  a 
multi-site, multi-team hacking contest in which a 
number  of  teams  compete  independently  against 
each  other.  The  exercises  are  based  on  the 
DEFCON Capture the Flag contest [6]. 
To address this diversity, this guide can be used as a 
starting  point  for  any  university  that  wishes  to 
organize its own cyber security exercise / competition. 
In this case, the exercise would best fit as a capstone 
project  for  last  year  students,  which  already  have  an 
Information  Assurance  background.  But  the  guide 
does not apply only to university environment; it can 
be used also by other organizations with the purpose of 
training  their  employees  in  Information  Assurance 
field.  
 
3.  Design Steps 
Designing  a  cyber  security  exercise  requires  careful 
planning by multiple persons involved in this activity. 
As we can see from the papers written as feedback for 
various  cyber  security  exercises,  a  cyber  defense 
exercise  can  have  many  forms  but  all  of  them  share 
some common characteristics that we use to build this 
template. We have identified seven steps necessary for 
building a cyber security exercise – Figure 1.

Exercise 

 

 
As we can see, the cyber security exercise contains 
five  main  components  that  must  be  defined  in  the 
following steps of the guide:

4.  Define Exercise Objectives 
Defining  the  exercise  objectives  is  the  starting  point 
for the design of the cyber security exercise. All of the 
following  steps  of  the  exercise  design  depend  on  the 
chosen objectives and are influenced by them. 
     The objectives for a cyber security exercise can be 
split in two main categories, according to the type of 
security  training  desired  –  offensive  security  or 
defensive security.  
the 
     The  defensive  security 
participants 
security 
administrator.  Their  main  goal  is  to  be  experts  in 
configuring 
security 
equipments. The best example for this kind of practical 
training  is  the  annual  “Cyber  Defense  Exercise” 
organized  by  the  US  Military  Academy  at  Westpoint 
[4]. 
     On the other side, the offensive security training is 
also an effective way to learn information security, as 
discussed  by  Vigna  [7]  and  Mink  [8].  This  type  of 
training prepares the participants for the generic job of 
penetration  tester  and  helps  them  “think  like  the 
enemy”, in a proactive manner. 
     But these training directions should not be seen as 
completely  separated  from  each  other.  In  order  to 
implement effective defense mechanisms, a very good 
knowledge  of  the  attack  methods  is  needed.  So  a 
security  administrator  needs  to  know  what  are  the 
attacks a penetration tester could implement in order to 
prepare  defense  mechanisms  against  them  and  also  a 
penetration tester must know what defense methods a 
security  administrator  might  implement  in  order  to 
prepare attacks that try to bypass them. 
     In  Table  1  there  are  some  common  learning 
objectives  for  a  cyber  security  exercise  according  to 
the participants’ specialization:

5.  Choose the Approach 
The  approach  chosen  for  the  exercise  shall  be 
directly  derived  from  its  objectives.    Generally,  a 
cyber  defense  exercise  intended  to  train  security 
administrators  would  adopt  a  defense  oriented 
approach  while  an  exercise  for  penetration  testers 
would 
approach. 
Comprehensive  security  training  should  adopt  a 
mixed approach, as described below. 
 
5.1.  Defense Oriented Approach 
When using this approach, the goals of the exercise 
are  to  study  and  practice  the  defense  methods  that 
can  be  used  during  a  cybernetic  attack.  These 
methods  are  more  related  to  system  administration 
and forensics tasks. The defenders should know that 
the defense is a continuous process that can be split 
into the following actions: 

• Create a security policy 
• Implement security measures 
• Monitor the security state 

RECENT ADVANCES in E-ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION SECURITY and PRIVACYISSN: 1790-5117174ISBN: 978-960-474-143-4• Test your own security state 
• Improve the security 

These actions constitute the well known “Security 
Wheel” – Figure 3 – and should be used in order 
to secure the defended asset, monitor its activity in  
order  to  detect  any  attacks  and  mitigate  them  by 
improving the configurations. 
     In  a  defense  oriented  approach,  there  are  at 
least three ways of organizing the exercise.  
 
• The  participants  receive  the  requirements  and 
services  they  should  provide  and  they  must 
develop their own computer systems to provide 
them 

• The participants receive default installations for 
specific  systems  and  services  to  provide  and 
they  must  configure  them  in  order  to  be 
protected 

• The  participants  receive  already  installed  and 
configured systems and they must protect them  
In  this  approach,  the  attacker  can  be  the 
instructor or an external party. 

 

• gain access or perform DoS 
• escalation of privileges 
• maintain access 
• cover tracks and place backdoors 

In an offence oriented approach, the target can be a 
system  preconfigured  with  known  vulnerabilities 
and  most  not  necessarily  be  administered  by 
someone during the attack. 

Figure 4 – Attacker Actions 

 

 

5.3.  Mixed Approach 
The  mixed  approach  combines 
the  defensive 
approach  with  the  offensive  approach  and  is  the 
most  comprehensive  method  to  perform  a  cyber 
defense exercise. In this case the participants to the 
exercise will be split in two parts, the ones who will 
play the defender role and the ones who will be the 
attackers – Figure 5. 
 

 

Figure 3 – Defender Actions 
5.2.  Offense Oriented Approach 
The  participants  need  to  learn  also  the  offensive 
component  of  a  cyber  defense  exercise  because 
 
this  helps  them  better  understand  how  to  defend 
against  attacks.  There 
is  a  need  for  deep 
understanding of the attack methodologies in order 
to know how to efficiently mitigate them. 
     So  an  offence  oriented  approach  would  place 
the  participants  into  the  attacker’s  position.  They 
will  have  to  perform  attacks  against  various 
targets. In order to simulate a real life attack, the 
participants  should  follow  the  next  steps  of  a 
regular attack (Figure 4): 

• perform reconnaissance 
• scanning and enumeration 

Figure 5 – Mixed Approach 

 

 

6.  Design Network Topology 
At  this  stage,  the  organizers  should  define  the 
infrastructure, what systems will be used during the 
exercise  and  how  they  will  be  interconnected  in 
order to support the exercise objectives.  
For  instance,  if  one  of  the  exercise  objectives  is  to 
train  the  participants  in  defending  a  local  area 
network  with  a  Windows  Active  Directory 
infrastructure, the topology should reflect that.

Abstract: - Cyber security exercises are a very effective way of learning the practical aspects of information 
security. But designing such exercises is not an easy task and requires the work of several people. This paper 
presents  a  number  of  steps  and  guidelines  that  should  be  followed  when  designing  a  new  cyber  security 
exercise.  The  steps  include:  defining  the  objectives,  choosing  an  approach,  designing  network  topology, 
creating a scenario, establishing a set of rules, choosing appropriate metrics and learning lessons. The intended 
audience  of  this  paper  is  persons  who  are  in  charge  with  design  and  organization  of  a  new  cyber  security 
exercise and do not have the experience of previous exercises. 
 
Key-Words: - cyber security exercise, cyber defense exercise, security education, design guide 
 
1.  Introduction  
 
Cyber security exercises have been for a long time the 
ultimate  learning  experience  for  many  students  in 
some  universities,  especially  from  United  States  [1]. 
Periodical  competitions  are  organized  between 
universities  or  inside  one  university  where  students 
play the roles of attackers or defenders in a controlled 
and well defined environment.  
these  exercises 
is 
     The  whole  purpose  of 
educational, 
students  have  an 
that 
experiential  training  in  information  security  –  a 
process  described  in  Kolb’s  Experiential  Learning 
Theory [2]. 
     This paper is meant to be a guide that can be used 
by  universities  or  other  organizations  to  prepare  a 
cyber  security  exercise.  The  steps  needed  to  do  that 
were  synthesized  from  a  series  of  academic  papers 
written  after  various  cyber  security  exercises.  The 
guide describes seven steps that should be taken when 
organizing such an exercise. Each step is presented in 
detail  and  some  options  for  implementation  are  also 
given. 

The  contribution  this  paper  brings  is  a  general 
method to organize a cyber security exercise that can 
be  customized 
the  organizer’s  needs  and 
objectives. The previous work in this area consists in 
some  efforts  to  document  a  framework  for  cyber 
security  education  [3]  and  a  series  of  analysis, 
overview 
about 
generalization of cyber security exercises [1].  
 
 
2.  The Need for a Uniform Structure 
There is a great diversity  among the cyber security 
exercises  organized  until  now  regarding 
their 
structure, objectives and approach.  
     For instance, the Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX) 
is an inter-academy competition [4] in which teams 
design, implement, manage and defend a network of 
computers. The attacker role is played by a team of 
security  professionals  from  various  government 
agencies.  In  this  exercise  students  are  focusing  on 
defensive tasks in network security, and spend a lot  

to  ensure

questions

First  of  all,  the  exercise  must  have  a  set  of 
objectives.  Based  on  these  objectives,  we  take  a 
specific  approach  in  designing  the  exercise.  Also 
based  on  the  objectives,  we  decide  which  specific 
hardware  and  software  equipment  shall  be  used  in 
the exercise and what will be their overall topology. 
Based  on  the  topology  and  the  objectives  we  build 
the  scenario of the exercise  –  the  story. The set of 
rules  derive  from 
the 
objectives. The metrics necessary for measuring the 
efficiency of the exercise shall be based also on the 
established  objectives.  Finally,  the  exercise  should 
have  a  method  of  gathering  the  lessons  learned  by 
the  participants  and  also  by  the  organizers.  All  of 
these  template  steps  will  be  described  in  the 
following paragraphs of this paper. 
     Another  important  aspect  of  the  exercise  is  to 
define the entities that will compose it. In a general 
cyber  security  exercise  there  are  mainly  two  sides: 
the attacker side and the defender side. On each side 
there  are  computer  systems  that  are  managed  by 
teams  of  participants.  Each  side  must  have  at  least 
one  system  to  participate  to  the  exercise  and  the 
is 
maximum  number  of  participating  systems 
theoretically 
infinite.  The  components  of 
the 
exercise are represented in Figure 2.

each  other.  The  exercises  are  based  on  the 
DEFCON Capture the Flag contest [6]. 
To address this diversity, this guide can be used as a 
starting  point  for  any  university  that  wishes  to 
organize its own cyber security exercise / competition. 
In this case, the exercise would best fit as a capstone 
project  for  last  year  students,  which  already  have  an 
Information  Assurance  background.  But  the  guide 
does not apply only to university environment; it can 
be used also by other organizations with the purpose of 
training  their  employees  in  Information  Assurance 
field.  
 
3.  Design Steps 
Designing  a  cyber  security  exercise  requires  careful 
planning by multiple persons involved in this activity. 
As we can see from the papers written as feedback for 
various  cyber  security  exercises,  a  cyber  defense 
exercise  can  have  many  forms  but  all  of  them  share 
some common characteristics that we use to build this 
template. We have identified seven steps necessary for 
building a cyber security exercise – Figure 1.

Defining  the  exercise  objectives  is  the  starting  point 
for the design of the cyber security exercise. All of the 
following  steps  of  the  exercise  design  depend  on  the 
chosen objectives and are influenced by them.

also an effective way to learn information security, as

     But these training directions should not be seen as

implement effective defense mechanisms, a very good 
knowledge  of  the  attack  methods  is  needed.  So  a

These actions constitute the well known “Security

to secure the defended asset, monitor its activity in

and  most  not  necessarily  be  administered  by 
someone during the attack.

5.3.  Mixed Approach 
The  mixed  approach  combines 
the  defensive 
approach  with  the  offensive  approach  and  is  the 
most  comprehensive  method  to  perform  a  cyber 
defense exercise. In this case the participants to the 
exercise will be split in two parts, the ones who will 
play the defender role and the ones who will be the 
attackers – Figure 5. 
 

 

Figure 3 – Defender Actions 
5.2.  Offense Oriented Approach 
The  participants  need  to  learn  also  the  offensive 
component  of  a  cyber  defense  exercise  because 
 
this  helps  them  better  understand  how  to  defend 
against  attacks.  There 
is  a  need  for  deep 
understanding of the attack methodologies in order 
to know how to efficiently mitigate them. 
     So  an  offence  oriented  approach  would  place 
the  participants  into  the  attacker’s  position.  They 
will  have  to  perform  attacks  against  various 
targets. In order to simulate a real life attack, the 
participants  should  follow  the  next  steps  of  a 
regular attack (Figure 4): 

• perform reconnaissance 
• scanning and enumeration 

Figure 5 – Mixed Approach 

 

 

6.  Design Network Topology 
At  this  stage,  the  organizers  should  define  the 
infrastructure, what systems will be used during the 
exercise  and  how  they  will  be  interconnected  in 
order to support the exercise objectives.  
For  instance,  if  one  of  the  exercise  objectives  is  to 
train  the  participants  in  defending  a  local  area 
network  with  a  Windows  Active  Directory 
infrastructure, the topology should reflect that.  

RECENT ADVANCES in E-ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION SECURITY and PRIVACYISSN: 1790-5117175ISBN: 978-960-474-143-4The topology should also be according to the number 
of participants to the exercise, to ensure no bottlenecks 
and best communication between systems. 

7.  Create Exercise Scenario 
Until  now,  we  have  established  what  we  want  to  do 
from the technical point of view. Now it’s the time to 
give the exercise a shape that can be presented to the 
participants. This is the scenario and it should put the 
participants in a realistic situation in which they must 
defend  or  attack  a  target  system.  The  scenario 
describes  the  situation  that  the  exercise  is  trying  to 
simulate  and  the  logical  flow  of  events  that  will  be 
happening. It should also contain an intriguing story in 
order  to  increase  the  participants’  degree  of  interest. 
As part of the scenario, the participants could be asked 
to perform business related tasks during the exercise, 
in order to simulate a real working environment. 
     The  realism  of  the  scenario  is  also  given  by  the 
attacker’s goals. In general, the cybernetic attack goals 
fall into the following categories: 

• access confidential data (read/write) 
• disrupt services 
• control machines 

 
 

 

These are the things that the defenders must not allow 
to happen. 
     From  the  logical  point  of  view,  the  targets  of  the 
attacks can be: 

• public services 
• computer networks 
• humans 
• trust relationships 

 
 
8.  Establish a Set of Rules 
 
The rules and guidelines for a cyber defense exercise 
should address the following topics: 
•  General rules 
These rules should express clearly how the exercise is 
supposed  to  run  and  how  the  participant  should  be 
organized.  They  should  also  address  problems  like: 
equity between team resources, what tools are allowed 
to  use,  team  responsibilities,  each  team’s  role  in  the 
competition,  communication  between  participants, 
competition timing, etc. 
Another  thing  that  these  rules  should  specify  is  what 
happens  if  one  participant  breaks  one  rule  (e.g. 
 
disqualification, penalty). 
 
•  Scoring engine 

transparent 

This  set  of  rules  must  express  the  way  the  teams 
obtain points, what are the winning conditions, what 
are  the  actions  for  which  teams  lose  points  and 
which  actions  will  not  get  them  any  points.  The 
scoring  method  should  be 
to  all 
participants to the exercise.  
•  Eligibility 
There  should  be  well  defined  criteria  for  the 
participation  at  the  exercise.  For  instance,  if  the 
exercise  was  organized  by  a  university, 
the 
participants would be eligible if they were students 
at that university and if they had passed successfully 
all  their  information  security  related  exams.  Other 
criteria could be: age, study year, clean background, 
etc. 
•  Legal issues 
From  the  legal  point  of  view,  the set  of  rules  must 
express the limitations imposed by the state law and 
local law from where the exercise will be organized. 
Exercise organizers should check law related aspects 
for:  unauthorized  intrusion,  unauthorized  access  to 
data  in  transmission,  unauthorized  access  to  stored 
data, 
contractual 
obligations. 
     For  instance,  the  usage  of  some  attack  tools 
might be interdicted – like in Germany [9].  
•  Limitations 
The  rules  should  also  establish  what  are  strategies 
and  practices  that  are  and  the  ones  that  are  not 
allowed during the exercise. They should be divided  
in  rules  for  defenders  and  rules  for  attackers  (e.g. 
DoS  attacks  are  not  allowed).  The  persons  who 
arbitrate the competition should also know what are 
their limitations (e.g. they must not influence any of 
the teams). 

rights, 

individual 

privacy 

9.  Choose Appropriate Metrics 
To measure the effectiveness of the cyber security 
exercise,  a  set  of  metrics 
is  needed.  The 
effectiveness  of  the  exercise  expresses  how  well 
the objectives have been achieved. So the chosen 
metrics should be tightly related to the objectives. 
On  the  other  side,  the  objectives  should  be 
expressed in measurable terms.

Abstract: - Cyber security exercises are a very effective way of learning the practical aspects of information 
security. But designing such exercises is not an easy task and requires the work of several people. This paper 
presents  a  number  of  steps  and  guidelines  that  should  be  followed  when  designing  a  new  cyber  security 
exercise.  The  steps  include:  defining  the  objectives,  choosing  an  approach,  designing  network  topology, 
creating a scenario, establishing a set of rules, choosing appropriate metrics and learning lessons. The intended 
audience  of  this  paper  is  persons  who  are  in  charge  with  design  and  organization  of  a  new  cyber  security 
exercise and do not have the experience of previous exercises. 
 
Key-Words: - cyber security exercise, cyber defense exercise, security education, design guide 
 
1.  Introduction  
 
Cyber security exercises have been for a long time the 
ultimate  learning  experience  for  many  students  in 
some  universities,  especially  from  United  States  [1]. 
Periodical  competitions  are  organized  between 
universities  or  inside  one  university  where  students 
play the roles of attackers or defenders in a controlled 
and well defined environment.  
these  exercises 
is 
     The  whole  purpose  of 
educational, 
students  have  an 
that 
experiential  training  in  information  security  –  a 
process  described  in  Kolb’s  Experiential  Learning 
Theory [2]. 
     This paper is meant to be a guide that can be used 
by  universities  or  other  organizations  to  prepare  a 
cyber  security  exercise.  The  steps  needed  to  do  that 
were  synthesized  from  a  series  of  academic  papers 
written  after  various  cyber  security  exercises.  The 
guide describes seven steps that should be taken when 
organizing such an exercise. Each step is presented in 
detail  and  some  options  for  implementation  are  also 
given. 

The  contribution  this  paper  brings  is  a  general 
method to organize a cyber security exercise that can 
be  customized 
the  organizer’s  needs  and 
objectives. The previous work in this area consists in 
some  efforts  to  document  a  framework  for  cyber 
security  education  [3]  and  a  series  of  analysis, 
overview 
about 
generalization of cyber security exercises [1].  
 
 
2.  The Need for a Uniform Structure 
There is a great diversity  among the cyber security 
exercises  organized  until  now  regarding 
their 
structure, objectives and approach.  
     For instance, the Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX) 
is an inter-academy competition [4] in which teams 
design, implement, manage and defend a network of 
computers. The attacker role is played by a team of 
security  professionals  from  various  government 
agencies.  In  this  exercise  students  are  focusing  on 
defensive tasks in network security, and spend a lot  

to  ensure

First  of  all,  the  exercise  must  have  a  set  of 
objectives.  Based  on  these  objectives,  we  take  a 
specific  approach  in  designing  the  exercise.  Also 
based  on  the  objectives,  we  decide  which  specific 
hardware  and  software  equipment  shall  be  used  in 
the exercise and what will be their overall topology. 
Based  on  the  topology  and  the  objectives  we  build 
the  scenario of the exercise  –  the  story. The set of 
rules  derive  from 
the 
objectives. The metrics necessary for measuring the 
efficiency of the exercise shall be based also on the 
established  objectives.  Finally,  the  exercise  should 
have  a  method  of  gathering  the  lessons  learned  by 
the  participants  and  also  by  the  organizers.  All  of 
these  template  steps  will  be  described  in  the 
following paragraphs of this paper. 
     Another  important  aspect  of  the  exercise  is  to 
define the entities that will compose it. In a general 
cyber  security  exercise  there  are  mainly  two  sides: 
the attacker side and the defender side. On each side 
there  are  computer  systems  that  are  managed  by 
teams  of  participants.  Each  side  must  have  at  least 
one  system  to  participate  to  the  exercise  and  the 
is 
maximum  number  of  participating  systems 
theoretically 
infinite.  The  components  of 
the 
exercise are represented in Figure 2.

organizers  of  the  International  Capture  The  Flag 
(also  known  as  the  iCTF)  form  University  of 
California,  Santa  Barbara.  The  iCTF  contest  is  a 
distributed,  wide-area  security  exercise,  whose 
goal 
the 
participants.  It  is  held  once  a  year  and  it  is  a 
multi-site, multi-team hacking contest in which a 
number  of  teams  compete  independently  against 
each  other.  The  exercises  are  based  on  the 
DEFCON Capture the Flag contest [6]. 
To address this diversity, this guide can be used as a 
starting  point  for  any  university  that  wishes  to 
organize its own cyber security exercise / competition. 
In this case, the exercise would best fit as a capstone 
project  for  last  year  students,  which  already  have  an 
Information  Assurance  background.  But  the  guide 
does not apply only to university environment; it can 
be used also by other organizations with the purpose of 
training  their  employees  in  Information  Assurance 
field.  
 
3.  Design Steps 
Designing  a  cyber  security  exercise  requires  careful 
planning by multiple persons involved in this activity. 
As we can see from the papers written as feedback for 
various  cyber  security  exercises,  a  cyber  defense 
exercise  can  have  many  forms  but  all  of  them  share 
some common characteristics that we use to build this 
template. We have identified seven steps necessary for 
building a cyber security exercise – Figure 1. 
 

Figure 2 – The Components of a Cyber Defense 

Exercise 

 

 
As we can see, the cyber security exercise contains 
five  main  components  that  must  be  defined  in  the 
following steps of the guide:

4.  Define Exercise Objectives 
Defining  the  exercise  objectives  is  the  starting  point 
for the design of the cyber security exercise. All of the 
following  steps  of  the  exercise  design  depend  on  the 
chosen objectives and are influenced by them. 
     The objectives for a cyber security exercise can be 
split in two main categories, according to the type of 
security  training  desired  –  offensive  security  or 
defensive security.  
the 
     The  defensive  security 
participants 
security 
administrator.  Their  main  goal  is  to  be  experts  in 
configuring 
security 
equipments. The best example for this kind of practical 
training  is  the  annual  “Cyber  Defense  Exercise” 
organized  by  the  US  Military  Academy  at  Westpoint 
[4]. 
     On the other side, the offensive security training is 
also an effective way to learn information security, as 
discussed  by  Vigna  [7]  and  Mink  [8].  This  type  of 
training prepares the participants for the generic job of 
penetration  tester  and  helps  them  “think  like  the 
enemy”, in a proactive manner. 
     But these training directions should not be seen as 
completely  separated  from  each  other.  In  order  to 
implement effective defense mechanisms, a very good 
knowledge  of  the  attack  methods  is  needed.  So  a 
security  administrator  needs  to  know  what  are  the 
attacks a penetration tester could implement in order to 
prepare  defense  mechanisms  against  them  and  also  a 
penetration tester must know what defense methods a 
security  administrator  might  implement  in  order  to 
prepare attacks that try to bypass them. 
     In  Table  1  there  are  some  common  learning 
objectives  for  a  cyber  security  exercise  according  to 
the participants’ specialization:

5.  Choose the Approach 
The  approach  chosen  for  the  exercise  shall  be 
directly  derived  from  its  objectives.    Generally,  a 
cyber  defense  exercise  intended  to  train  security 
administrators  would  adopt  a  defense  oriented 
approach  while  an  exercise  for  penetration  testers 
would 
approach. 
Comprehensive  security  training  should  adopt  a 
mixed approach, as described below. 
 
5.1.  Defense Oriented Approach 
When using this approach, the goals of the exercise 
are  to  study  and  practice  the  defense  methods  that 
can  be  used  during  a  cybernetic  attack.  These 
methods  are  more  related  to  system  administration 
and forensics tasks. The defenders should know that 
the defense is a continuous process that can be split 
into the following actions: 

• Create a security policy 
• Implement security measures 
• Monitor the security state 

RECENT ADVANCES in E-ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION SECURITY and PRIVACYISSN: 1790-5117174ISBN: 978-960-474-143-4• Test your own security state 
• Improve the security 

These actions constitute the well known “Security 
Wheel” – Figure 3 – and should be used in order 
to secure the defended asset, monitor its activity in  
order  to  detect  any  attacks  and  mitigate  them  by 
improving the configurations. 
     In  a  defense  oriented  approach,  there  are  at 
least three ways of organizing the exercise.  
 
• The  participants  receive  the  requirements  and 
services  they  should  provide  and  they  must 
develop their own computer systems to provide 
them 

• The participants receive default installations for 
specific  systems  and  services  to  provide  and 
they  must  configure  them  in  order  to  be 
protected 

• The  participants  receive  already  installed  and 
configured systems and they must protect them  
In  this  approach,  the  attacker  can  be  the 
instructor or an external party. 

 

• gain access or perform DoS 
• escalation of privileges 
• maintain access 
• cover tracks and place backdoors 

In an offence oriented approach, the target can be a 
system  preconfigured  with  known  vulnerabilities 
and  most  not  necessarily  be  administered  by 
someone during the attack. 

Figure 4 – Attacker Actions 

 

 

5.3.  Mixed Approach 
The  mixed  approach  combines 
the  defensive 
approach  with  the  offensive  approach  and  is  the 
most  comprehensive  method  to  perform  a  cyber 
defense exercise. In this case the participants to the 
exercise will be split in two parts, the ones who will 
play the defender role and the ones who will be the 
attackers – Figure 5. 
 

 

Figure 3 – Defender Actions 
5.2.  Offense Oriented Approach 
The  participants  need  to  learn  also  the  offensive 
component  of  a  cyber  defense  exercise  because 
 
this  helps  them  better  understand  how  to  defend 
against  attacks.  There 
is  a  need  for  deep 
understanding of the attack methodologies in order 
to know how to efficiently mitigate them. 
     So  an  offence  oriented  approach  would  place 
the  participants  into  the  attacker’s  position.  They 
will  have  to  perform  attacks  against  various 
targets. In order to simulate a real life attack, the 
participants  should  follow  the  next  steps  of  a 
regular attack (Figure 4): 

• perform reconnaissance 
• scanning and enumeration 

Figure 5 – Mixed Approach 

 

 

6.  Design Network Topology 
At  this  stage,  the  organizers  should  define  the 
infrastructure, what systems will be used during the 
exercise  and  how  they  will  be  interconnected  in 
order to support the exercise objectives.  
For  instance,  if  one  of  the  exercise  objectives  is  to 
train  the  participants  in  defending  a  local  area 
network  with  a  Windows  Active  Directory 
infrastructure, the topology should reflect that.  

RECENT ADVANCES in E-ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION SECURITY and PRIVACYISSN: 1790-5117175ISBN: 978-960-474-143-4The topology should also be according to the number 
of participants to the exercise, to ensure no bottlenecks 
and best communication between systems. 

7.  Create Exercise Scenario 
Until  now,  we  have  established  what  we  want  to  do 
from the technical point of view. Now it’s the time to 
give the exercise a shape that can be presented to the 
participants. This is the scenario and it should put the 
participants in a realistic situation in which they must 
defend  or  attack  a  target  system.  The  scenario 
describes  the  situation  that  the  exercise  is  trying  to 
simulate  and  the  logical  flow  of  events  that  will  be 
happening. It should also contain an intriguing story in 
order  to  increase  the  participants’  degree  of  interest. 
As part of the scenario, the participants could be asked 
to perform business related tasks during the exercise, 
in order to simulate a real working environment. 
     The  realism  of  the  scenario  is  also  given  by  the 
attacker’s goals. In general, the cybernetic attack goals 
fall into the following categories: 

• access confidential data (read/write) 
• disrupt services 
• control machines 

 
 

 

These are the things that the defenders must not allow 
to happen. 
     From  the  logical  point  of  view,  the  targets  of  the 
attacks can be: 

• public services 
• computer networks 
• humans 
• trust relationships 

 
 
8.  Establish a Set of Rules 
 
The rules and guidelines for a cyber defense exercise 
should address the following topics: 
•  General rules 
These rules should express clearly how the exercise is 
supposed  to  run  and  how  the  participant  should  be 
organized.  They  should  also  address  problems  like: 
equity between team resources, what tools are allowed 
to  use,  team  responsibilities,  each  team’s  role  in  the 
competition,  communication  between  participants, 
competition timing, etc. 
Another  thing  that  these  rules  should  specify  is  what 
happens  if  one  participant  breaks  one  rule  (e.g. 
 
disqualification, penalty). 
 
•  Scoring engine 

transparent 

This  set  of  rules  must  express  the  way  the  teams 
obtain points, what are the winning conditions, what 
are  the  actions  for  which  teams  lose  points  and 
which  actions  will  not  get  them  any  points.  The 
scoring  method  should  be 
to  all 
participants to the exercise.  
•  Eligibility 
There  should  be  well  defined  criteria  for  the 
participation  at  the  exercise.  For  instance,  if  the 
exercise  was  organized  by  a  university, 
the 
participants would be eligible if they were students 
at that university and if they had passed successfully 
all  their  information  security  related  exams.  Other 
criteria could be: age, study year, clean background, 
etc. 
•  Legal issues 
From  the  legal  point  of  view,  the set  of  rules  must 
express the limitations imposed by the state law and 
local law from where the exercise will be organized. 
Exercise organizers should check law related aspects 
for:  unauthorized  intrusion,  unauthorized  access  to 
data  in  transmission,  unauthorized  access  to  stored 
data, 
contractual 
obligations. 
     For  instance,  the  usage  of  some  attack  tools 
might be interdicted – like in Germany [9].  
•  Limitations 
The  rules  should  also  establish  what  are  strategies 
and  practices  that  are  and  the  ones  that  are  not 
allowed during the exercise. They should be divided  
in  rules  for  defenders  and  rules  for  attackers  (e.g. 
DoS  attacks  are  not  allowed).  The  persons  who 
arbitrate the competition should also know what are 
their limitations (e.g. they must not influence any of 
the teams).

9.  Choose Appropriate Metrics 
To measure the effectiveness of the cyber security 
exercise,  a  set  of  metrics 
is  needed.  The 
effectiveness  of  the  exercise  expresses  how  well 
the objectives have been achieved. So the chosen 
metrics should be tightly related to the objectives. 
On  the  other  side,  the  objectives  should  be 
expressed in measurable terms. 
In Table 2 there are some examples of objectives 
for  a  cyber  security  exercise  and  the  associated 
metrics:

systems kept until the 
end of the exercise

10.  Don’t Forget the Lessons Learned 
This step is very important for the effectiveness of the 
cyber security exercise. The organizers should find an 
appropriate  mechanism  for  gathering  feedback  from 
the participants (e.g. evaluation forms at the end of the 
exercise).  A  very  useful  information  would  be  the 
techniques and tools that each party had used in order 
to 
scenario  objectives.  After 
centralization and analysis, this information should be 
made  public  because  it  will  help  the  participants 
realize  what  was  really  going  on  during  the  exercise 
and will help the organizers improve other editions of 
the exercise.

     This  paper  presented  a  number  of  steps  and 
guidelines that should be followed when designing a 
new  cyber  security  exercise.  The  guidelines  have 
been  crystallized  from  the  analysis  of  a  number  of 
papers written after various cyber security exercises. 
     The ideas presented in this paper can be used by 
anyone  who  wants  to  organize  a  cyber  security 
exercise

universities,  companies,  governmental  institutions, 
etc).
