I.  INTRODUCTION 

 Fuel is the one of the most essential thing in today‟s 
world. We can see number of petrol pumps around us. Our 
aim  is  to  develop  the  security  system  for  the  petrol 
distribution tankers of Petroleum Company. The aim of the 
system  is  to  open  or  close  the  tank-valve  of  the  tanker 
controlling  from  control  cabin.  We  will  use  GSM 
technology for this purpose.  

The system will consist of two units; one unit will be 
placed at tanker which will monitor continuously the fuel 
level in the tank. The initial original fuel level and current 
fuel  level  will  be  displayed  on  LCD  at  front  for  driver‟s 
convenience. Second is the RFID assembly which will read 
the authentication code of the petrol pump. The amount of 
fuel poured at particular petrol pump and petrol pump ID 
will be send to central office through GSM techniques. The 
visual  basic  coding  will  help  to  control  (to  check 
authorized petrol pump, to send valve opening signal) and 
to  keep  record  of  all  these  things  (total  fuel  delivered, 
current fuel level, coasting of delivered petrol.).  

 

In short we provide total security while distributing the 

fuel! 

A.  Aim of the project 

As we are stepping towards the 21st century, man is 
becoming  very  careful  about  security,  with  no  exception 
for industries. Various petroleum industries are becoming 
very careful about manufacturing and distribution of their 
products. 

New  technology  addresses  these  requirements, 
providing the foundation to allow cooperative interaction 
to be developed. Thus the Embedded security system using 
GSM  and  RFID  techniques  is  just  example  of  new 
technology which will be providing the base for security of 
product  distribution  and  data  keeping  using  electronic 
control.[2] 

As  project  is  PC  controlled,  the  project  will  be 
connected  to  one  of  the  PC  port  and  some  programming 
language (Visual Basic) in order to control the project. 

The  project  is  also  wireless  control  so  PC  is 
connected  to  the  Control  Cabin  and  other  module  is 
connected to main ckt. in tanker unit.[5] 

B.  Purpose  

The purpose of this planning is to establish the scope 
of the project in terms of the major functions, performance 
issues and technical constraints. The plan will provide an 
estimate of the size of the product, the effort required and 
the duration. 

This  plan  will  also  consider  the  risk  encountered 
during the project and the strategies for dealing with them. 
The plan will also discuss the detailed schedule of various 
subtasks within the project and also the resources needed 
to accomplish them. 

C.  Brief History 

In  starting  day‟s  the  petroleum  industries  were 
distributing  petrol  using  tankers  to  respective  petrol 
pumps; which were normally manual distribution and was 
totally depends on man‟s loyality who was doing this job. 
Now  a  day‟s  industries  are  becoming  very  careful  about 
these  things  and  trying  to  centrally  control  all  the 
production and distribution of products. 

For  the  secure  distribution  of  products,  industries 
trying  to  develop  the  new  advance  security  system  to 
achieve  their  goal.    However  today  petrol  distribution 
system is has some disadvantages regarding with stilling of 
petrol, unauthorized petrol selling by distributor, mixing of 
impure and improper items in petrol etc.

the  fuel  from 

The  customer  demanding 

the 
petroleum industry will first call the industry to convey the 
requirement. Company will send the fuel via tanker to the 
petrol pump. Now, our system comes into existence in two 
parts, one is placed inside the tanker/vehicle and other is 
placed at the distributing industry itself. One unit which is 
placed at tanker will monitor continuously the fuel level in 
the  tank.  The  initial  original  fuel  level  and  current  fuel 
level  will  be  displayed  on  LCD  at  front  for  driver‟s 
convenience. The electronic valve is provided to keep the 
tanker opening block until it get the opening order from the 
microcontroller  unit  .The  RFID  assembly  reads  the 
authentication  code  of  the  petrol  pump  by  swapping  the 
reader  over  the  RFID  tag  pasted  at  the  petrol  pump  and 
send it to the control unit to update the database as well as 
to authenticate the customer who is demanding the petrol. 
On  the  tanker  unit  side,  the  RFID  system  is 
connected to the microcontroller, level sensor and relay / 
electronic  valve  assembly;  where  the  RFID  reader  will 
identify the authenticated user ID and send the information 
about level of fuel and user ID number to the Control cabin 
section.[7] The borrower just needs to convey the required 
amount of fuel to be poured to the industrial operator by 
any communication media.  

On  the  other  hand  the  control  cabin  consists  of 
another  GSM  unit  which  receives  the  information  from 
tanker unit and interface serially to personal computer so as 
to edit that data for further work of response. The further 
action  is  taken  by  the  software  like  Visual  basic  with 
support of Microsoft access and predefined algorithm. The 
algorithm  is  made  so  as  to  identify  the  match  between 
present identity and received code. If the received data gets 
perfect match with the present data then the control units 
will response the tanker unit via GSM message in the form 
*01(amount of fuel).  

The  interrupt  to  the  microcontroller  to  activate/ 
deactivate the control valve relay is provided by the SMS 
by the control cabin‟s GSM unit using “* 01X” topologies, 
where the „X‟ is amount of fuel. The microcontroller first 
separate the “*01” and “X”, and using the value „X‟ it will 
open  the  valve.  Here  „*01‟  creates  interrupt  inside  the 
microcontroller.[3]  On  receiving  the  interrupt  from  the 
control cabin unit, the valve takes action accordingly. The 
microcontroller  continuously  sense  the  fuel  level  using 
level sensor and keeps the valve open until it reaches the 
quantity to be delivered by decrementing the counter. Here 
the  initial  fuel  level  as  well  as  the  level  of  fuel  after 
delivery gets display on the LCD screen. Also, the control 
unit updates the database by recording the time and date of 
delivery  and  whether  payment  is  done  or  not!  Thus  our 
system  provides  total  and  central  control  on  petrol 
distribution using simple RFID and GSM techniques.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

 Fuel is the one of the most essential thing in today‟s 
world. We can see number of petrol pumps around us. Our 
aim  is  to  develop  the  security  system  for  the  petrol 
distribution tankers of Petroleum Company. The aim of the 
system  is  to  open  or  close  the  tank-valve  of  the  tanker 
controlling  from  control  cabin.  We  will  use  GSM 
technology for this purpose.  

The system will consist of two units; one unit will be 
placed at tanker which will monitor continuously the fuel 
level in the tank. The initial original fuel level and current 
fuel  level  will  be  displayed  on  LCD  at  front  for  driver‟s 
convenience. Second is the RFID assembly which will read 
the authentication code of the petrol pump. The amount of 
fuel poured at particular petrol pump and petrol pump ID 
will be send to central office through GSM techniques. The 
visual  basic  coding  will  help  to  control  (to  check 
authorized petrol pump, to send valve opening signal) and 
to  keep  record  of  all  these  things  (total  fuel  delivered, 
current fuel level, coasting of delivered petrol.).  

 

In short we provide total security while distributing the 

fuel! 

A.  Aim of the project 

As we are stepping towards the 21st century, man is 
becoming  very  careful  about  security,  with  no  exception 
for industries. Various petroleum industries are becoming 
very careful about manufacturing and distribution of their 
products. 

New  technology  addresses  these  requirements, 
providing the foundation to allow cooperative interaction 
to be developed. Thus the Embedded security system using 
GSM  and  RFID  techniques  is  just  example  of  new 
technology which will be providing the base for security of 
product  distribution  and  data  keeping  using  electronic 
control.[2] 

As  project  is  PC  controlled,  the  project  will  be 
connected  to  one  of  the  PC  port  and  some  programming 
language (Visual Basic) in order to control the project. 

The  project  is  also  wireless  control  so  PC  is 
connected  to  the  Control  Cabin  and  other  module  is 
connected to main ckt. in tanker unit.[5] 

B.  Purpose  

The purpose of this planning is to establish the scope 
of the project in terms of the major functions, performance 
issues and technical constraints. The plan will provide an 
estimate of the size of the product, the effort required and 
the duration. 

This  plan  will  also  consider  the  risk  encountered 
during the project and the strategies for dealing with them. 
The plan will also discuss the detailed schedule of various 
subtasks within the project and also the resources needed 
to accomplish them. 

C.  Brief History 

In  starting  day‟s  the  petroleum  industries  were 
distributing  petrol  using  tankers  to  respective  petrol 
pumps; which were normally manual distribution and was 
totally depends on man‟s loyality who was doing this job. 
Now  a  day‟s  industries  are  becoming  very  careful  about 
these  things  and  trying  to  centrally  control  all  the 
production and distribution of products. 

For  the  secure  distribution  of  products,  industries 
trying  to  develop  the  new  advance  security  system  to 
achieve  their  goal.    However  today  petrol  distribution 
system is has some disadvantages regarding with stilling of 
petrol, unauthorized petrol selling by distributor, mixing of 
impure and improper items in petrol etc.

the  fuel  from 

The  customer  demanding 

the 
petroleum industry will first call the industry to convey the 
requirement. Company will send the fuel via tanker to the 
petrol pump. Now, our system comes into existence in two 
parts, one is placed inside the tanker/vehicle and other is 
placed at the distributing industry itself. One unit which is 
placed at tanker will monitor continuously the fuel level in 
the  tank.  The  initial  original  fuel  level  and  current  fuel 
level  will  be  displayed  on  LCD  at  front  for  driver‟s 
convenience. The electronic valve is provided to keep the 
tanker opening block until it get the opening order from the 
microcontroller  unit  .The  RFID  assembly  reads  the 
authentication  code  of  the  petrol  pump  by  swapping  the 
reader  over  the  RFID  tag  pasted  at  the  petrol  pump  and 
send it to the control unit to update the database as well as 
to authenticate the customer who is demanding the petrol. 
On  the  tanker  unit  side,  the  RFID  system  is 
connected to the microcontroller, level sensor and relay / 
electronic  valve  assembly;  where  the  RFID  reader  will 
identify the authenticated user ID and send the information 
about level of fuel and user ID number to the Control cabin 
section.[7] The borrower just needs to convey the required 
amount of fuel to be poured to the industrial operator by 
any communication media.  

On  the  other  hand  the  control  cabin  consists  of 
another  GSM  unit  which  receives  the  information  from 
tanker unit and interface serially to personal computer so as 
to edit that data for further work of response. The further 
action  is  taken  by  the  software  like  Visual  basic  with 
support of Microsoft access and predefined algorithm. The 
algorithm  is  made  so  as  to  identify  the  match  between 
present identity and received code. If the received data gets 
perfect match with the present data then the control units 
will response the tanker unit via GSM message in the form 
*01(amount of fuel).  

The  interrupt  to  the  microcontroller  to  activate/ 
deactivate the control valve relay is provided by the SMS 
by the control cabin‟s GSM unit using “* 01X” topologies, 
where the „X‟ is amount of fuel. The microcontroller first 
separate the “*01” and “X”, and using the value „X‟ it will 
open  the  valve.  Here  „*01‟  creates  interrupt  inside  the 
microcontroller.[3]  On  receiving  the  interrupt  from  the 
control cabin unit, the valve takes action accordingly. The 
microcontroller  continuously  sense  the  fuel  level  using 
level sensor and keeps the valve open until it reaches the 
quantity to be delivered by decrementing the counter. Here 
the  initial  fuel  level  as  well  as  the  level  of  fuel  after 
delivery gets display on the LCD screen. Also, the control 
unit updates the database by recording the time and date of 
delivery  and  whether  payment  is  done  or  not!  Thus  our 
system  provides  total  and  central  control  on  petrol 
distribution using simple RFID and GSM techniques.

VI.  ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS  

A.  Advantages 

1.  This  system  has  simple  components  and  simple            

2. 

construction of them on circuit. 
It  is  possible  to  implement  this  system  on  small 
board space also. 

3.  GSM system used in our project provides  quick 

data communication over long distance also. 

4.  RFID  system  helps  us  to  provide  the  maximum 
security to authenticate the user at minimum cost. 
 It requires very less power supply i.e. from 5V to 
12 V only, which is easily available. 

5. 

6.  Also  as  it  provides  the  central  control  on  petrol 
distribution, thus there is no question of stilling or 
to change the record of distributed fuel.  

7.  Easy to handle for distributor since only amount 
of  fuel  which  is  to  be  poured  need  to  type  on 
keypad  and 
takes  place 
automatically. 

remaining  work 

B.  Limitations 

This  system  may  suffer  at  remote  area  where  there  is 
problem  with  GSM  range.  Also  the  attack  from  hackers 
may create problem but using high standard of encryption 
and  availing  GSM 
transreciever  widely,  one  may 
overcome these limitations. 

VII.  APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE 

1) In  petroleum  products  distribution  our  system  looks      

for  the  control  on  product  thefts  which  is  the  most 
serious problem for the manufacturing industries. 

2) It is also possible to implement the same system for milk 
processing industries while distributing the milk and its 
products to the market. 

3) In day to day life we can see that water distribution in 
summer is also one of the problems in front of India. So 
it  is  possible  to  keep  control  on  water  distribution  in 
particular area. 

4) The  agricultural  products  like  vegetables  as  well  as 
processed  fruits  and  its  sub  products  may  be  securely 
distributed  to  the  market  using  the  same  system  we 
proposed. 

5) Also  it  is  possible  to  keep  record  of  the  distributed 
products  to  the  market;  which  is  commercially  most 
important for the industries. 

VIII.  PRACTICAL RESULTS 

Party A has requested for the 50 liter of petrol, the 
database in VB forms at the Party B get recorded. Swap the 
RFID tag against reader, keeping the position of the level 
sensor at the highest possible position, the RFID number 
and level of fuel get displayed. 

Now  Party  B  got  the  SMS  which  includes  RFID 
number of Party A. After some delay, the form shows the 
auto  update  of  database  in  VB  w.r.t  ID,  name,  location, 
date, time and amount of fuel  and it send the message back 
to the Party A in form “*01X” e.g. “*0150”. As soon as the 
message received at the Party A, the relay get opened and 
the  display  start  to  show  the  decreasing  fuel  level  since 
valve  decreases  its  position.  As  the  valve  reaches  the 
position  by  pouring  the  particular  fuel,  it  will  get 
automatically turn OFF. 

IX.  CONCLUSION 

In the world of electronics it is important to develop 
the new technology to make secure the distribution of fuel 
and keeping record of the same fuel with authorization of 
user. Our project is one idea which can change the face of 
today‟s  manual  system  of  distribution  and  data  keeping. 
The total central access of all these activities provide the 
correct approach toward security and economical need of 
the industries since industry itself can control distribution 
as well as keep the record of the same fuel from thousands 
of  miles  seated  in  office.  Also  there  is  no  option  for  the 
petrol pump or distributor to issue the fuel illegally that is 
total faithfulness of both the sides will get maintained. In 
short, this project probably can be implemented for the use 
of other tasks other than petrol distribution, on large scale 
to achieve various goals of industries.

Abstract—  The  petroleum  products  are  one  of  the 
valuable and rare creations of the nature. The proper use and 
distribution is important task to survive these products. Our 
system  may  be  the  first  approach  towards  security  of 
petroleum  products  distribution  such  as  petrol,  diesel,  and 
kerosene etc. “The simple and proper use of RFID and GSM 
technologies  can  provide  total  security  for  distribution  of 
petroleum  products!”  this  our  proposed  design.  Simple 
embedded  system  and  direct  PC  interface  for  the  system 
which  facilitates  the  record  keeping  of  the  distributed  fuel. 
Also  the  handy  and  robust  VB  program  will  help  to 
authorized company to control the distribution of fuel whole 
over the region or country. In our system the control unit and 
tanker unit are two main parts. The two systems which may 
far away from each other can easily communicate with each 
other. The security code in RFID tag provided to the petrol 
pump  get  read  by  the  reader  and  transmission  of  it  to  the 
control  unit  will  helps  to  company  to  create  the  proper 
database of various petrol pumps distributed over wide area. 
Also the distribution of  the  fuel  is  not  possible  until  control 
unit provides the proper command to the valve in tanker unit. 
In  short  the  project  we  have  developed  is  the  basic 
attachment  of  all  above  devices;  which  will  use  to  provide 
security to the fuel distribution and helps the data keeping of 
the distributed fuel. The advancement of the project to large 
scale can help financially to the industry indirectly. The main 
purpose of our project satisfies all the needs related to secure 
distribution of the industrial products.

For Control Unit 

1. Start 
2. Firstly customer will convey the RFID provided to  
     him and then the quantity of fuel required. 
3. Keep the records of the customer in the forms  
    provided in the sequence such as name, location, ID  
    and amount required. 
4. Take information from tanker unit. 
5. Receive user ID and other data from GSM 
6. Match the received id with present id. 
7. If match, send the message to the tanker unit using 
    “*01X” format and update the database by the date,    
    time of delivery and payment 
8. If match not found, send message “Unauthorized  
    user!” to tanker unit Block the valve opening using   
    “*00X” format 
9. Again follow step 4 to 8. 
10.  Stop

V.  INTERFACING 

Basic requirements for interfacing: 
1) Power supply 12V, 5V. [1] 
2) GSM module with active SIM. 
3) DB9 connector for GSM and PC connection with our  
   system. 
4) RFID reader with standard reading format. 
5) Passive tags for user identification. 
6) PC with OS Windows 98/XP/Windows  NT. 
7) Visual Studio Ver.6.0. 
8) Microsoft office pack with Microsoft access. 
9) Resistive /RF level sensor. 
10)  Confirmation Display with suitable resolution. 

VI.  ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS  

A.  Advantages 

1.  This  system  has  simple  components  and  simple            

2. 

construction of them on circuit. 
It  is  possible  to  implement  this  system  on  small 
board space also. 

3.  GSM system used in our project provides  quick 

data communication over long distance also. 

4.  RFID  system  helps  us  to  provide  the  maximum 
security to authenticate the user at minimum cost. 
 It requires very less power supply i.e. from 5V to 
12 V only, which is easily available. 

5. 

6.  Also  as  it  provides  the  central  control  on  petrol 
distribution, thus there is no question of stilling or 
to change the record of distributed fuel.  

7.  Easy to handle for distributor since only amount 
of  fuel  which  is  to  be  poured  need  to  type  on 
keypad  and 
takes  place 
automatically. 

remaining  work 

B.  Limitations 

This  system  may  suffer  at  remote  area  where  there  is 
problem  with  GSM  range.  Also  the  attack  from  hackers 
may create problem but using high standard of encryption 
and  availing  GSM 
transreciever  widely,  one  may 
overcome these limitations. 

VII.  APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE 

1) In  petroleum  products  distribution  our  system  looks      

for  the  control  on  product  thefts  which  is  the  most 
serious problem for the manufacturing industries. 

2) It is also possible to implement the same system for milk 
processing industries while distributing the milk and its 
products to the market. 

3) In day to day life we can see that water distribution in 
summer is also one of the problems in front of India. So 
it  is  possible  to  keep  control  on  water  distribution  in 
particular area. 

4) The  agricultural  products  like  vegetables  as  well  as 
processed  fruits  and  its  sub  products  may  be  securely 
distributed  to  the  market  using  the  same  system  we 
proposed. 

5) Also  it  is  possible  to  keep  record  of  the  distributed 
products  to  the  market;  which  is  commercially  most 
important for the industries. 

VIII.  PRACTICAL RESULTS 

Party A has requested for the 50 liter of petrol, the 
database in VB forms at the Party B get recorded. Swap the 
RFID tag against reader, keeping the position of the level 
sensor at the highest possible position, the RFID number 
and level of fuel get displayed. 

Now  Party  B  got  the  SMS  which  includes  RFID 
number of Party A. After some delay, the form shows the 
auto  update  of  database  in  VB  w.r.t  ID,  name,  location, 
date, time and amount of fuel  and it send the message back 
to the Party A in form “*01X” e.g. “*0150”. As soon as the 
message received at the Party A, the relay get opened and 
the  display  start  to  show  the  decreasing  fuel  level  since 
valve  decreases  its  position.  As  the  valve  reaches  the 
position  by  pouring  the  particular  fuel,  it  will  get 
automatically turn OFF. 

IX.  CONCLUSION 

In the world of electronics it is important to develop 
the new technology to make secure the distribution of fuel 
and keeping record of the same fuel with authorization of 
user. Our project is one idea which can change the face of 
today‟s  manual  system  of  distribution  and  data  keeping. 
The total central access of all these activities provide the 
correct approach toward security and economical need of 
the industries since industry itself can control distribution 
as well as keep the record of the same fuel from thousands 
of  miles  seated  in  office.  Also  there  is  no  option  for  the 
petrol pump or distributor to issue the fuel illegally that is 
total faithfulness of both the sides will get maintained. In 
short, this project probably can be implemented for the use 
of other tasks other than petrol distribution, on large scale 
to achieve various goals of industries.
