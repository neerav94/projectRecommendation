Abstract:-Today  we  are  living  in  21st  century  where  automation  is  playing  important  role  in 
human life. Home automation allows us to control household appliances like light, door, fan, AC 
etc. It also provides home security and emergency system to be activated. Home automation not 
only  refers  to  reduce  human  efforts  but  also  energy  saving  and  time  efficiency.  The  main 
objective of home automation and security is to help handicapped and old aged people who will 
enable them to control home appliances and alert them in critical situations.  
This  paper  put  forwards  the  design  of  home  automation  and  security  system  using  ARM7 
LPC2148 board. The design is based on a standalone embedded system board ARM7 LPC2148 
at  home.  Home  appliances  are  connected  to  the  ARM7  and  communication  is  established 
between the ARM7 and ARM9 with Bluetooth device. The home appliances are connected to the 
input / output ports of the embedded system board and their status is passed to the ARM7. We 
would develop an authentication to the system for authorized person to access home appliances. 
The  device  with  low  cost  and  scalable  to  less  modification  to  the  core  is  much  important.  It 
presents the design and implementation of automation system that can monitor and control home 
appliances via ARM9 S3C2440A board.

Abstract:-Today  we  are  living  in  21st  century  where  automation  is  playing  important  role  in 
human life. Home automation allows us to control household appliances like light, door, fan, AC 
etc. It also provides home security and emergency system to be activated. Home automation not 
only  refers  to  reduce  human  efforts  but  also  energy  saving  and  time  efficiency.  The  main 
objective of home automation and security is to help handicapped and old aged people who will 
enable them to control home appliances and alert them in critical situations.  
This  paper  put  forwards  the  design  of  home  automation  and  security  system  using  ARM7 
LPC2148 board. The design is based on a standalone embedded system board ARM7 LPC2148 
at  home.  Home  appliances  are  connected  to  the  ARM7  and  communication  is  established 
between the ARM7 and ARM9 with Bluetooth device. The home appliances are connected to the 
input / output ports of the embedded system board and their status is passed to the ARM7. We 
would develop an authentication to the system for authorized person to access home appliances. 
The  device  with  low  cost  and  scalable  to  less  modification  to  the  core  is  much  important.  It 
presents the design and implementation of automation system that can monitor and control home 
appliances via ARM9 S3C2440A board.

 I. INTRODUCTION   
 The  “Home  Automation”  concept  has 
existed  for  many  years.  The  terms  “Smart 
Home”,  “Intelligent  Home”  followed  and 
has  been  used  to  introduce  the  concept  of 
networking  appliances  and  devices  in  the 
house.  Home  automation  Systems  (HASs) 
represents  a  great  research  opportunity  in 
creating 
engineering, 
architecture  and  computing  (Huidobro  and 
Millan,  2004).  HASs  becoming  popular 
nowadays and enter quickly in this emerging 
market.  However,  end  users,  especially  the 
disabled  and  old  aged  due 
their 
complexity  and  cost,  do  not  always  accept

as  GSM,  WIFI,  ZIGBEE,  and  Bluetooth. 
Each of the connection has their own unique 
specifications  and  applications.  Among  the 
four popular wireless connections that often 
implemented  in  HAS  project,  Bluetooth  is 
being  chosen  with  its  suitable  capability. 
Bluetooth

A. Wince6.0 
For  this  home  automation  and  security 
system  we  are  targeting  ARM9  S3C2440A 
platform since it has huge market and open 
source.  Wince6.0  is  a  operating  system 
which  is  used    for  ARM9  devices  that 
includes    middleware  and  key  applications. 
The  Wince6.0  OS

application  starts  user  is  first  authenticated, 
if user is authorized he will be navigated to 
main screen. The main screen has a list of all 
functions  among  which  user  can  select  any 
one function which he want to control. After 
selecting a function he would be able to see 
a current status of a particular device. If user 
wishes,  he  can  enable  or  disable  intended 
device.  
The  system  is  programmed  to  auto  on/off 
lights  during  late  night  hours.  If  room 
temperature goes very high or low user  can 
manually  adjust 
fan/AC  as  per  user 
requirement.

the  program  will  search 

If they do exist, they will be listed down for 
the  user  to  select  one.  The  program  then 
checks  to  see  if  the  selected  device  is  in 
range.  It  will  then  verify  if  the  device  is  a 
Bluetooth transceiver (ARM7-MDK board). 
Now  if  there  are  no  devices  stored  in 
memory, 
for 
Bluetooth-enabled  devices  within  the  area. 
Once  discovered,  these  devices  will  be 
displayed  on  the  screen  and  also  stored  in 
memory.  Once  it  is  confirmed  that  the 
device  is  indeed  a transceiver, the  software 
will  store  the  unique  addresses  of  all  the 
controller  modules  connected  to  it,  in  this 
case  ARM7-MDK.  If  the  address  of  a 
controller module has not been saved, then it 
will  be  designated  a  number  i.e.MDK-
LAMP. Otherwise, it will be given its saved 
name  and  will  prompt the  user to  enter the 
pairing  password  for  ARM7-MDK  board. 
Upon  entering  the  correct  password,  the 
program  stores  all  connected  controller 
modules  names  inside  the  ARM9  memory, 
then only the Main Menu user interface will 
be displayed.  
The  Main  Menu  displays  three  options: 
Options, List of Lamps and Exit.  A List of 
Lamps  is  a  combination  of  one  or  more 
lights  which  have  been  preset  to  a  certain 
status or state. These states are either ON or 
OFF. There are two options to choose from 
in  the  List  of  Lamps  interface:  they  are 
either LAMP ON or LAMP OFF. When the 
certain  instruction  has  been  chosen,  the 
software will send data to the ARM7-MDK 
transceiver, which in turn will send the data 
to the controller modules.  
The List of Lamps option in the Main Menu 
will  display  the  entire  controller  modules 
saved  in  memory. The user can  modify the 
lights status from here. Options will display 
instructions  on  how  to  use  the  software. 
Lastly,  Exit  will

Abstract:-Today  we  are  living  in  21st  century  where  automation  is  playing  important  role  in 
human life. Home automation allows us to control household appliances like light, door, fan, AC 
etc. It also provides home security and emergency system to be activated. Home automation not 
only  refers  to  reduce  human  efforts  but  also  energy  saving  and  time  efficiency.  The  main 
objective of home automation and security is to help handicapped and old aged people who will 
enable them to control home appliances and alert them in critical situations.  
This  paper  put  forwards  the  design  of  home  automation  and  security  system  using  ARM7 
LPC2148 board. The design is based on a standalone embedded system board ARM7 LPC2148 
at  home.  Home  appliances  are  connected  to  the  ARM7  and  communication  is  established 
between the ARM7 and ARM9 with Bluetooth device. The home appliances are connected to the 
input / output ports of the embedded system board and their status is passed to the ARM7. We 
would develop an authentication to the system for authorized person to access home appliances. 
The  device  with  low  cost  and  scalable  to  less  modification  to  the  core  is  much  important.  It 
presents the design and implementation of automation system that can monitor and control home 
appliances via ARM9 S3C2440A board.

 I. INTRODUCTION   
 The  “Home  Automation”  concept  has 
existed  for  many  years.  The  terms  “Smart 
Home”,  “Intelligent  Home”  followed  and 
has  been  used  to  introduce  the  concept  of 
networking  appliances  and  devices  in  the 
house.  Home  automation  Systems  (HASs) 
represents  a  great  research  opportunity  in 
creating 
engineering, 
architecture  and  computing  (Huidobro  and 
Millan,  2004).  HASs  becoming  popular 
nowadays and enter quickly in this emerging 
market.  However,  end  users,  especially  the 
disabled  and  old  aged  due 
their 
complexity  and  cost,  do  not  always  accept

wireless 
there  are  several 
different of connections are introduced such 
as  GSM,  WIFI,  ZIGBEE,  and  Bluetooth. 
Each of the connection has their own unique 
specifications  and  applications.  Among  the 
four popular wireless connections that often 
implemented  in  HAS  project,  Bluetooth  is 
being  chosen  with  its  suitable  capability. 
Bluetooth

II. IMPLEMENTATION  
A. Wince6.0 
For  this  home  automation  and  security 
system  we  are  targeting  ARM9  S3C2440A 
platform since it has huge market and open 
source.  Wince6.0  is  a  operating  system 
which  is  used    for  ARM9  devices  that 
includes    middleware  and  key  applications. 
The  Wince6.0  OS 
on  
WindowsCE.net  5.0Standard.  The  ARM9 
provides  the  tools  and  APIs  necessary  to 
begin  developing  applications  on 
the 
Wince6.0 platform.

As  discussed  earlier  we  are  developing 
graphical user interface(GUI) application by 
using  visual  basics  .net.  The  application 
consists  of  main 
light 
controlling, Door controlling, etc. When the 
application  starts  user  is  first  authenticated, 
if user is authorized he will be navigated to 
main screen. The main screen has a list of all 
functions  among  which  user  can  select  any 
one function which he want to control. After 
selecting a function he would be able to see 
a current status of a particular device. If user 
wishes,  he  can  enable  or  disable  intended 
device.  
The  system  is  programmed  to  auto  on/off 
lights  during  late  night  hours.  If  room 
temperature goes very high or low user  can 
manually  adjust 
fan/AC  as  per  user 
requirement.

If they do exist, they will be listed down for 
the  user  to  select  one.  The  program  then 
checks  to  see  if  the  selected  device  is  in 
range.  It  will  then  verify  if  the  device  is  a 
Bluetooth transceiver (ARM7-MDK board). 
Now  if  there  are  no  devices  stored  in 
memory, 
for 
Bluetooth-enabled  devices  within  the  area. 
Once  discovered,  these  devices  will  be 
displayed  on  the  screen  and  also  stored  in 
memory.  Once  it  is  confirmed  that  the 
device  is  indeed  a transceiver, the  software 
will  store  the  unique  addresses  of  all  the 
controller  modules  connected  to  it,  in  this 
case  ARM7-MDK.  If  the  address  of  a 
controller module has not been saved, then it 
will  be  designated  a  number  i.e.MDK-
LAMP. Otherwise, it will be given its saved 
name  and  will  prompt the  user to  enter the 
pairing  password  for  ARM7-MDK  board. 
Upon  entering  the  correct  password,  the 
program  stores  all  connected  controller 
modules  names  inside  the  ARM9  memory, 
then only the Main Menu user interface will 
be displayed.  
The  Main  Menu  displays  three  options: 
Options, List of Lamps and Exit.  A List of 
Lamps  is  a  combination  of  one  or  more 
lights  which  have  been  preset  to  a  certain 
status or state. These states are either ON or 
OFF. There are two options to choose from 
in  the  List  of  Lamps  interface:  they  are 
either LAMP ON or LAMP OFF. When the 
certain  instruction  has  been  chosen,  the 
software will send data to the ARM7-MDK 
transceiver, which in turn will send the data 
to the controller modules.  
The List of Lamps option in the Main Menu 
will  display  the  entire  controller  modules 
saved  in  memory. The user can  modify the 
lights status from here. Options will display 
instructions  on  how  to  use  the  software. 
Lastly,  Exit  will 
let  the  user  end  the 
program.
