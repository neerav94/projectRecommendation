Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of

rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-

abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section
5 discusses about the defensive measures of WSN directing
three important security aspects which are cryptography and

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

processing overhead, it is more desirable than excessive
communication.

• desynchronization attack

In desynchronization attack, an attacker repeatedly
forges messages to one or both end points of an active
connection with fake sequence number or control ﬂag.
Thus attackers desynchronize the end points so that sen-
sor nodes retransmit messages and waste their energy.
One countermeasure against this attack is to authenti-
cate all the packets exchanged between sensor nodes
along with all the control ﬁelds in transport header. The
adversary cannot spoof the packets and header and thus
this attack can be prevented.

4.2.5 Application Layer

In application layer, data is collected and manages. Here,
sensor nodes can be subverted to reveal its information in-
cluding disclosure of cryptographic keys hence compromis-
ing the whole sensor network. Moreover, a node can be com-
promised to malfunction and generate inaccurate data and
this effect can be worse enough when the node is a cluster
leader in WSN [24].

If a node is compromised, detection and exclusion of that
node from the sensor network is a probable solution. LEAP
[28] can verify whether a node has been compromised or not
and can revoke compromised nodes with efﬁcient re keying
mechanism.

5 WSN Defenses and Related Works

It is very hard to accumulate all the security requirements in
a single security mechanism as the WSN has severe resource
constraints and it has no predeﬁned infrastructure. Lots of re-
search have been done and are on going to privilege the WSN
with crucial security support. WSN needs effective, energy
and resource efﬁcient key management scheme for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality, integrity and authentication security ser-
vices. Link layer security mechanism in WSN can provide
important security support by guaranteeing integrity, authen-
ticity, and conﬁdentiality of messages because they deny an
outsider access to the network. Secure routing is another es-
sential requirement for protecting WSN against external and
insider attack. Proper security solution for preventing DoS
attacks at different layers is also a dire need for protecting
the WSN from disruption. This section discusses on cryp-
tography and key establishment for WSN and then some se-
curity mechanisms regarding link layer and routing security
of WSN are explored in some detail.

5.1 Cryptography
Cryptography is essential for ensuring security services.
Public key cryptography such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agree-
ment protocol or RSA signature is not suitable for WSN be-
cause of its limitation in memory, computation and power.
For example, to perform a single security operation RSA ex-
ecutes thousands or even millions of multiplication instruc-
tions. In wireless devices with limited facilities, for encryp-

tion and decryption RSA requires on the order of tens of sec-
onds and up to minutes [4]. Whereas, symmetric cryptogra-
phy and hash functions are faster and more computationally
efﬁcient than public key algorithms. That is why, most secu-
rity schemes and security researches for WSN are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

5.2 Key Distribution / Management
One major problem of symmetric cryptography is how to dis-
tribute shared key to communicating nodes. Another prob-
lem is to keep shared key secret only between the communi-
cating hosts so that adversary’s can not get reach of it. This
is why, besides light weight cipher, efﬁcient key distribution
and key management are fundamental security requirements
for WSN. Self organization is an important aspect of WSN
as the sensor nodes are deployed without following any pre
established structure. For example, some times sensor nodes
are just airdropped in enemies’ arena. In such situations, sen-
sor nodes organize themselves to form a wireless network.
Key pre-distribution is a key management scheme where be-
fore deployment each sensor node is provided with some
keys and after reaching the target position the sensor nodes
builds up a secure network among them based on those keys.
Another important aspect of WSN is in network processing
as it provides energy efﬁciency to WSN. In this case, WSN
is divided into number of clusters, data is collected and pro-
cessed by an aggregator node of each cluster and then trans-
mitted to another aggregator forming a hierarchy and this
data fusion saves energy of WSN. Here passive participation
is another aspect, in which sensor nodes take actions based
on messages from other nodes. In such cases, hierarchical
key management is required to provide security in different
level of communication in WSN. The following discussion is
on some works based on these two types of key management
protocol.

5.2.1 Key Pre-distribution Key Management

Eschenauer and Gligor in [7] introduced a random key pre-
distribution scheme where the key distribution is divided into
three phases which are key pre-distribution, shared-key dis-
covery, and path-key establishment. In key pre-distribution
stage, a large pool of S keys and associated identiﬁers for
each key are generated. Then from that key pool a num-
ber of key rings are generated by randomly drawing k keys
along with their identiﬁers for each key ring and then each
sensor node is given a key ring. The base station stores the
key rings of each node and the associated node identiﬁers.
Also, each sensor node shares a pair wise key with the base
station. In shared key discovery phase, after the deployment,
each node broadcasts a list α, EKi(α) ; i= 1,. . . ,k where α
is a challenge.
In the communication range of the broad-
casting node if a receiving node can decrypt EKi(α) with
the proper key from its key chain then the broadcasting node
and that receiver node establish a secure link between them
with that shared key. If two sensor nodes which do not share
a common key but want to communicate and are at two or
more links away, then they can get a path-key in path estab-
lishment phase. If a node is compromised, the base station
sends a message containing the identiﬁer list of the keys of

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section
5 discusses about the defensive measures of WSN directing
three important security aspects which are cryptography and

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

processing overhead, it is more desirable than excessive
communication.

• desynchronization attack

In desynchronization attack, an attacker repeatedly
forges messages to one or both end points of an active
connection with fake sequence number or control ﬂag.
Thus attackers desynchronize the end points so that sen-
sor nodes retransmit messages and waste their energy.
One countermeasure against this attack is to authenti-
cate all the packets exchanged between sensor nodes
along with all the control ﬁelds in transport header. The
adversary cannot spoof the packets and header and thus
this attack can be prevented.

4.2.5 Application Layer

In application layer, data is collected and manages. Here,
sensor nodes can be subverted to reveal its information in-
cluding disclosure of cryptographic keys hence compromis-
ing the whole sensor network. Moreover, a node can be com-
promised to malfunction and generate inaccurate data and
this effect can be worse enough when the node is a cluster
leader in WSN [24].

If a node is compromised, detection and exclusion of that
node from the sensor network is a probable solution. LEAP
[28] can verify whether a node has been compromised or not
and can revoke compromised nodes with efﬁcient re keying
mechanism.

5 WSN Defenses and Related Works

It is very hard to accumulate all the security requirements in
a single security mechanism as the WSN has severe resource
constraints and it has no predeﬁned infrastructure. Lots of re-
search have been done and are on going to privilege the WSN
with crucial security support. WSN needs effective, energy
and resource efﬁcient key management scheme for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality, integrity and authentication security ser-
vices. Link layer security mechanism in WSN can provide
important security support by guaranteeing integrity, authen-
ticity, and conﬁdentiality of messages because they deny an
outsider access to the network. Secure routing is another es-
sential requirement for protecting WSN against external and
insider attack. Proper security solution for preventing DoS
attacks at different layers is also a dire need for protecting
the WSN from disruption. This section discusses on cryp-
tography and key establishment for WSN and then some se-
curity mechanisms regarding link layer and routing security
of WSN are explored in some detail.

5.1 Cryptography
Cryptography is essential for ensuring security services.
Public key cryptography such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agree-
ment protocol or RSA signature is not suitable for WSN be-
cause of its limitation in memory, computation and power.
For example, to perform a single security operation RSA ex-
ecutes thousands or even millions of multiplication instruc-
tions. In wireless devices with limited facilities, for encryp-

tion and decryption RSA requires on the order of tens of sec-
onds and up to minutes [4]. Whereas, symmetric cryptogra-
phy and hash functions are faster and more computationally
efﬁcient than public key algorithms. That is why, most secu-
rity schemes and security researches for WSN are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

5.2 Key Distribution / Management
One major problem of symmetric cryptography is how to dis-
tribute shared key to communicating nodes. Another prob-
lem is to keep shared key secret only between the communi-
cating hosts so that adversary’s can not get reach of it. This
is why, besides light weight cipher, efﬁcient key distribution
and key management are fundamental security requirements
for WSN. Self organization is an important aspect of WSN
as the sensor nodes are deployed without following any pre
established structure. For example, some times sensor nodes
are just airdropped in enemies’ arena. In such situations, sen-
sor nodes organize themselves to form a wireless network.
Key pre-distribution is a key management scheme where be-
fore deployment each sensor node is provided with some
keys and after reaching the target position the sensor nodes
builds up a secure network among them based on those keys.
Another important aspect of WSN is in network processing
as it provides energy efﬁciency to WSN. In this case, WSN
is divided into number of clusters, data is collected and pro-
cessed by an aggregator node of each cluster and then trans-
mitted to another aggregator forming a hierarchy and this
data fusion saves energy of WSN. Here passive participation
is another aspect, in which sensor nodes take actions based
on messages from other nodes. In such cases, hierarchical
key management is required to provide security in different
level of communication in WSN. The following discussion is
on some works based on these two types of key management
protocol.

5.2.1 Key Pre-distribution Key Management

Eschenauer and Gligor in [7] introduced a random key pre-
distribution scheme where the key distribution is divided into
three phases which are key pre-distribution, shared-key dis-
covery, and path-key establishment. In key pre-distribution
stage, a large pool of S keys and associated identiﬁers for
each key are generated. Then from that key pool a num-
ber of key rings are generated by randomly drawing k keys
along with their identiﬁers for each key ring and then each
sensor node is given a key ring. The base station stores the
key rings of each node and the associated node identiﬁers.
Also, each sensor node shares a pair wise key with the base
station. In shared key discovery phase, after the deployment,
each node broadcasts a list α, EKi(α) ; i= 1,. . . ,k where α
is a challenge.
In the communication range of the broad-
casting node if a receiving node can decrypt EKi(α) with
the proper key from its key chain then the broadcasting node
and that receiver node establish a secure link between them
with that shared key. If two sensor nodes which do not share
a common key but want to communicate and are at two or
more links away, then they can get a path-key in path estab-
lishment phase. If a node is compromised, the base station
sends a message containing the identiﬁer list of the keys of

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the compromised node’s key chain to all the nodes encrypt-
ing with the pair wise keys shared with them. The nodes in
the network can then delete the corresponding key from their
key chain. This scheme is also known as basic scheme.

In this key management scheme if the size of the network
grows, each node in the network needs to store only a few
keys, which is memory efﬁcient and provides scalability.
Again, when a node is compromised, the probability of an
attacker to successfully attack a node is k/S where k«S. So,
in key revocation process much communication overhead is
not introduced as a small number of nodes are affected. But,
this scheme is not able to provide node to node authentica-
tion which is a requirement to protect node replication attack
(i.e, sybil attack).

Chan et al. in [6] proposed Q-Composite Scheme, which
was introduced to increase the resilience of the network
against node capture than basic scheme. Here in this scheme,
in shared key discovery phase, to establish a secure link two
nodes require at least q common keys in their key rings in-
stead of a single common key as in basic scheme. Accord-
ing to the authors’ observation this property increases the
resilience to node capture when a small number of nodes are
compromised. However, this scheme performs badly when
more nodes are compromised as same keys are used repeat-
edly in a network. But, usually adversaries ﬁrst try to attack
in small scale and if they succeed then they proceed for large
scale attack. So, this scheme is reasonable to protect small
scale attack and thus preventing large scale one. This scheme
also cannot provide node to node authentication and if an at-
tacker performs large scale attack the security of the network
breaks down under this scheme.

Chan et al. in [6] also proposed a multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme for WSN where security is more important than
bandwidth or power drain. The problem in basic scheme is
that the common key which establishes a security link be-
tween two nodes A and B, may reside in the memory of other
nodes in the network and by capturing those nodes an adver-
sary can attack that secure link between A and B. So, Chan et
al. introduced a key update phase in multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme.
In this case, A generates random j random
values (v1, v2,. . . ,vj) where j is the number of disjoint paths
available from A to B. Then A sends each random value
along a different disjoint path. After receiving all the ran-
dom values, B generates a new key by doing XOR the origi-
nal key with all the random values. If an adversary wants to
reconstruct the communication key he needs to eavesdrop all
the j disjoint paths. The disadvantage of this scheme is that
it introduces communication overhead which may exhaust
nodes battery life and may give chance adversaries to launch
DOS attack. Chan et al. further extended their research by
proposing random pairwise key scheme to provide node to
node authentication.

5.2.2 Hierarchical Key Management

Zhu et al. [28] proposed Localized Encryption and Authen-
tication Protocol (LEAP) for WSN which is a key manage-
ment protocol. LEAP provides different security require-
ments for different types of messages exchanged between
sensor nodes. For this purpose, LEAP introduces 4 types of

keys for each sensor node which are individual key, pairwise
shared key, group key and cluster key.

Each sensor node has a unique key named individual key
which is shared with the base station to secure the messages
between a sensor node and the base station. Example of such
messages are alert message of abnormal observation about
neighboring node from a sensor node to base station, key-
ing material or special instruction for a node from the base
station and so on.

Pairwise shared key is a unique key which is shared be-
tween each node and its neighboring node. This key pro-
vides security when a node wants to share cluster key with
its neighbor or a node sends data to the aggregator node. This
key is also used to provide efﬁcient node to node authentica-
tion.

Group key is shared among all the nodes in the network
and the base station uses this key to provide security of
broadcast message sent to the whole group. For example, the
base station encrypts the missions, queries and interests with
this key and broadcasts the encrypted message. As this key is
shared among all the nodes, there is a chance that an adver-
sary can get the key by compromising a node. So, LEAP also
provides efﬁcient rekeying mechanism for updating group
key to solve this problem.

Cluster key is a key shared by a node and all its neigh-
bors. This key secures locally broadcast message and sup-
ports in network processing and passive participation. For
example, when a node locally broadcast the sensor message
by securing with this key, the neighbor nodes can take deci-
sion whether to send the same message or not by decrypting
or authenticating that message.

LEAP can minimize the effect of selective forwarding at-
tack as it uses local broadcast, thereby the effect of this at-
tack cannot be transferred more than 2 hops away. LEAP
can prevent HELLO Flood attack as the node accepts packets
only from its authenticated neighbor. LEAP can also prevent
Sybil attack by providing unique ID authentication for each
node. Again, after key establishment as each node has the
knowledge about its neighbors, it is not easy for and adviser
to convince a node that it is near to a particular compromised
node, thereby Worm Whole attack is discouraged. The dis-
advantage of this scheme is that memory for each node to
store 4 types of keys as well as computation and communi-
cation overhead increase if the density of WSN increases.

5.3 Link Layer Security
TinySec [11] works at link layer and provides access con-
trol, message authencity, integrity and message conﬁdential-
ity. TinySec provides message security using cryptographic
primitives- encryption and MAC. TinySec supports two dif-
ferent security options: authenticated encryption (TinySec-
AE) and authentication only (TinySec-Auth).
In TinySec-
AE, TinySec encrypts the data payload and authenticates the
packet with a MAC. With TinySec-Auth, the packet authenti-
cation is performed with a MAC without encrypting the data
payload.

For encryption, TinySec uses an 8 byte IV and cipher
block chaining (CBC). One problem here is that if IV re-
peats it can introduce security leakage. This is why CBC

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section
5 discusses about the defensive measures of WSN directing
three important security aspects which are cryptography and

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

processing overhead, it is more desirable than excessive
communication.

• desynchronization attack

In desynchronization attack, an attacker repeatedly
forges messages to one or both end points of an active
connection with fake sequence number or control ﬂag.
Thus attackers desynchronize the end points so that sen-
sor nodes retransmit messages and waste their energy.
One countermeasure against this attack is to authenti-
cate all the packets exchanged between sensor nodes
along with all the control ﬁelds in transport header. The
adversary cannot spoof the packets and header and thus
this attack can be prevented.

4.2.5 Application Layer

In application layer, data is collected and manages. Here,
sensor nodes can be subverted to reveal its information in-
cluding disclosure of cryptographic keys hence compromis-
ing the whole sensor network. Moreover, a node can be com-
promised to malfunction and generate inaccurate data and
this effect can be worse enough when the node is a cluster
leader in WSN [24].

If a node is compromised, detection and exclusion of that
node from the sensor network is a probable solution. LEAP
[28] can verify whether a node has been compromised or not
and can revoke compromised nodes with efﬁcient re keying
mechanism.

5 WSN Defenses and Related Works

It is very hard to accumulate all the security requirements in
a single security mechanism as the WSN has severe resource
constraints and it has no predeﬁned infrastructure. Lots of re-
search have been done and are on going to privilege the WSN
with crucial security support. WSN needs effective, energy
and resource efﬁcient key management scheme for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality, integrity and authentication security ser-
vices. Link layer security mechanism in WSN can provide
important security support by guaranteeing integrity, authen-
ticity, and conﬁdentiality of messages because they deny an
outsider access to the network. Secure routing is another es-
sential requirement for protecting WSN against external and
insider attack. Proper security solution for preventing DoS
attacks at different layers is also a dire need for protecting
the WSN from disruption. This section discusses on cryp-
tography and key establishment for WSN and then some se-
curity mechanisms regarding link layer and routing security
of WSN are explored in some detail.

5.1 Cryptography
Cryptography is essential for ensuring security services.
Public key cryptography such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agree-
ment protocol or RSA signature is not suitable for WSN be-
cause of its limitation in memory, computation and power.
For example, to perform a single security operation RSA ex-
ecutes thousands or even millions of multiplication instruc-
tions. In wireless devices with limited facilities, for encryp-

tion and decryption RSA requires on the order of tens of sec-
onds and up to minutes [4]. Whereas, symmetric cryptogra-
phy and hash functions are faster and more computationally
efﬁcient than public key algorithms. That is why, most secu-
rity schemes and security researches for WSN are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

5.2 Key Distribution / Management
One major problem of symmetric cryptography is how to dis-
tribute shared key to communicating nodes. Another prob-
lem is to keep shared key secret only between the communi-
cating hosts so that adversary’s can not get reach of it. This
is why, besides light weight cipher, efﬁcient key distribution
and key management are fundamental security requirements
for WSN. Self organization is an important aspect of WSN
as the sensor nodes are deployed without following any pre
established structure. For example, some times sensor nodes
are just airdropped in enemies’ arena. In such situations, sen-
sor nodes organize themselves to form a wireless network.
Key pre-distribution is a key management scheme where be-
fore deployment each sensor node is provided with some
keys and after reaching the target position the sensor nodes
builds up a secure network among them based on those keys.
Another important aspect of WSN is in network processing
as it provides energy efﬁciency to WSN. In this case, WSN
is divided into number of clusters, data is collected and pro-
cessed by an aggregator node of each cluster and then trans-
mitted to another aggregator forming a hierarchy and this
data fusion saves energy of WSN. Here passive participation
is another aspect, in which sensor nodes take actions based
on messages from other nodes. In such cases, hierarchical
key management is required to provide security in different
level of communication in WSN. The following discussion is
on some works based on these two types of key management
protocol.

5.2.1 Key Pre-distribution Key Management

Eschenauer and Gligor in [7] introduced a random key pre-
distribution scheme where the key distribution is divided into
three phases which are key pre-distribution, shared-key dis-
covery, and path-key establishment. In key pre-distribution
stage, a large pool of S keys and associated identiﬁers for
each key are generated. Then from that key pool a num-
ber of key rings are generated by randomly drawing k keys
along with their identiﬁers for each key ring and then each
sensor node is given a key ring. The base station stores the
key rings of each node and the associated node identiﬁers.
Also, each sensor node shares a pair wise key with the base
station. In shared key discovery phase, after the deployment,
each node broadcasts a list α, EKi(α) ; i= 1,. . . ,k where α
is a challenge.
In the communication range of the broad-
casting node if a receiving node can decrypt EKi(α) with
the proper key from its key chain then the broadcasting node
and that receiver node establish a secure link between them
with that shared key. If two sensor nodes which do not share
a common key but want to communicate and are at two or
more links away, then they can get a path-key in path estab-
lishment phase. If a node is compromised, the base station
sends a message containing the identiﬁer list of the keys of

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the compromised node’s key chain to all the nodes encrypt-
ing with the pair wise keys shared with them. The nodes in
the network can then delete the corresponding key from their
key chain. This scheme is also known as basic scheme.

In this key management scheme if the size of the network
grows, each node in the network needs to store only a few
keys, which is memory efﬁcient and provides scalability.
Again, when a node is compromised, the probability of an
attacker to successfully attack a node is k/S where k«S. So,
in key revocation process much communication overhead is
not introduced as a small number of nodes are affected. But,
this scheme is not able to provide node to node authentica-
tion which is a requirement to protect node replication attack
(i.e, sybil attack).

Chan et al. in [6] proposed Q-Composite Scheme, which
was introduced to increase the resilience of the network
against node capture than basic scheme. Here in this scheme,
in shared key discovery phase, to establish a secure link two
nodes require at least q common keys in their key rings in-
stead of a single common key as in basic scheme. Accord-
ing to the authors’ observation this property increases the
resilience to node capture when a small number of nodes are
compromised. However, this scheme performs badly when
more nodes are compromised as same keys are used repeat-
edly in a network. But, usually adversaries ﬁrst try to attack
in small scale and if they succeed then they proceed for large
scale attack. So, this scheme is reasonable to protect small
scale attack and thus preventing large scale one. This scheme
also cannot provide node to node authentication and if an at-
tacker performs large scale attack the security of the network
breaks down under this scheme.

Chan et al. in [6] also proposed a multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme for WSN where security is more important than
bandwidth or power drain. The problem in basic scheme is
that the common key which establishes a security link be-
tween two nodes A and B, may reside in the memory of other
nodes in the network and by capturing those nodes an adver-
sary can attack that secure link between A and B. So, Chan et
al. introduced a key update phase in multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme.
In this case, A generates random j random
values (v1, v2,. . . ,vj) where j is the number of disjoint paths
available from A to B. Then A sends each random value
along a different disjoint path. After receiving all the ran-
dom values, B generates a new key by doing XOR the origi-
nal key with all the random values. If an adversary wants to
reconstruct the communication key he needs to eavesdrop all
the j disjoint paths. The disadvantage of this scheme is that
it introduces communication overhead which may exhaust
nodes battery life and may give chance adversaries to launch
DOS attack. Chan et al. further extended their research by
proposing random pairwise key scheme to provide node to
node authentication.

5.2.2 Hierarchical Key Management

Zhu et al. [28] proposed Localized Encryption and Authen-
tication Protocol (LEAP) for WSN which is a key manage-
ment protocol. LEAP provides different security require-
ments for different types of messages exchanged between
sensor nodes. For this purpose, LEAP introduces 4 types of

keys for each sensor node which are individual key, pairwise
shared key, group key and cluster key.

Each sensor node has a unique key named individual key
which is shared with the base station to secure the messages
between a sensor node and the base station. Example of such
messages are alert message of abnormal observation about
neighboring node from a sensor node to base station, key-
ing material or special instruction for a node from the base
station and so on.

Pairwise shared key is a unique key which is shared be-
tween each node and its neighboring node. This key pro-
vides security when a node wants to share cluster key with
its neighbor or a node sends data to the aggregator node. This
key is also used to provide efﬁcient node to node authentica-
tion.

Group key is shared among all the nodes in the network
and the base station uses this key to provide security of
broadcast message sent to the whole group. For example, the
base station encrypts the missions, queries and interests with
this key and broadcasts the encrypted message. As this key is
shared among all the nodes, there is a chance that an adver-
sary can get the key by compromising a node. So, LEAP also
provides efﬁcient rekeying mechanism for updating group
key to solve this problem.

Cluster key is a key shared by a node and all its neigh-
bors. This key secures locally broadcast message and sup-
ports in network processing and passive participation. For
example, when a node locally broadcast the sensor message
by securing with this key, the neighbor nodes can take deci-
sion whether to send the same message or not by decrypting
or authenticating that message.

LEAP can minimize the effect of selective forwarding at-
tack as it uses local broadcast, thereby the effect of this at-
tack cannot be transferred more than 2 hops away. LEAP
can prevent HELLO Flood attack as the node accepts packets
only from its authenticated neighbor. LEAP can also prevent
Sybil attack by providing unique ID authentication for each
node. Again, after key establishment as each node has the
knowledge about its neighbors, it is not easy for and adviser
to convince a node that it is near to a particular compromised
node, thereby Worm Whole attack is discouraged. The dis-
advantage of this scheme is that memory for each node to
store 4 types of keys as well as computation and communi-
cation overhead increase if the density of WSN increases.

5.3 Link Layer Security
TinySec [11] works at link layer and provides access con-
trol, message authencity, integrity and message conﬁdential-
ity. TinySec provides message security using cryptographic
primitives- encryption and MAC. TinySec supports two dif-
ferent security options: authenticated encryption (TinySec-
AE) and authentication only (TinySec-Auth).
In TinySec-
AE, TinySec encrypts the data payload and authenticates the
packet with a MAC. With TinySec-Auth, the packet authenti-
cation is performed with a MAC without encrypting the data
payload.

For encryption, TinySec uses an 8 byte IV and cipher
block chaining (CBC). One problem here is that if IV re-
peats it can introduce security leakage. This is why CBC

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

mode is used here as with the same IV under CBC mode the
cipher text will leak only the length (in blocks) of the longest
shared preﬁx of the two plaintexts. For providing message
integrity, TinySec uses a cipher block chaining construction,
CBC-MAC with 4 byte output for computing and verifying
MACs. With a 4 byte MAC if an adversary tries to inject
a malicious packet into the network, he will succeed after
231 tries. Even If an adversary tries to do so, implementing
a simple mechanism that nodes will signal the base station
when the rate of MAC failures exceeds some predetermined
threshold can prevent such attempts. TinySec also provides
the ﬂexibility of using any keying mechanism. The draw-
back for implementing TinySec is that TinySec packets are
one to ﬁve bytes longer than normal WSN packets which
may reduce bandwidth and increase latency and energy con-
sumption.

5.4 Secure Routing

In conventional networks the routing protocols mainly con-
cern about the reliable delivery of messages. Message secu-
rity (i.e. conﬁdentiality, integration and authentication) and
protection against DOS attacks are performed by end to end
mechanisms such as SSL or SSH. As end to end communica-
tion is the main concern, there is no need for the intermediate
routers to know the content of the message except the nec-
essary headers. But, the scenario is different in WSN where
in many cases intermediate nodes need to communicate with
each other for providing in network processing or data ag-
gregation before sending the message to the base station. In
this case, intermediate nodes have the ability to modify, sup-
press or eavesdrop the message content and compromised
node can exploit the features of routing protocol to cause po-
tential damage of working functionality of the network. So,
for WSN, routing protocols must be designed taking security
also as a goal. For facilitating routing protocols with secu-
rity mechanisms key management for each sensor node is an
essential part which has been discussed in the previous text.
The following text is on some secure routing mechanisms for
WSN.

[9] proposed a routing protocol directed diffusion for
WSN which is energy, bandwidth and memory efﬁcient
highly desirable for WSN. But this protocol is not able to
afford secure group communication that is the communica-
tion between sink and sources. Pietro et al. in [21] extended
this directed diffusion protocol to incorporate security in it.
They extended the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) for facil-
itating secure multicast and merged this extension with di-
rected diffusion and named their scheme as LKHW. LKHW
gives robustness in communication and enforces both back-
ward and forward secrecy. But, it cannot provide data au-
thentication.

Nasser et al in [18] proposed SEER: Secure and Energy-
Efﬁcient multipath Routing protocol in which base station
performs the route discovery, maintenance and route selec-
tion. Instead of using a single path, base station periodically
select a new path from multipath based on current energy
level of nodes along each path. Attacks on routing protocols
that attract trafﬁc by advertising high quality route to the base
station such as, Wormhole and Sinkhole can be defended by

SEER as the routing path is selected by the base station. If in
the routing path a node is compromised, the attack lasts for
limited time as the base station periodically reselects new
path. SEER can also defend selective forwarding attack as
the attacker cannot include itself in the routing path to launch
the selective forwarding attack. Again if any compromised
node selectively drops packet it can be detected by the next
hop as SEER uses sequence number that uniquely identify
each packet. But, if adversaries can breach the security of
base station they can disrupt the whole network.

Perrig et al.

[20] present SPINS which comprises two
security building blocks optimized to use in WSN which
are SNEP and µTESLA. SNEP provides semantic security,
data authentication, replay protection and weak freshness by
implementing symmetric cryptographic primitives such as
MAC, and encryption with RC5. Before encrypting the mes-
sage sender attaches a random bit string with the message
and this property provides semantic security, replay protec-
tion and weak freshness. For excluding extra communication
overhead of sending this extra random bit with each message,
SNEP shares a counter between the communicating nodes
for the block cipher in counter mode (CTR). The communi-
cating parties increment the shared counter after each block.
Data authentication is achieved by verifying the MAC value
of the message.

µTESLA provides authenticated broadcast for WSN from
symmetric primitives, but introduces asymmetry with de-
layed key disclosure and one-way function key chains.
µTESLA uses a loosely synchronized timer on both the base
station and other nodes to authenticate the MAC key. The
base station computes a MAC on a packet with a key which
is secret at that certain time to send the packet as authenti-
cated. When a node receives a packet it can verify that the
base station has not yet disclosed the corresponding MAC
key. So, it stores the packet in its buffer until for the next key
disclosure of the base station. After having the disclosed key,
the node veriﬁes the correctness of the key and authenticates
the packet which it stored in buffer for authentication before
key disclosure. As µTESLA incorporates the mechanism to
verify the MAC key of base station by sensor nodes, sensor
nodes are assured that no adversary could alter the packet
in transit. But, the broadcast here is limited to the base sta-
tion. If any node wants to broadcast it has to do that via base
station.

6 Conclusion

With super small sensor nodes, super low power consump-
tion and alluring low cost, Wireless Sensor Network is at-
tracting uncountable application domains to sense and col-
lect data. But, these attractive features made Wireless Sensor
Network challenging to integrate security mechanism into it.
This paper gives an idea of a major subset of security prob-
lems that Wireless Sensor Network faces because of its ex-

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section
5 discusses about the defensive measures of WSN directing
three important security aspects which are cryptography and

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

processing overhead, it is more desirable than excessive
communication.

• desynchronization attack

In desynchronization attack, an attacker repeatedly
forges messages to one or both end points of an active
connection with fake sequence number or control ﬂag.
Thus attackers desynchronize the end points so that sen-
sor nodes retransmit messages and waste their energy.
One countermeasure against this attack is to authenti-
cate all the packets exchanged between sensor nodes
along with all the control ﬁelds in transport header. The
adversary cannot spoof the packets and header and thus
this attack can be prevented.

4.2.5 Application Layer

In application layer, data is collected and manages. Here,
sensor nodes can be subverted to reveal its information in-
cluding disclosure of cryptographic keys hence compromis-
ing the whole sensor network. Moreover, a node can be com-
promised to malfunction and generate inaccurate data and
this effect can be worse enough when the node is a cluster
leader in WSN [24].

If a node is compromised, detection and exclusion of that
node from the sensor network is a probable solution. LEAP
[28] can verify whether a node has been compromised or not
and can revoke compromised nodes with efﬁcient re keying
mechanism.

5 WSN Defenses and Related Works

It is very hard to accumulate all the security requirements in
a single security mechanism as the WSN has severe resource
constraints and it has no predeﬁned infrastructure. Lots of re-
search have been done and are on going to privilege the WSN
with crucial security support. WSN needs effective, energy
and resource efﬁcient key management scheme for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality, integrity and authentication security ser-
vices. Link layer security mechanism in WSN can provide
important security support by guaranteeing integrity, authen-
ticity, and conﬁdentiality of messages because they deny an
outsider access to the network. Secure routing is another es-
sential requirement for protecting WSN against external and
insider attack. Proper security solution for preventing DoS
attacks at different layers is also a dire need for protecting
the WSN from disruption. This section discusses on cryp-
tography and key establishment for WSN and then some se-
curity mechanisms regarding link layer and routing security
of WSN are explored in some detail.

5.1 Cryptography
Cryptography is essential for ensuring security services.
Public key cryptography such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agree-
ment protocol or RSA signature is not suitable for WSN be-
cause of its limitation in memory, computation and power.
For example, to perform a single security operation RSA ex-
ecutes thousands or even millions of multiplication instruc-
tions. In wireless devices with limited facilities, for encryp-

tion and decryption RSA requires on the order of tens of sec-
onds and up to minutes [4]. Whereas, symmetric cryptogra-
phy and hash functions are faster and more computationally
efﬁcient than public key algorithms. That is why, most secu-
rity schemes and security researches for WSN are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

5.2 Key Distribution / Management
One major problem of symmetric cryptography is how to dis-
tribute shared key to communicating nodes. Another prob-
lem is to keep shared key secret only between the communi-
cating hosts so that adversary’s can not get reach of it. This
is why, besides light weight cipher, efﬁcient key distribution
and key management are fundamental security requirements
for WSN. Self organization is an important aspect of WSN
as the sensor nodes are deployed without following any pre
established structure. For example, some times sensor nodes
are just airdropped in enemies’ arena. In such situations, sen-
sor nodes organize themselves to form a wireless network.
Key pre-distribution is a key management scheme where be-
fore deployment each sensor node is provided with some
keys and after reaching the target position the sensor nodes
builds up a secure network among them based on those keys.
Another important aspect of WSN is in network processing
as it provides energy efﬁciency to WSN. In this case, WSN
is divided into number of clusters, data is collected and pro-
cessed by an aggregator node of each cluster and then trans-
mitted to another aggregator forming a hierarchy and this
data fusion saves energy of WSN. Here passive participation
is another aspect, in which sensor nodes take actions based
on messages from other nodes. In such cases, hierarchical
key management is required to provide security in different
level of communication in WSN. The following discussion is
on some works based on these two types of key management
protocol.

5.2.1 Key Pre-distribution Key Management

Eschenauer and Gligor in [7] introduced a random key pre-
distribution scheme where the key distribution is divided into
three phases which are key pre-distribution, shared-key dis-
covery, and path-key establishment. In key pre-distribution
stage, a large pool of S keys and associated identiﬁers for
each key are generated. Then from that key pool a num-
ber of key rings are generated by randomly drawing k keys
along with their identiﬁers for each key ring and then each
sensor node is given a key ring. The base station stores the
key rings of each node and the associated node identiﬁers.
Also, each sensor node shares a pair wise key with the base
station. In shared key discovery phase, after the deployment,
each node broadcasts a list α, EKi(α) ; i= 1,. . . ,k where α
is a challenge.
In the communication range of the broad-
casting node if a receiving node can decrypt EKi(α) with
the proper key from its key chain then the broadcasting node
and that receiver node establish a secure link between them
with that shared key. If two sensor nodes which do not share
a common key but want to communicate and are at two or
more links away, then they can get a path-key in path estab-
lishment phase. If a node is compromised, the base station
sends a message containing the identiﬁer list of the keys of

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

the compromised node’s key chain to all the nodes encrypt-
ing with the pair wise keys shared with them. The nodes in
the network can then delete the corresponding key from their
key chain. This scheme is also known as basic scheme.

In this key management scheme if the size of the network
grows, each node in the network needs to store only a few
keys, which is memory efﬁcient and provides scalability.
Again, when a node is compromised, the probability of an
attacker to successfully attack a node is k/S where k«S. So,
in key revocation process much communication overhead is
not introduced as a small number of nodes are affected. But,
this scheme is not able to provide node to node authentica-
tion which is a requirement to protect node replication attack
(i.e, sybil attack).

Chan et al. in [6] proposed Q-Composite Scheme, which
was introduced to increase the resilience of the network
against node capture than basic scheme. Here in this scheme,
in shared key discovery phase, to establish a secure link two
nodes require at least q common keys in their key rings in-
stead of a single common key as in basic scheme. Accord-
ing to the authors’ observation this property increases the
resilience to node capture when a small number of nodes are
compromised. However, this scheme performs badly when
more nodes are compromised as same keys are used repeat-
edly in a network. But, usually adversaries ﬁrst try to attack
in small scale and if they succeed then they proceed for large
scale attack. So, this scheme is reasonable to protect small
scale attack and thus preventing large scale one. This scheme
also cannot provide node to node authentication and if an at-
tacker performs large scale attack the security of the network
breaks down under this scheme.

Chan et al. in [6] also proposed a multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme for WSN where security is more important than
bandwidth or power drain. The problem in basic scheme is
that the common key which establishes a security link be-
tween two nodes A and B, may reside in the memory of other
nodes in the network and by capturing those nodes an adver-
sary can attack that secure link between A and B. So, Chan et
al. introduced a key update phase in multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme.
In this case, A generates random j random
values (v1, v2,. . . ,vj) where j is the number of disjoint paths
available from A to B. Then A sends each random value
along a different disjoint path. After receiving all the ran-
dom values, B generates a new key by doing XOR the origi-
nal key with all the random values. If an adversary wants to
reconstruct the communication key he needs to eavesdrop all
the j disjoint paths. The disadvantage of this scheme is that
it introduces communication overhead which may exhaust
nodes battery life and may give chance adversaries to launch
DOS attack. Chan et al. further extended their research by
proposing random pairwise key scheme to provide node to
node authentication.

5.2.2 Hierarchical Key Management

Zhu et al. [28] proposed Localized Encryption and Authen-
tication Protocol (LEAP) for WSN which is a key manage-
ment protocol. LEAP provides different security require-
ments for different types of messages exchanged between
sensor nodes. For this purpose, LEAP introduces 4 types of

keys for each sensor node which are individual key, pairwise
shared key, group key and cluster key.

Each sensor node has a unique key named individual key
which is shared with the base station to secure the messages
between a sensor node and the base station. Example of such
messages are alert message of abnormal observation about
neighboring node from a sensor node to base station, key-
ing material or special instruction for a node from the base
station and so on.

Pairwise shared key is a unique key which is shared be-
tween each node and its neighboring node. This key pro-
vides security when a node wants to share cluster key with
its neighbor or a node sends data to the aggregator node. This
key is also used to provide efﬁcient node to node authentica-
tion.

Group key is shared among all the nodes in the network
and the base station uses this key to provide security of
broadcast message sent to the whole group. For example, the
base station encrypts the missions, queries and interests with
this key and broadcasts the encrypted message. As this key is
shared among all the nodes, there is a chance that an adver-
sary can get the key by compromising a node. So, LEAP also
provides efﬁcient rekeying mechanism for updating group
key to solve this problem.

Cluster key is a key shared by a node and all its neigh-
bors. This key secures locally broadcast message and sup-
ports in network processing and passive participation. For
example, when a node locally broadcast the sensor message
by securing with this key, the neighbor nodes can take deci-
sion whether to send the same message or not by decrypting
or authenticating that message.

LEAP can minimize the effect of selective forwarding at-
tack as it uses local broadcast, thereby the effect of this at-
tack cannot be transferred more than 2 hops away. LEAP
can prevent HELLO Flood attack as the node accepts packets
only from its authenticated neighbor. LEAP can also prevent
Sybil attack by providing unique ID authentication for each
node. Again, after key establishment as each node has the
knowledge about its neighbors, it is not easy for and adviser
to convince a node that it is near to a particular compromised
node, thereby Worm Whole attack is discouraged. The dis-
advantage of this scheme is that memory for each node to
store 4 types of keys as well as computation and communi-
cation overhead increase if the density of WSN increases.

5.3 Link Layer Security
TinySec [11] works at link layer and provides access con-
trol, message authencity, integrity and message conﬁdential-
ity. TinySec provides message security using cryptographic
primitives- encryption and MAC. TinySec supports two dif-
ferent security options: authenticated encryption (TinySec-
AE) and authentication only (TinySec-Auth).
In TinySec-
AE, TinySec encrypts the data payload and authenticates the
packet with a MAC. With TinySec-Auth, the packet authenti-
cation is performed with a MAC without encrypting the data
payload.

For encryption, TinySec uses an 8 byte IV and cipher
block chaining (CBC). One problem here is that if IV re-
peats it can introduce security leakage. This is why CBC

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

mode is used here as with the same IV under CBC mode the
cipher text will leak only the length (in blocks) of the longest
shared preﬁx of the two plaintexts. For providing message
integrity, TinySec uses a cipher block chaining construction,
CBC-MAC with 4 byte output for computing and verifying
MACs. With a 4 byte MAC if an adversary tries to inject
a malicious packet into the network, he will succeed after
231 tries. Even If an adversary tries to do so, implementing
a simple mechanism that nodes will signal the base station
when the rate of MAC failures exceeds some predetermined
threshold can prevent such attempts. TinySec also provides
the ﬂexibility of using any keying mechanism. The draw-
back for implementing TinySec is that TinySec packets are
one to ﬁve bytes longer than normal WSN packets which
may reduce bandwidth and increase latency and energy con-
sumption.

5.4 Secure Routing

In conventional networks the routing protocols mainly con-
cern about the reliable delivery of messages. Message secu-
rity (i.e. conﬁdentiality, integration and authentication) and
protection against DOS attacks are performed by end to end
mechanisms such as SSL or SSH. As end to end communica-
tion is the main concern, there is no need for the intermediate
routers to know the content of the message except the nec-
essary headers. But, the scenario is different in WSN where
in many cases intermediate nodes need to communicate with
each other for providing in network processing or data ag-
gregation before sending the message to the base station. In
this case, intermediate nodes have the ability to modify, sup-
press or eavesdrop the message content and compromised
node can exploit the features of routing protocol to cause po-
tential damage of working functionality of the network. So,
for WSN, routing protocols must be designed taking security
also as a goal. For facilitating routing protocols with secu-
rity mechanisms key management for each sensor node is an
essential part which has been discussed in the previous text.
The following text is on some secure routing mechanisms for
WSN.

[9] proposed a routing protocol directed diffusion for
WSN which is energy, bandwidth and memory efﬁcient
highly desirable for WSN. But this protocol is not able to
afford secure group communication that is the communica-
tion between sink and sources. Pietro et al. in [21] extended
this directed diffusion protocol to incorporate security in it.
They extended the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) for facil-
itating secure multicast and merged this extension with di-
rected diffusion and named their scheme as LKHW. LKHW
gives robustness in communication and enforces both back-
ward and forward secrecy. But, it cannot provide data au-
thentication.

Nasser et al in [18] proposed SEER: Secure and Energy-
Efﬁcient multipath Routing protocol in which base station
performs the route discovery, maintenance and route selec-
tion. Instead of using a single path, base station periodically
select a new path from multipath based on current energy
level of nodes along each path. Attacks on routing protocols
that attract trafﬁc by advertising high quality route to the base
station such as, Wormhole and Sinkhole can be defended by

SEER as the routing path is selected by the base station. If in
the routing path a node is compromised, the attack lasts for
limited time as the base station periodically reselects new
path. SEER can also defend selective forwarding attack as
the attacker cannot include itself in the routing path to launch
the selective forwarding attack. Again if any compromised
node selectively drops packet it can be detected by the next
hop as SEER uses sequence number that uniquely identify
each packet. But, if adversaries can breach the security of
base station they can disrupt the whole network.

Perrig et al.

[20] present SPINS which comprises two
security building blocks optimized to use in WSN which
are SNEP and µTESLA. SNEP provides semantic security,
data authentication, replay protection and weak freshness by
implementing symmetric cryptographic primitives such as
MAC, and encryption with RC5. Before encrypting the mes-
sage sender attaches a random bit string with the message
and this property provides semantic security, replay protec-
tion and weak freshness. For excluding extra communication
overhead of sending this extra random bit with each message,
SNEP shares a counter between the communicating nodes
for the block cipher in counter mode (CTR). The communi-
cating parties increment the shared counter after each block.
Data authentication is achieved by verifying the MAC value
of the message.

µTESLA provides authenticated broadcast for WSN from
symmetric primitives, but introduces asymmetry with de-
layed key disclosure and one-way function key chains.
µTESLA uses a loosely synchronized timer on both the base
station and other nodes to authenticate the MAC key. The
base station computes a MAC on a packet with a key which
is secret at that certain time to send the packet as authenti-
cated. When a node receives a packet it can verify that the
base station has not yet disclosed the corresponding MAC
key. So, it stores the packet in its buffer until for the next key
disclosure of the base station. After having the disclosed key,
the node veriﬁes the correctness of the key and authenticates
the packet which it stored in buffer for authentication before
key disclosure. As µTESLA incorporates the mechanism to
verify the MAC key of base station by sensor nodes, sensor
nodes are assured that no adversary could alter the packet
in transit. But, the broadcast here is limited to the base sta-
tion. If any node wants to broadcast it has to do that via base
station.

6 Conclusion

With super small sensor nodes, super low power consump-
tion and alluring low cost, Wireless Sensor Network is at-
tracting uncountable application domains to sense and col-
lect data. But, these attractive features made Wireless Sensor
Network challenging to integrate security mechanism into it.
This paper gives an idea of a major subset of security prob-
lems that Wireless Sensor Network faces because of its ex-
ceptional design characteristics, communication and deploy-
ment pattern. At the same time, this paper includes brief dis-
cussion on the important security aspects that are required to
design a secure Wire Sensor Network. Some Well known
attacks and their proposed counter measures are also dis-
cussed in this paper in order to give an idea about how the

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

adversaries can actually attack the WSN exploiting its vul-
nerabilities and what kind of security awareness should be
taken into account when incorporating security mechanisms
in WSN. Finally, this paper explores some works on three
crucial security aspects of WSN which are key management,
link layer security and secure routing. There are also many
security aspects of WSN such as secure data aggregation,
intrusion detection, secure localization, etc. which are not
covered in this paper.

There are many security solutions or mechanisms that
have been proposed for Wireless Sensor Network; some of
which are concerned about speciﬁc security attacks whereas
some are concerned about speciﬁc security aspect. There
is no standard security mechanism that can provide overall
security for WSN. Providing such mechanism is not possi-
ble also as WSNs are implemented in various application
domains with different level of security requirements. De-
signing a secure WSN needs proper mapping of security so-
lutions or mechanisms with different security aspects. This
also imposes a research challenge for WSN security.

Abstract

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology
and day by day it is attracting the attention of researchers
with its challenging characteristics and diversiﬁed applica-
tion domain. The more researchers try to develop further
cost and energy efﬁcient computing devices and algorithms
for WSN, the more challenging it becomes to ﬁt the security
of WSN into that constrained environment. However, secu-
rity is crucial to the success of applying WSN. So, familiarity
with the security aspects of WSN is essential before design-
ing WSN system. This paper studies the security problems of
WSN based on its resource restricted design and deployment
characteristics and the security requirements for designing
a secure WSN. Also, this study documents the well known
attacks at the different layers of WSN and some counter mea-
sures against those attacks. Finally, this paper discusses on
some defensive measures of WSN giving focus on the key
management, link layer and routing security.

Introduction

With the advances in wireless communication and comput-
ing devices, Wireless Sensor Network has come into the
spotlight. By utilizing these advances, WSN provides low
cost solution to a variety of real world challenges. A Wire-
less Sensor Network is a combination of wireless network-
ing and embedded system technology that monitors physi-
cal or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound,
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different loca-
tions. Initially, Wireless Sensor Networks were mainly used
for military surveillance. However, now its applicability is
extended to civilian and commercial application areas, in-
cluding environmental and medical monitoring, manufactur-
ing machinery performance monitoring, home automation,
trafﬁc control etc.

Security is a common concern for any network system, but
security in Wireless Sensor Network is of great importance
to ensure its application success. For example, when sensor
network is used for military purpose, it is very important to
keep the sensed information conﬁdential and authentic. Pro-
viding security for WSN represents a rich ﬁeld of research
problems as many existing security schemes for traditional
networks are not applicable for WSN. For example, WSN
requires lightweight security mechanisms so that the over-
head caused by security purpose are minimized and cannot
affect the performance of the network. This is because that

WSN is limited in resources and networks than traditional
networks. Also, deployment nature of WSN is different than
usual networks. Typically, a sensor network consists of a
large number of tiny sensor nodes and possibly a few power-
ful control nodes called base stations. Sensor nodes are sup-
plied with limited battery power and they have small mem-
ory size and limited computational ability. A typical sensor
node processor is of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM and
128KB ﬂash [24]. Again, WSN is supported with low com-
munication bandwidth. Very often, sensor nodes are scat-
tered randomly in the inaccessible, hazardous environment
without any infrastructure support and operate unattended.
These characteristics of WSN make it vulnerable to lots of
security problems and complicate the development of secu-
rity mechanisms as well. Moreover, the unreliable communi-
cation channel makes the security defenses even harder. All
these security challenges are encouraging new researches to
properly address sensor network security from the start and
develop security protocols and algorithms suitable for WSN.
The design limitations, communication and deployment
patterns of WSN pose several security problems to it and
make it vulnerable to different type attacks. Exploiting those
security holes adversaries can perform different types of at-
tacks in order to disrupt the network, hamper or misguide the
communication ﬂow of the network, or to intercept, fabricate
or modify the conﬁdential data. To combat against those at-
tacks coming from different levels of WSN security vulner-
abilities, ﬁrstly, it is very important to know about the se-
curity requirements of WSN. Moreover, analysis of security
requirements gives right directions to develop or implement
the proper safeguards against the security violations.

For fulﬁlling the basic security requirements of WSN and
defending some potential attacks, the defensive measures
discussed in this paper are categorized into cryptography,
key distribution for supporting cryptographic security fea-
tures, link layer security and secure routing. Deﬁning these
defensive measures for WSN with limited resource and net-
work facilities is an open research and there has been a sig-
niﬁcant number of research works regarding this issue.

The rest of the sections of this paper explore the issues
concerning the security of WSN one by one. The organiza-
tion of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses about
the security problems that arise in WSN because of its re-
source restrictions and deployment characteristics, Section
3 focuses on the essential requirements for ensuring WSN
security, Section 4 brieﬂy describes some attacks at differ-
ent layers and some proposed countermeasures and Section
5 discusses about the defensive measures of WSN directing
three important security aspects which are cryptography and

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

key management, link layer and routing security with some
related works in some detail.

Section 4 describes how an adversary can perform actual at-
tacks on WSN exploiting these security threats.

2 Security Problems

Usually, sensor nodes are densely deployed and they inter-
act with their surrounding environment very closely. They
are operated unattended and also without the absence of any
remote monitoring system. That is, the nodes are exposed
to the hostile environment as well as to the attackers and
at a risk of physically being tampered. So, there is always
the possibility of capturing nodes physically by the attack-
ers to attack the WSN. Also, there are lots of security prob-
lems in Wireless Sensor Network that can be logically ex-
ploited by the adversaries to attack the networks. According
to [5][17][24] [1]the security problems in WSN as follows.
Sensor nodes themselves are points of attack for the Wire-
less Sensor Networks. Adversaries can compromise or sub-
vert sensor nodes to gain full control of them and utilize them
for disrupting the network. If sensor nodes are compromised,
the attackers are able to know all the conﬁdential information
stored on them and may launch a variety of malicious ac-
tions against the network through these compromised nodes.
For example, the compromised nodes may discard important
data or report with wrong or modiﬁed data to mislead any
decision which is taken based on this data. The subverted
nodes may reveal the cryptographic key information and thus
allow the attackers to compromise the whole network. False
malicious nodes can be added to exhaust other sensor nodes,
attract them to send data only to it preventing the passage of
true data.

Besides the sensor nodes, attackers can target the rout-
ing information which is used to maintain the communica-
tion between sensor nodes and the base station. The routing
mechanisms used for WSN requires complete trust between
all the participating nodes. The proper transport of data in the
network depends on the integrity of the routing information
given by other nodes. False routing information transmit-
ted by a host may partition the network by misguiding the
trafﬁc to a small group of nodes and thus causes difﬁculty
in communication. As WSN requires hop by hop routing
to transport the packets to the destination, any intermediate
node acting maliciously can drop, modify or misguide the
trafﬁc traversing through it. Adversaries can create these se-
curity problems in WSN by compromising nodes, or spoof-
ing, altering, replaying the routing information.

Again, the unreliable wireless medium used as commu-
nication medium in WSN causes many security problems.
The adversary just needs to be within the radio range of the
nodes. Being there, he can easily intercept the transmission
without causing any interruption in the network communica-
tion. Thus, an adversary can collect sensitive information if
the transmission is not encrypted. Also, an attacker can eas-
ily inject malicious messages in the WSN. Moreover, by ana-
lyzing the trafﬁc, an adversary can gather useful information
to perform mischievous operations. However, for avoiding
collision and providing cooperation among the nodes during
the transmission, WSN uses medium access control proto-
cols. But, a subverted node can change the behavior of this
protocol in order to launch denial of service type attacks.

3 Security Requirements

Wireless Sensor Network is vulnerable to various attacks
like any other conventional network, but its limited resource
characteristics and unique application features requires some
extra security requirements including the typical network re-
quirements. [10] [15] [23] discuss on several security prop-
erties that should be achieved when designing a secure WSN.

3.1 Data Conﬁdentiality

Data conﬁdentiality is one of the vital security requirements
for WSN because of its application purpose (for example,
military and key distribution applications). Sensor nodes
communicate sensitive data, so it is necessary to ensure that
any intruder or other neighboring network could not get con-
ﬁdential information intercepting the transmissions. One
standard security method of providing data conﬁdentiality is
to encrypt data and use of shared key so that only intended
receivers can get the sensitive data. Section 5 discusses more
on this cryptography issues for WSN.

3.2 Authenticity and integrity

Only providing data conﬁdentiality is not enough to ensure
the data security in WSN. As an adversary can change mes-
sages on communication or inject malicious message, au-
thentication of data as well as sender are also crucial security
requirements. Source authentication provides the truthful-
ness of originality of the sender. Whereas, data authentica-
tion ensures the receiver that the data has not been modiﬁed
during the transmission.

3.3 Availability

We can not ignore the importance of availability of nodes
when they are needed. For example, when WSN is used for
monitoring purpose in manufacturing system, unavailability
of nodes may fail to detect possible accidents. Availability
ensures that sensor nodes are active in the network to fulﬁll
the functionality of the network. It should be ensured that
security mechanisms imposed for data conﬁdentiality and
authentication are allowing the authorized nodes to partici-
pate in the processing of data or communication when their
services are needed. As sensor nodes have limited battery
power, unnecessary computations may exhaust them before
their normal lifetime and make them unavailable. Some-
times, deployed security protocols or mechanisms in WSN
are exploited by the adversaries to exhaust the sensor nodes
by its resources and makes them unavailable for the network.
So, security policies should be implied so that sensor nodes
do not do extra computation or do not try to allocate extra
resources for security purpose.

3.4 Requirements for Secure Sensor Network

Protocols

The above mentioned security requirements are the basic se-
curity needs for WSN. However, sensor nodes are always at a
risk of physically being captured. Only fulﬁlling those basic
requirements can not totally solve the security problems cre-
ated by node compromise. Tamper resistance hardware can
protect the data stored on sensor node. But using such hard-
ware exceeds the cost limit of WSN by increasing cost of in-
dividual sensor node. So, a better solution is to design secure
sensor network protocols that are resilient to node comprise
or node failure. Secure protocols can also be developed to
achieve the basic security requirements.

Security protocols for WSN should have the capability of
providing the following requirements besides the basic secu-
rity requirements to ensure proper security functionality in
WSN.

• Data Freshness

Data Freshness implies that the data is recent. This is an
important security requirement to ensure that no mes-
sage has been replayed meaning that the messages are
in an ordering and they cannot be reused. This prevents
the adversaries from confusing the network by replay-
ing the captured messages exchanged between sensor
nodes. To achieve freshness, security protocols must be
designed in such a way that they can identify duplicate
packets and discard them preventing replay attack.

• Robustness against Attacks

Security protocols should have robustness against at-
tacks. If an attack is performed they should have the
ability to minimize the impact. They also should have
the ability to detect failed sensor nodes and work with
the remaining nodes and updated topology.

• Resilience

In practice, detection of compromised nodes and revo-
cation of their cryptographic keys are not always pos-
sible. So, a security protocol should always consider
WSN with compromised nodes. If a number of nodes
are compromised, secure protocols should function in
such a way that the performance of WSN degrades
gracefully.

• Broadcast Authentication

The base station broadcasts command and data to sen-
sor nodes. An attacker can modify or forge the com-
mands and sensor nodes perform incorrect operations
accepting those commands. So, secure protocols should
provide broadcast authentication functionality for the
sensor nodes.

• Self Organization

In WSN, there is no ﬁxed network infrastructure as
WSN is typically an ad hoc network. So, the sensor
nodes must have the self organizing and self healing ca-
pability to support multi hop routing. But, secure com-
munication among the sensor nodes is a precondition
for providing security in WSN. So, security protocols

should support efﬁcient key management so that sensor
nodes self organize themselves according to the key dis-
tribution and can build trust relations with the neighbor
nodes and secure virtual infrastructure as well.

• Scalability

The number of sensor nodes in WSN can be of sev-
eral orders of magnitudes and the nodes are densely de-
ployed. Again, the network topology of WSN is dy-
namic in nature that is new nodes can be added extend-
ing the network size. So, scalability is an important is-
sue and security protocols as well as key management
should cope with the increasing network size. A secu-
rity mechanism is not an efﬁcient one if it performs well
in a small size network but does not work well for large
size network.

4 Attacks in Wireless Sensor Network

For securing the Wireless Sensor Networks, it is necessary
to address the attacks and then take counter measures at the
design time of WSN. This section lists and gives brief dis-
cussion about the major attacks against Wireless Sensor Net-
work.

4.1 Physical Attack

This attack is also known as node capture. In this type of
attack, attackers gain full control over some sensor nodes
through direct physical access [3]. As the cost of sensor
nodes must be kept as cheap as possible for WSN, sensor
nodes with tamper prooﬁng features are impractical. This is
why sensor nodes are susceptible to be physically being ac-
cessed. Physical attacks have signiﬁcant impacts on routing
and access control mechanisms of WSN. For example, get-
ting key information stored on sensor node’s memory gives
attacker the opportunity of unrestricted access to WSN.

For performing physical attack an adversary may require
expert knowledge, costly equipments and other resources.
Also, most of the time physical attack requires the victim
node to be removed from the deployment area for a certain
amount of time. The neighbor nodes can notice this removal.
Still, some attacks can be performed without disrupting the
normal node operations or without being noticed by other
nodes. For example, an attacker can get control over the mi-
crocontroller of sensor node via JTAG or can gain the right
of reading or writing the microcontroller’s memory without
affecting the current program stored in the microcontroller
via Bootstrap Loader [3].Disabling the JTAG interface or
protecting the Bootstrap Loader password can protest these
types of attacks. Designing sensor nodes with hardware plat-
form of up to date embedded system security can improve the
physical level security. Moreover, monitoring sensor nodes
for unusual length of inactivity period and revocation of sus-
picious node’s authentication token are necessary steps those
should be taken for securing WSN against Physical or node
capture attacks.

4.2 Attacks at Different Layer
Besides physical attack, adversaries perform a large number
of attacks remotely. These attacks take place affecting dif-
ferent networking layers of WSN. This subsection describes
some of these well known attacks.

4.2.1 Physical Layer

Physical layer is responsible for actual data transmission
and reception, frequency selection, carrier frequency genera-
tion, signaling function and data encryption. This layer also
addresses the transmission media among the communicat-
ing nodes. WSN uses shared and radio based transmission
medium which makes it susceptible to jamming or radio in-
terference.

• Jamming

In physical layer, jamming is a common attack that can
be easily done by adversaries by only knowing the wire-
less transmission frequency used in the WSN. [10] Says
the attacker transmits radio signal randomly with the
same frequency as the sensor nodes are sending sig-
nals for communication. This radio signal interferes
with other signal sent by a sensor node and the receivers
within the range of the attacker cannot receive any mes-
sage. Thus, affected nodes become completely isolated
as long as the jamming signal continues and no mes-
sages can be exchanged between the affected nodes and
other sender nodes.
For preventing physical layer jamming [16] suggests
frequency hopping as a countermeasure. In frequency
hopping spread spectrum, nodes change frequency in
a predetermined sequence. But, it is not suitable for
WSN because every extra frequency requires extra pro-
cessing and the range of possible frequencies for WSN
is limited. [5] suggests Ultra Wide Band transmission
technique as an anti jamming solution. UWB transmis-
sion is based on sending very short pulses in order of
nanoseconds across a wide frequency band and is very
difﬁcult to detect. This technique is suitable for WSN
because of its low energy consumption.

4.2.2 Link Layer

The data link layer is responsible for the multiplexing of data
streams, data frame detection, medium access and error con-
trol. This layer is vulnerable to data collision when more
than one sender tries to send data on a single transmission
channel.

• DoS Attack by Collision Generation

In link year, collision is generated to exhaust the sen-
sor node’s energy.
In order to generate collision, the
attacker listens to the transmissions in WSN. When he
ﬁnds out the starting of a message, he sends his own ra-
dio signal for a small amount of time to interfere with
the message [5] which causes CRC error at the receiv-
ing end. Because of this attack, the receivers can not
receive the message correctly. Collision is more en-
ergy saving from the adversary part than radio jamming

as according to the literature, collision in one byte is
enough to cripple the message. So, we can say collision
is energy efﬁcient jamming. Sometimes, collision ad-
versely exploits the used MAC layer protocol in WSN.
Reception of incorrect message causes the sender node
to retransmit the message. Thus, attackers are able to
spoil the limited power of sender node by compelling
the node to retransmit message continuously.
Using error correcting codes is a typical way to defend
against collision. But, error correcting codes can work
up to a threshold level of collision for example, collision
caused by environmental or probabilistic errors. How-
ever, error correcting codes add processing and commu-
nication overhead. So, they are not effective for WSN.
Encrypting the packets at link layer may help to pre-
vent the jamming actions based on the content of the
packets. TinySec is a link layer security architecture
that provides the facility of link layer packet encryp-
tion. Section 5 describes the functionality of TinySec in
more details. Even when the packets are encrypted, the
temporal arrangement of packets induced by the nature
of the protocol may reveal the pattern and the adver-
sary can take advantage of it for jamming [16]. Also,
[16]suggests that in the absence of effective counter-
measure TDM like protocol LMAC can be adopted as
it has better anti jamming property than other protocols
like SMAC and BMAC. In LMAC, each node is given
only one time slot for collision free transmission. The
slots are divided among the nodes according to a dis-
tributed algorithm.

4.2.3 Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing messages from one
to another node which are neighbors or may be multi hops
away for example, node to base station or node to cluster
leader. The network layer for WSN is usually designed con-
sidering the power efﬁciency and data centric characteristics
of WSN. There are several attacks exploiting routing mech-
anisms in WSN. Some familiar attacks are listed here.

• Selective Forwarding

Selective forwarding is an attack where compromised
or malicious node just drops packets of its interest and
selectively forwards packets to minimize the suspicion
to the neighbor nodes. The impact becomes worse when
these malicious nodes are at closer to the base station
[24]. Then many sensor nodes route messages through
these malicious nodes. As a consequence of this attack,
a WSN may give wrong observation about the environ-
ment which affects badly the purpose of mission criti-
cal applications such as, military surveillance and forest
ﬁre monitoring. This attack can be extended to forward
messages to wrong nodes and thus misdirecting the traf-
ﬁc.
Two different countermeasures have been proposed
against selective forwarding attack. One defense is
to send data using multi path routing [8]. Another
one is detection of compromised nodes which are mis-
behaving in terms of selective forwarding and route

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the data seeking an alternative path.
[27]proposes
CHEMAS (CHEckpoint-based Multi-hop Acknowl-
edgement Scheme), a lightweight security scheme for
detecting selective forwarding attacks. This scheme
randomly selects a number of intermediate nodes as
checkpoints which are responsible for generating ac-
knowledgement. According to this scheme, along a
forwarding path,
if a checkpoint node does not re-
ceive enough acknowledgements from the downstream
checkpoint nodes it can detect abnormal packet loss and
identify suspect nodes.

• Sinkhole Attack

In sinkhole attack, a compromised node attracts a large
number of trafﬁc of surrounding neighbors by spooﬁng
or replaying an advertisement of high quality route to
the base station [17]. The attacker can do any malicious
activity with the packets passing through the compro-
mised node.

• Wormhole Attack

Wormhole is a critical attack, where the attacker re-
ceives packets at one point in the network, tunnels them
through a less latency link than the network links to an-
other point in the network and replay packets there lo-
cally [13]. This convinces the neighbor nodes of these
two end points that these two distant points at either
end of the tunnel are very close to each other. If one
end point of the tunnel is at near to the base station, the
wormhole tunnel can attract signiﬁcant amount of data
trafﬁc to disrupt the routing and operational functional-
ity of WSN. In this case, the attack is similar to sinkhole
as the adversary at the other side of the tunnel advertises
a better route to the base station.
Both the sinkhole and wormhole attacks are difﬁcult
to detect especially in WSNs those use routing proto-
cols in which routes are decided based on information
advertisements such as remaining energy or minimum
hop count to base station.
[16] suggests to use ge-
ographic routing protocol which has better resilience
against these attacks. GPSR [12] and GEAR [25] are
such geographic based routing protocols. In geographic
routing protocol, the trafﬁc is always directed to the
base station along a geographically shortest path. These
protocols do not rely on adversaries’ advertisement and
is able to ﬁnd out the actual location of adversary nodes.
[26] proposes a secure routing protocol named SERWA
that ﬁghts against wormhole attacks. This protocol can
detect wormhole attack without using any special hard-
ware and can provide a real secure route against the
wormhole attack.
• Hello Flood Attack

In Hello ﬂood attack, the attacker broadcasts hello mes-
sage with a very powerful radio transmission to the net-
work to convince all nodes to choose the attacker to
route their messages. The affected nodes waste their
energy by sending messages to the node which is out of
their radio range.

The key solution against Hello Flood attack is authen-
tication. Authenticated broadcast protocols for exam-
ple, µTESLA is an efﬁcient one for this purpose. This
protocol is based on symmetric key cryptography with
minimum packet overheads. Section 5 gives further de-
scription on µTESLA. [14] proposed a countermeasure
against Hello Flood attack adopting a probabilistic se-
cret sharing protocol and using bidirectional veriﬁca-
tion. Here, according to the probabilistic secret shar-
ing, secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not ex-
posed to any other nodes. For defending against attack,
each request (REQ) message forwarded by a node is
encrypted with a key which is generated on the ﬂy (dur-
ing communication). Sender node’s reachable neigh-
bors can decrypt and verify the REQ message but the at-
tacker will be prevented from launching the attack with-
out knowing that key.

• Sybil Attack

In Sybil attack, a malicious or subverted node forges the
identities of more than one node or fabricates identity.
This attack has signiﬁcant effect in geographic routing
protocols [17]. In the location based routing protocols,
nodes need to exchange location information with their
neighbors to route the geographically addressed packets
efﬁciently. Sybil attack disrupts this protocol function-
ality simultaneously being at more than one place.
Identity veriﬁcation is the key requirement for counter-
ing against Sybil attack. Unlike traditional networks,
veriﬁcation of identity in WSN cannot be done with a
single shared symmetric key and public key algorithm
because of computational limitation of WSN. Newsome
et al. in [19]shows with quantitative analysis that ran-
dom key pre distribution scheme can be used to defend
against Sybil attack. For this purpose, they associated
sensor node’s identity with its assigned key using one
way hash function. According to their mechanism, the
network is able to verify part or all of the keys that an
identity claims to have and thus counters against Sybil
attack.

4.2.4 Transport Layer

In network layer end to end connections are managed.

• Flooding Attack

According to [26] and [22], at this layer, adversaries
exploit the protocols that maintain state at either end
of the connection. For example, adversary sends many
connection establishment requests to the victim node to
exhaust its resources causing the Flooding attack.
One solution against this attack is to limit the number of
connections that a node can make. But, this can prevent
legitimate nodes to connect to the victim node. Another
solution is based on the client puzzles idea described
in [2]. According to this idea, if a node wants to con-
nect with other node, it at ﬁrst must solve a puzzle. An
attacker does not likely have inﬁnite resources and it is
not possible for him to make connections fast enough to
exhaust a serving node. Though solving puzzle includes

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

processing overhead, it is more desirable than excessive
communication.

• desynchronization attack

In desynchronization attack, an attacker repeatedly
forges messages to one or both end points of an active
connection with fake sequence number or control ﬂag.
Thus attackers desynchronize the end points so that sen-
sor nodes retransmit messages and waste their energy.
One countermeasure against this attack is to authenti-
cate all the packets exchanged between sensor nodes
along with all the control ﬁelds in transport header. The
adversary cannot spoof the packets and header and thus
this attack can be prevented.

4.2.5 Application Layer

In application layer, data is collected and manages. Here,
sensor nodes can be subverted to reveal its information in-
cluding disclosure of cryptographic keys hence compromis-
ing the whole sensor network. Moreover, a node can be com-
promised to malfunction and generate inaccurate data and
this effect can be worse enough when the node is a cluster
leader in WSN [24].

If a node is compromised, detection and exclusion of that
node from the sensor network is a probable solution. LEAP
[28] can verify whether a node has been compromised or not
and can revoke compromised nodes with efﬁcient re keying
mechanism.

5 WSN Defenses and Related Works

It is very hard to accumulate all the security requirements in
a single security mechanism as the WSN has severe resource
constraints and it has no predeﬁned infrastructure. Lots of re-
search have been done and are on going to privilege the WSN
with crucial security support. WSN needs effective, energy
and resource efﬁcient key management scheme for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality, integrity and authentication security ser-
vices. Link layer security mechanism in WSN can provide
important security support by guaranteeing integrity, authen-
ticity, and conﬁdentiality of messages because they deny an
outsider access to the network. Secure routing is another es-
sential requirement for protecting WSN against external and
insider attack. Proper security solution for preventing DoS
attacks at different layers is also a dire need for protecting
the WSN from disruption. This section discusses on cryp-
tography and key establishment for WSN and then some se-
curity mechanisms regarding link layer and routing security
of WSN are explored in some detail.

5.1 Cryptography
Cryptography is essential for ensuring security services.
Public key cryptography such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agree-
ment protocol or RSA signature is not suitable for WSN be-
cause of its limitation in memory, computation and power.
For example, to perform a single security operation RSA ex-
ecutes thousands or even millions of multiplication instruc-
tions. In wireless devices with limited facilities, for encryp-

tion and decryption RSA requires on the order of tens of sec-
onds and up to minutes [4]. Whereas, symmetric cryptogra-
phy and hash functions are faster and more computationally
efﬁcient than public key algorithms. That is why, most secu-
rity schemes and security researches for WSN are based on
symmetric key cryptography.

5.2 Key Distribution / Management
One major problem of symmetric cryptography is how to dis-
tribute shared key to communicating nodes. Another prob-
lem is to keep shared key secret only between the communi-
cating hosts so that adversary’s can not get reach of it. This
is why, besides light weight cipher, efﬁcient key distribution
and key management are fundamental security requirements
for WSN. Self organization is an important aspect of WSN
as the sensor nodes are deployed without following any pre
established structure. For example, some times sensor nodes
are just airdropped in enemies’ arena. In such situations, sen-
sor nodes organize themselves to form a wireless network.
Key pre-distribution is a key management scheme where be-
fore deployment each sensor node is provided with some
keys and after reaching the target position the sensor nodes
builds up a secure network among them based on those keys.
Another important aspect of WSN is in network processing
as it provides energy efﬁciency to WSN. In this case, WSN
is divided into number of clusters, data is collected and pro-
cessed by an aggregator node of each cluster and then trans-
mitted to another aggregator forming a hierarchy and this
data fusion saves energy of WSN. Here passive participation
is another aspect, in which sensor nodes take actions based
on messages from other nodes. In such cases, hierarchical
key management is required to provide security in different
level of communication in WSN. The following discussion is
on some works based on these two types of key management
protocol.

5.2.1 Key Pre-distribution Key Management

Eschenauer and Gligor in [7] introduced a random key pre-
distribution scheme where the key distribution is divided into
three phases which are key pre-distribution, shared-key dis-
covery, and path-key establishment. In key pre-distribution
stage, a large pool of S keys and associated identiﬁers for
each key are generated. Then from that key pool a num-
ber of key rings are generated by randomly drawing k keys
along with their identiﬁers for each key ring and then each
sensor node is given a key ring. The base station stores the
key rings of each node and the associated node identiﬁers.
Also, each sensor node shares a pair wise key with the base
station. In shared key discovery phase, after the deployment,
each node broadcasts a list α, EKi(α) ; i= 1,. . . ,k where α
is a challenge.
In the communication range of the broad-
casting node if a receiving node can decrypt EKi(α) with
the proper key from its key chain then the broadcasting node
and that receiver node establish a secure link between them
with that shared key. If two sensor nodes which do not share
a common key but want to communicate and are at two or
more links away, then they can get a path-key in path estab-
lishment phase. If a node is compromised, the base station
sends a message containing the identiﬁer list of the keys of

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

the compromised node’s key chain to all the nodes encrypt-
ing with the pair wise keys shared with them. The nodes in
the network can then delete the corresponding key from their
key chain. This scheme is also known as basic scheme.

In this key management scheme if the size of the network
grows, each node in the network needs to store only a few
keys, which is memory efﬁcient and provides scalability.
Again, when a node is compromised, the probability of an
attacker to successfully attack a node is k/S where k«S. So,
in key revocation process much communication overhead is
not introduced as a small number of nodes are affected. But,
this scheme is not able to provide node to node authentica-
tion which is a requirement to protect node replication attack
(i.e, sybil attack).

Chan et al. in [6] proposed Q-Composite Scheme, which
was introduced to increase the resilience of the network
against node capture than basic scheme. Here in this scheme,
in shared key discovery phase, to establish a secure link two
nodes require at least q common keys in their key rings in-
stead of a single common key as in basic scheme. Accord-
ing to the authors’ observation this property increases the
resilience to node capture when a small number of nodes are
compromised. However, this scheme performs badly when
more nodes are compromised as same keys are used repeat-
edly in a network. But, usually adversaries ﬁrst try to attack
in small scale and if they succeed then they proceed for large
scale attack. So, this scheme is reasonable to protect small
scale attack and thus preventing large scale one. This scheme
also cannot provide node to node authentication and if an at-
tacker performs large scale attack the security of the network
breaks down under this scheme.

Chan et al. in [6] also proposed a multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme for WSN where security is more important than
bandwidth or power drain. The problem in basic scheme is
that the common key which establishes a security link be-
tween two nodes A and B, may reside in the memory of other
nodes in the network and by capturing those nodes an adver-
sary can attack that secure link between A and B. So, Chan et
al. introduced a key update phase in multipath keyreinforce-
ment scheme.
In this case, A generates random j random
values (v1, v2,. . . ,vj) where j is the number of disjoint paths
available from A to B. Then A sends each random value
along a different disjoint path. After receiving all the ran-
dom values, B generates a new key by doing XOR the origi-
nal key with all the random values. If an adversary wants to
reconstruct the communication key he needs to eavesdrop all
the j disjoint paths. The disadvantage of this scheme is that
it introduces communication overhead which may exhaust
nodes battery life and may give chance adversaries to launch
DOS attack. Chan et al. further extended their research by
proposing random pairwise key scheme to provide node to
node authentication.

5.2.2 Hierarchical Key Management

Zhu et al. [28] proposed Localized Encryption and Authen-
tication Protocol (LEAP) for WSN which is a key manage-
ment protocol. LEAP provides different security require-
ments for different types of messages exchanged between
sensor nodes. For this purpose, LEAP introduces 4 types of

keys for each sensor node which are individual key, pairwise
shared key, group key and cluster key.

Each sensor node has a unique key named individual key
which is shared with the base station to secure the messages
between a sensor node and the base station. Example of such
messages are alert message of abnormal observation about
neighboring node from a sensor node to base station, key-
ing material or special instruction for a node from the base
station and so on.

Pairwise shared key is a unique key which is shared be-
tween each node and its neighboring node. This key pro-
vides security when a node wants to share cluster key with
its neighbor or a node sends data to the aggregator node. This
key is also used to provide efﬁcient node to node authentica-
tion.

Group key is shared among all the nodes in the network
and the base station uses this key to provide security of
broadcast message sent to the whole group. For example, the
base station encrypts the missions, queries and interests with
this key and broadcasts the encrypted message. As this key is
shared among all the nodes, there is a chance that an adver-
sary can get the key by compromising a node. So, LEAP also
provides efﬁcient rekeying mechanism for updating group
key to solve this problem.

Cluster key is a key shared by a node and all its neigh-
bors. This key secures locally broadcast message and sup-
ports in network processing and passive participation. For
example, when a node locally broadcast the sensor message
by securing with this key, the neighbor nodes can take deci-
sion whether to send the same message or not by decrypting
or authenticating that message.

LEAP can minimize the effect of selective forwarding at-
tack as it uses local broadcast, thereby the effect of this at-
tack cannot be transferred more than 2 hops away. LEAP
can prevent HELLO Flood attack as the node accepts packets
only from its authenticated neighbor. LEAP can also prevent
Sybil attack by providing unique ID authentication for each
node. Again, after key establishment as each node has the
knowledge about its neighbors, it is not easy for and adviser
to convince a node that it is near to a particular compromised
node, thereby Worm Whole attack is discouraged. The dis-
advantage of this scheme is that memory for each node to
store 4 types of keys as well as computation and communi-
cation overhead increase if the density of WSN increases.

5.3 Link Layer Security
TinySec [11] works at link layer and provides access con-
trol, message authencity, integrity and message conﬁdential-
ity. TinySec provides message security using cryptographic
primitives- encryption and MAC. TinySec supports two dif-
ferent security options: authenticated encryption (TinySec-
AE) and authentication only (TinySec-Auth).
In TinySec-
AE, TinySec encrypts the data payload and authenticates the
packet with a MAC. With TinySec-Auth, the packet authenti-
cation is performed with a MAC without encrypting the data
payload.

For encryption, TinySec uses an 8 byte IV and cipher
block chaining (CBC). One problem here is that if IV re-
peats it can introduce security leakage. This is why CBC

TKK T-110.5190 Seminar on Internetworking

2009-04-27

mode is used here as with the same IV under CBC mode the
cipher text will leak only the length (in blocks) of the longest
shared preﬁx of the two plaintexts. For providing message
integrity, TinySec uses a cipher block chaining construction,
CBC-MAC with 4 byte output for computing and verifying
MACs. With a 4 byte MAC if an adversary tries to inject
a malicious packet into the network, he will succeed after
231 tries. Even If an adversary tries to do so, implementing
a simple mechanism that nodes will signal the base station
when the rate of MAC failures exceeds some predetermined
threshold can prevent such attempts. TinySec also provides
the ﬂexibility of using any keying mechanism. The draw-
back for implementing TinySec is that TinySec packets are
one to ﬁve bytes longer than normal WSN packets which
may reduce bandwidth and increase latency and energy con-
sumption.

5.4 Secure Routing

In conventional networks the routing protocols mainly con-
cern about the reliable delivery of messages. Message secu-
rity (i.e. conﬁdentiality, integration and authentication) and
protection against DOS attacks are performed by end to end
mechanisms such as SSL or SSH. As end to end communica-
tion is the main concern, there is no need for the intermediate
routers to know the content of the message except the nec-
essary headers. But, the scenario is different in WSN where
in many cases intermediate nodes need to communicate with
each other for providing in network processing or data ag-
gregation before sending the message to the base station. In
this case, intermediate nodes have the ability to modify, sup-
press or eavesdrop the message content and compromised
node can exploit the features of routing protocol to cause po-
tential damage of working functionality of the network. So,
for WSN, routing protocols must be designed taking security
also as a goal. For facilitating routing protocols with secu-
rity mechanisms key management for each sensor node is an
essential part which has been discussed in the previous text.
The following text is on some secure routing mechanisms for
WSN.

[9] proposed a routing protocol directed diffusion for
WSN which is energy, bandwidth and memory efﬁcient
highly desirable for WSN. But this protocol is not able to
afford secure group communication that is the communica-
tion between sink and sources. Pietro et al. in [21] extended
this directed diffusion protocol to incorporate security in it.
They extended the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) for facil-
itating secure multicast and merged this extension with di-
rected diffusion and named their scheme as LKHW. LKHW
gives robustness in communication and enforces both back-
ward and forward secrecy. But, it cannot provide data au-
thentication.

Nasser et al in [18] proposed SEER: Secure and Energy-
Efﬁcient multipath Routing protocol in which base station
performs the route discovery, maintenance and route selec-
tion. Instead of using a single path, base station periodically
select a new path from multipath based on current energy
level of nodes along each path. Attacks on routing protocols
that attract trafﬁc by advertising high quality route to the base
station such as, Wormhole and Sinkhole can be defended by

SEER as the routing path is selected by the base station. If in
the routing path a node is compromised, the attack lasts for
limited time as the base station periodically reselects new
path. SEER can also defend selective forwarding attack as
the attacker cannot include itself in the routing path to launch
the selective forwarding attack. Again if any compromised
node selectively drops packet it can be detected by the next
hop as SEER uses sequence number that uniquely identify
each packet. But, if adversaries can breach the security of
base station they can disrupt the whole network.

Perrig et al.

[20] present SPINS which comprises two
security building blocks optimized to use in WSN which
are SNEP and µTESLA. SNEP provides semantic security,
data authentication, replay protection and weak freshness by
implementing symmetric cryptographic primitives such as
MAC, and encryption with RC5. Before encrypting the mes-
sage sender attaches a random bit string with the message
and this property provides semantic security, replay protec-
tion and weak freshness. For excluding extra communication
overhead of sending this extra random bit with each message,
SNEP shares a counter between the communicating nodes
for the block cipher in counter mode (CTR). The communi-
cating parties increment the shared counter after each block.
Data authentication is achieved by verifying the MAC value
of the message.

µTESLA provides authenticated broadcast for WSN from
symmetric primitives, but introduces asymmetry with de-
layed key disclosure and one-way function key chains.
µTESLA uses a loosely synchronized timer on both the base
station and other nodes to authenticate the MAC key. The
base station computes a MAC on a packet with a key which
is secret at that certain time to send the packet as authenti-
cated. When a node receives a packet it can verify that the
base station has not yet disclosed the corresponding MAC
key. So, it stores the packet in its buffer until for the next key
disclosure of the base station. After having the disclosed key,
the node veriﬁes the correctness of the key and authenticates
the packet which it stored in buffer for authentication before
key disclosure. As µTESLA incorporates the mechanism to
verify the MAC key of base station by sensor nodes, sensor
nodes are assured that no adversary could alter the packet
in transit. But, the broadcast here is limited to the base sta-
tion. If any node wants to broadcast it has to do that via base
station.

6 Conclusion

With super small sensor nodes, super low power consump-
tion and alluring low cost, Wireless Sensor Network is at-
tracting uncountable application domains to sense and col-
lect data. But, these attractive features made Wireless Sensor
Network challenging to integrate security mechanism into it.
This paper gives an idea of a major subset of security prob-
lems that Wireless Sensor Network faces because of its ex-
ceptional design characteristics, communication and deploy-
ment pattern. At the same time, this paper includes brief dis-
cussion on the important security aspects that are required to
design a secure Wire Sensor Network. Some Well known

adversaries can actually attack the WSN exploiting its vul-
nerabilities and what kind of security awareness should be
taken into account when incorporating security mechanisms
in WSN. Finally, this paper explores some works on three
crucial security aspects of WSN which are key management,
link layer security and secure routing. There are also many
security aspects of WSN such as secure data aggregation,
intrusion detection, secure localization, etc. which are not
covered in this paper.

There are many security solutions or mechanisms that
have been proposed for Wireless Sensor Network; some of
which are concerned about speciﬁc security attacks whereas
some are concerned about speciﬁc security aspect. There
is no standard security mechanism that can provide overall
security for WSN. Providing such mechanism is not possi-
ble also as WSNs are implemented in various application
domains with different level of security requirements. De-
signing a secure WSN needs proper mapping of security so-
lutions or mechanisms with different security aspects. This
also imposes a research challenge for WSN security.
