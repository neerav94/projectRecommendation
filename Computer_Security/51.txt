ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID

equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to:

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to

specific attributes or characteristics,

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID

equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to: 

• 

 

• 

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to 
field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 

•  query the data base for information on identification/location of grain with 

specific attributes or characteristics, 
link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  databases  for  identifying  other 
attribute information associated with the grain, and 

2

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to

specific attributes or characteristics,

attribute information associated with the grain, and

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID

Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID”

Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna.

contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the

specific attributes or characteristics,

attribute information associated with the grain, and

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID 
Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer.  After  sufficient  energy  has  been  received  and 
stored,  the  remainder  of  the  circuit  becomes  active.  The  density  of  the 
Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID” 
command from the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer device, the State 
Machine reads the tag’s identification number (ID) from the non-volatile 
Read-only  memory  and  sends  this  ID  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking 
Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine reads the tag’s ID from the Read-only Memory, appends all data 
in the non-volatile Read-write Memory to the ID, and sends the composite 
message  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer  via  the  RF 
Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “write  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine writes the received bits into the non-volatile Read-write Memory. 
The  capacity  of  the  non-volatile  Read-only  Memory  is  sufficient  to 
contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

• 

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to: 

• 

 

• 

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to 
field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 

•  query the data base for information on identification/location of grain with 

specific attributes or characteristics, 
link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  databases  for  identifying  other 
attribute information associated with the grain, and 

2

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID 
Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer.  After  sufficient  energy  has  been  received  and 
stored,  the  remainder  of  the  circuit  becomes  active.  The  density  of  the 
Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID” 
command from the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer device, the State 
Machine reads the tag’s identification number (ID) from the non-volatile 
Read-only  memory  and  sends  this  ID  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking 
Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine reads the tag’s ID from the Read-only Memory, appends all data 
in the non-volatile Read-write Memory to the ID, and sends the composite 
message  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer  via  the  RF 
Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “write  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine writes the received bits into the non-volatile Read-write Memory. 
The  capacity  of  the  non-volatile  Read-only  Memory  is  sufficient  to 
contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

when a single tag needs to be dispensed. It consists of a disk connected to a rod. 
The  other  end  of  the  rod  is  inserted  into  a  solitron.  When  a  positive  current  is 
applied to the solitron, the rod is pulled in, thus the dispensing door disk opens the 
hole in the bottom of the tags tank and a single tag is released into the tags guide 
pipe. When a negative current is applied to the solitron, it pushes the rod out, thus 
closing the dispensing hole. Tags guide pipe allows directing the released tag to 
an appropriate location to be released into the grain stream.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to: 

• 

 

• 

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to 
field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 

•  query the data base for information on identification/location of grain with 

specific attributes or characteristics, 
link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  databases  for  identifying  other 
attribute information associated with the grain, and 

2

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID 
Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer.  After  sufficient  energy  has  been  received  and 
stored,  the  remainder  of  the  circuit  becomes  active.  The  density  of  the 
Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID” 
command from the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer device, the State 
Machine reads the tag’s identification number (ID) from the non-volatile 
Read-only  memory  and  sends  this  ID  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking 
Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine reads the tag’s ID from the Read-only Memory, appends all data 
in the non-volatile Read-write Memory to the ID, and sends the composite 
message  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer  via  the  RF 
Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “write  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine writes the received bits into the non-volatile Read-write Memory. 
The  capacity  of  the  non-volatile  Read-only  Memory  is  sufficient  to 
contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

Figure 8 shows the RFID grain chip tag dispenser, reader/writer and the 
RFID tags and grain in free falling mode, similar to that which would be used in a 
combine  grain  bin.    Conceptually,  the  grain  tracking  tags  dispenser  consists  of 
tags  tank,  dispensing  door,  solitron,  tags  guide,  and  control  electronics  (Figure 
9a). The tags tank is filled in with RFID tags. The tags dispensing door will open 
when a single tag needs to be dispensed. It consists of a disk connected to a rod. 
The  other  end  of  the  rod  is  inserted  into  a  solitron.  When  a  positive  current  is 
applied to the solitron, the rod is pulled in, thus the dispensing door disk opens the 
hole in the bottom of the tags tank and a single tag is released into the tags guide 
pipe. When a negative current is applied to the solitron, it pushes the rod out, thus 
closing the dispensing hole. Tags guide pipe allows directing the released tag to 
an appropriate location to be released into the grain stream.

Tag dispenser can be used to dispense tags into a stream of grain moved 
by the belt-based grain handling system, into a stream of freely falling grain, and 
into  a  stream  of  grain  moved  by  an  auger.  In  the  belt-based  grain  handling 
systems, the dispenser is located above the belt and its tags guide pipe is directed 
towards the belt (Figure 9b). In the case of a freely falling grain, the dispenser is 
located next to the free fall volume and its tags guide pipe is directed towards the 
falling grain. In the case of an auger-based grain handling system, the dispenser 
tags guide pipe is directly inserted into the auger pipe or is positioned above the 
auger intake system.

This depiction presents the approach which could be used for removing the tags

truck or rail hopper. Conceptually, the magnetic grain tracking tags belt remover 
consists of a moving belt, permanent magnet located inside the belt, and a storage 
box  for  removed  tags  (Figure  11a).  The  permanent  magnet  pulls  up  metal-
cowered RFID tags. The tags are then moved by the tags removing belt to the tags 
storage  box.  Tags  storage  box  should  be  positioned  right  at  the  edge  of  the 
permanent magnet, thus allowing the captured tags to be immediately released to 
the storage box. The dimensions of remover, speed of the tags removing belt, and 
the power of the permanent magnet are defined by the deployment environment.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to: 

• 

 

• 

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to 
field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 

•  query the data base for information on identification/location of grain with 

specific attributes or characteristics, 
link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  databases  for  identifying  other 
attribute information associated with the grain, and 

2

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID 
Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer.  After  sufficient  energy  has  been  received  and 
stored,  the  remainder  of  the  circuit  becomes  active.  The  density  of  the 
Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID” 
command from the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer device, the State 
Machine reads the tag’s identification number (ID) from the non-volatile 
Read-only  memory  and  sends  this  ID  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking 
Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine reads the tag’s ID from the Read-only Memory, appends all data 
in the non-volatile Read-write Memory to the ID, and sends the composite 
message  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer  via  the  RF 
Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “write  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine writes the received bits into the non-volatile Read-write Memory. 
The  capacity  of  the  non-volatile  Read-only  Memory  is  sufficient  to 
contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

Tag Dispenser 

 

Figure 8 shows the RFID grain chip tag dispenser, reader/writer and the 
RFID tags and grain in free falling mode, similar to that which would be used in a 
combine  grain  bin.    Conceptually,  the  grain  tracking  tags  dispenser  consists  of 
tags  tank,  dispensing  door,  solitron,  tags  guide,  and  control  electronics  (Figure 
9a). The tags tank is filled in with RFID tags. The tags dispensing door will open 
when a single tag needs to be dispensed. It consists of a disk connected to a rod. 
The  other  end  of  the  rod  is  inserted  into  a  solitron.  When  a  positive  current  is 
applied to the solitron, the rod is pulled in, thus the dispensing door disk opens the 
hole in the bottom of the tags tank and a single tag is released into the tags guide 
pipe. When a negative current is applied to the solitron, it pushes the rod out, thus 
closing the dispensing hole. Tags guide pipe allows directing the released tag to 
an appropriate location to be released into the grain stream.

Tag dispenser can be used to dispense tags into a stream of grain moved 
by the belt-based grain handling system, into a stream of freely falling grain, and 
into  a  stream  of  grain  moved  by  an  auger.  In  the  belt-based  grain  handling 
systems, the dispenser is located above the belt and its tags guide pipe is directed 
towards the belt (Figure 9b). In the case of a freely falling grain, the dispenser is 
located next to the free fall volume and its tags guide pipe is directed towards the 
falling grain. In the case of an auger-based grain handling system, the dispenser 
tags guide pipe is directly inserted into the auger pipe or is positioned above the 
auger intake system. 
 

Tag Remover 

 

The  tag  remover  combined  with  the  reader/writer  is  show  in  Figure  10.  
This depiction presents the approach which could be used for removing the tags 
from free falling grain from an auger spout or grain flowing out the bottom of a 
truck or rail hopper. Conceptually, the magnetic grain tracking tags belt remover 
consists of a moving belt, permanent magnet located inside the belt, and a storage 
box  for  removed  tags  (Figure  11a).  The  permanent  magnet  pulls  up  metal-
cowered RFID tags. The tags are then moved by the tags removing belt to the tags 
storage  box.  Tags  storage  box  should  be  positioned  right  at  the  edge  of  the 
permanent magnet, thus allowing the captured tags to be immediately released to 
the storage box. The dimensions of remover, speed of the tags removing belt, and 
the power of the permanent magnet are defined by the deployment environment.

ABSTRACT 

In  this  paper  we  outline  a  system  for  tracking  grain  using  GPS  a  new 
RFID grain chip technology. The system will enable tagging the location of the 
grain  origination  within  individual  fields.  Attribute  information  including,  for 
example,  origination  of  variety  seed  stock,  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications, 
stress, disease or other quality attributes can then be linked to the individual batch 
loads  from  other  GIS  database  layers.  The  RFID  grain  chips  will  be  developed 
using existing passive microchip technology and encased in a durable container 
with the size, weight and texture characteristics of the grain being tracked, such as 
corn, soybeans, or wheat. At any tracking stage, we will have the ability to write 
and read data from the grain chip, insert new grain chips, and extract grain chips. 
The  purpose  of  the  system  stems  from  both  the  economic  and  food 
security value of physically tracking batch loads of grain and grain attributes from 
the  harvest  field  to  any  point  in  the  supply  chain.  Processors  will  be  able  to 
increase  operational  efficiency  and  value 
timely 
information  regarding  the  attributes  of  grain,  both  available  in  storage  and 
arriving at the processing facilities. End users and consumers are also willing to 
pay  more  for  products  which  include  documentation  of  the  origin  and  proof  of 
segregation from unwanted ingredients or attributes. Increased concerns regarding 
bio-terrorism  dictate  the  need  for  a  system  by  which  we  can  measure 
commingling and trace back through the transportation and production systems.

INTRODUCTION 

 

• 
• 

During a harvesting and production process for grain, the grain typically 
undergoes various grain handling stages. For example, a grain handling process 
may begin at a farm, where the grain is harvested and placed into a truck. The 
grain  may  be  taken  to  an  on-farm  storage  facility  for  storage,  handling,  and/or 
processing. Afterwards, the grain may be transported to long term storage, to a 
livestock facility site, or to an off-farm facility for processing. In later stages, the 
grain  may  be  transported  domestically  or  internationally  to  an  end  user  and/or 
may be further processed. At any or all of these stages, however, the possibility 
exists for commingling of the grain with other product or foreign matter, or for 
other  problems,  such  as  damage,  theft,  etc.  This  concern  has  increased 
significantly in recent times with greater awareness of food security issues. It thus 
is desirable to have an indication of the history of a particular grain. To date, this 
problem is mainly unsolved in the grain industry. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  conceptual  design  of  a  system  for  tracking 
agricultural  grain,  such  as  corn,  soybeans,  and  wheat,  from  harvest  to  the  final 
“whole” grain point in the supply chain process. The system includes: 
tracking units/chips that are deposited with the grain at harvest, 
the technology to systematically deposit the chips into the combine grain 
bin, 
the technology to clean the chips out of the grain at any point in the supply 
chain process, 
the hardware and software to write and read data to and from the chips at 
any point in the supply chain process and provide the relational database 
protocols, 
the handheld technology for the read/write functions, and 
the software data-base system which allows for storage and time/location 
based mining of the grain tracking history and attributes. 
A radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag is the main component of the 
proposed grain tracking system. The tag is dimensioned to approximate a size of 
an individual grain and multiple such tags are deposited in a container of the grain 
at  the  harvesting  stage.  At  each  grain  handling  stage  the  tags  are  programmed 
with the time and location of the event as well as any other attributes relevant to 
the grain handling process, e.g., serial number of equipment, etc. Therefore, the 
entire history of grain handling is stored in the tags and can be red at any time. 
New  tags  can  be  inserted  in  the  grain  or  removed  from  the  grain  at  any  grain 
processing stage, as needed.

• 

From the context of food security and economic value the system has the 

ability to: 

• 

 

• 

trace  back,  with  visualization  tools,  the  entire  transportation  path  of  the 
tracked grain from the end use/processor to storage, road transport back to 
field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 

•  query the data base for information on identification/location of grain with 

specific attributes or characteristics, 
link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  databases  for  identifying  other 
attribute information associated with the grain, and 

2

• 

identifying  alternative  sources  of  food  and  export  safe  grain  when 
potential contamination or agro-bio-terrorism events occur. 
In the remainder of the paper we outline how the proposed system can be 
used  in  practice  to  track  grain  movement  throughout  various  grain  handling 
stages.  We also describe various hardware and software components included in 
the system. 
 

GRAIN TRACKING APPLICATION OVERVIEW 

 

Consider  an  example  in  which  grain  is  moved  along  11  possible 
processing stages (Figure 1). Stage 1 is at the point of harvest and stage 11 is the 
last whole grain point in the supply chain process (grain processor or export). At 
any of these stages we will have the ability to: 1) insert new RFID tag, 2) write 
and  read  data  from  the  grain  chip,  and/or  3)  extract  grain  chips.  However,  we 
envision that in most cases the grain chips will be inserted at stage 1 and extracted 
at stage 11. Reading and writing the tags do not need to occur at all ten stages 
however. 

Beginning with stage 1 there will be detailed identity/tracking information 
written  to  each  RFID  tag.  Each  RFID  tag  will  have  its  own  unique  identity 
number (ID). The tags will be deposited in the combine grain bin during harvest 
at some rate (e.g., one per every fifty bushels of grain harvested). At the point of 
deposit the tags will, through an RFID read/write device linked to the combine 
yield monitor and GPS, be encoded with the current clock date/time, the current 
GPS  coordinates,  and  the  serial  number  of  the  combine.  At  stages  2  and  3 
(transfer to the grain cart and semi truck) the tags will again be programmed with 
additional information of the current time and GPS coordinates during the grain 
transfer process and with IDs of the grin cart, semi track, etc. In these first three 
stages the time and GPS coordinates will vary for each RFID tag. 

Stages 4 through 6 include the on-farm storage and handling portion of the 
system. The RFID tags will again be programmed with additional time and GPS 
coordinate and ID information at stage 4 when leaving the truck to enter the first 
grain holding bin. In this case the GPS coordinate will be a fixed location for the 
site with an ID number for each bin at the site. In some situations there will only 
be a stage 4 recording. In cases, such as wet corn the grain may be transferred to a 
dryer (stage 5) and then to the final holding bin (stage 6). In these cases the tags 
will  again  be  encoded  with  the  time  and  ID  at  transfer,  thereby  allow  later 
calculation of storage time in each bin and drying time. 

Stage 7 will be similar to stage 3, with the transfer time and serial number 
of  the  truck  and  site  GPS  coordinates  recorded.  From  that  point  the  grain  may 
move on to a stage 8a location, a rural elevator where there will be a processor 
encoding and reading similar to stage 4-6 while the grain is in storage and transfer 
within  the  fixed  site.  Alternatively,  grain  may  move  directly  to  a  stage  8b 
livestock facility site where there will again be recording of the time and location 
of arrival at the site and then extraction and reading the RFID tags. 

From stage 8a the grain will go through another stage 9 truck transfer and 
then  on  to  a  stage  10  terminal  or  processor  where  again  the  final  encoding, 
reading  and  extraction  will  occur  unless  the  grain  goes  on  to  stage  11  export 
where extraction can occur at the international processor.

Figure 2 shows an example of data recorded and retained on a single RFID 
tag through the first four event stages. At any given moment of time, the chips 
will  contain  complete  history  of  product  movement,  storage,  and  processing, 
including time and location of transaction and serial numbers or IDs of relevant 
equipment,  storage  facilities,  etc.  Additional  information,  such  as  rate  at  which 
RFID  tags  were  inserted,  moisture  content,  etc.,  can  be  stored  as  well.  In  the 
initial implementation, the tracking chips will be designed to store the following 
data at each deposit and transfer stage: 

•  unique hard coded tag ID 
•  sequential event number 
•  clock time associated with the event (deposit, transfer, read, etc.)

The software to facilitate the tracking, data queries and movement/location 

visualization will include the following: 

•  Stand-alone  software  for  recording  the  data  code  components  at  initial 

deposit, final extraction and each “write” phase of the system, 
linkage  to  external  GIS  and  non-spatial  databases  for  referencing  other 
attribute, time, and spatial data layers, 

•  visualization  tools  for  static  identification  of  the  grain  with  attribute 

• 

location information (in-storage) 

•  visualization  software  for  backtracking  grain  movement,  storage  and 

Figure  3  provides  an  example  of  how  visualization  software  might  be 
implemented to trace back the grain from processor to storage facility back to an 
individual location in a field.  An overlay of the unique RFID tag recording points 
can  be  shown  on  a  satellite  image  or  other  geographic  referenced  maps.  By 
highlighting  particular  locations  within  the  depicted  lots  (e.g.,  by  linking  the 
visualization with absolute coordinates) and highlighting the extracted coordinates 
in the display, individual points for a particular RFID tag can be shown on the 
display.  An  individual  tag  record  can  be  recalled  showing  the  unique  tag  id 
number, event number, atomic clock time of harvest, GPS coordinates, the serial 
number  of  the  combine  and  a  unique  lot  number.  Moreover,  a  complete  list  of 
RFID tags in storage can be displayed as shown at the processor level in the upper 
right image. The id numbers from the tags may then be linked to the database for 
displaying the compete history of the first to last stage events, time, location, etc. 
Such  backtracking  can  effectively  illustrate  movement  of  the  grain,  when  and 
where the grain was stored, and/or origination of the grain. Further, visualization 
software may be provided for identifying buffer/isolation regions, for example, in 
the field, storage, and/or transport routes for segregating high-value or potentially 
contaminated grain.

The  data  and  software  structure  will  virtually  eliminate  the  potential  to 
manipulate  or  falsify  the  coding  information.  By  coding  the  time,  location  and 
serial number of equipment used we have built in redundancy, which will allow

checking  for  errors  in  terms  of  the  time-line  of  chip  read/write  information, 
location/spatial  error  checks,  reference  to  appropriate  harvest,  transport  and 
storage  equipment,  and  time-line  reference  to  appropriate  batch  loads.  The 
visualization  software  will  enable  time  and  spatial  movement  of  grain  and 
depicting origination of any data outside the prescribed control parameters. 
 

RFID GRAIN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

The  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Tag  is  the  device  that  travels  with  the  grain 
being tracked. It has roughly the same size, shape and weight of the grain being 
tracked so that the tag remains with its host bushels of grain as the grain moves 
from  the  field  to  its  extraction  point.  Figure  4  provides  an  example  of  two 
commercially available tags whose size is comparable to the size of the corn and 
soy grain. The RFID Grain Tracking Tag is a passive RFID device, that is, it does 
not contain a battery and is powered solely by the electromagnetic field generated 
by the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the 
tag. 

The  physical  materials  that  constitute  the  tag’s  packaging  are  magnetic, 
durable, and non-toxic. A magnetic component is chosen so that the tags may be 
extracted from the grain. Durable exterior is needed so that the tag’s packaging 
does not wear appreciably after thousands of cycles of reuse. Non-toxic will be 
used so that what little wear that does occur as the tag jostles with its neighboring 
grain does not contaminate the grain.

The  antenna  receives  and  stores  electromagnetic  energy  from  the  RFID 
Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer.  After  sufficient  energy  has  been  received  and 
stored,  the  remainder  of  the  circuit  becomes  active.  The  density  of  the 
Reader/Writer transmitter on times in the message bit stream is high enough to 
keep the tag circuitry powered throughout a given operation. The state machine 
controls the sequencing and timing of these three operational commands: 

If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  ID” 
command from the RFID Grain Tracking Reader/Writer device, the State 
Machine reads the tag’s identification number (ID) from the non-volatile 
Read-only  memory  and  sends  this  ID  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking 
Reader/Writer via the RF Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “read  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine reads the tag’s ID from the Read-only Memory, appends all data 
in the non-volatile Read-write Memory to the ID, and sends the composite 
message  back  to  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer  via  the  RF 
Transmitter and Antenna. 
If  the  RF  Receiver  successfully  receives  and  decodes  a  “write  data” 
command  from  the  RFID  Grain  Tracking  Reader/Writer,  the  State 
Machine writes the received bits into the non-volatile Read-write Memory. 
The  capacity  of  the  non-volatile  Read-only  Memory  is  sufficient  to 
contain the tag ID information. This memory space is fixed and set at the time that 
the tag is manufactured. The capacity of the non-volatile Read-write Memory is 
sufficient to contain the maximum number of sets of data that a tag is expected to 
receive throughout a single grain tracking cycle.

Tag Dispenser 

 

Figure 8 shows the RFID grain chip tag dispenser, reader/writer and the 
RFID tags and grain in free falling mode, similar to that which would be used in a 
combine  grain  bin.    Conceptually,  the  grain  tracking  tags  dispenser  consists  of 
tags  tank,  dispensing  door,  solitron,  tags  guide,  and  control  electronics  (Figure 
9a). The tags tank is filled in with RFID tags. The tags dispensing door will open 
when a single tag needs to be dispensed. It consists of a disk connected to a rod. 
The  other  end  of  the  rod  is  inserted  into  a  solitron.  When  a  positive  current  is 
applied to the solitron, the rod is pulled in, thus the dispensing door disk opens the 
hole in the bottom of the tags tank and a single tag is released into the tags guide 
pipe. When a negative current is applied to the solitron, it pushes the rod out, thus 
closing the dispensing hole. Tags guide pipe allows directing the released tag to 
an appropriate location to be released into the grain stream.

Tag dispenser can be used to dispense tags into a stream of grain moved 
by the belt-based grain handling system, into a stream of freely falling grain, and 
into  a  stream  of  grain  moved  by  an  auger.  In  the  belt-based  grain  handling 
systems, the dispenser is located above the belt and its tags guide pipe is directed 
towards the belt (Figure 9b). In the case of a freely falling grain, the dispenser is 
located next to the free fall volume and its tags guide pipe is directed towards the 
falling grain. In the case of an auger-based grain handling system, the dispenser 
tags guide pipe is directly inserted into the auger pipe or is positioned above the 
auger intake system. 
 

Tag Remover 

 

The  tag  remover  combined  with  the  reader/writer  is  show  in  Figure  10.  
This depiction presents the approach which could be used for removing the tags 
from free falling grain from an auger spout or grain flowing out the bottom of a 
truck or rail hopper. Conceptually, the magnetic grain tracking tags belt remover 
consists of a moving belt, permanent magnet located inside the belt, and a storage 
box  for  removed  tags  (Figure  11a).  The  permanent  magnet  pulls  up  metal-
cowered RFID tags. The tags are then moved by the tags removing belt to the tags 
storage  box.  Tags  storage  box  should  be  positioned  right  at  the  edge  of  the 
permanent magnet, thus allowing the captured tags to be immediately released to 
the storage box. The dimensions of remover, speed of the tags removing belt, and 
the power of the permanent magnet are defined by the deployment environment.

deployment with a belt-based grain handling system. 
 
 

Tags remover can be used to remove tags from a stream of grain moved by 
the belt-based grain handling system and from a stream of freely falling grain. In 
the belt-based grain handling systems, the tags removing belt is positioned above 
the  grain  belt  and  the  tags  storage  box  is located  next  to  the  grain  belt  (Figure 
11b). In the case of freely falling grain, the tags removing belt is positioned along 
 
12

the path of the falling grain and the tags storage box is placed right below the tags 
removing belt. In both cases, the side of the tags removal belt close to the grain 
moves  in  the  direction  of  the  storage  box,  thus  moving  the  pulled  tags  to  the 
storage  box.  In  the  case  of  an  auger-based  grain  handling  system,  the  tags 
removing belt can be positioned just above the auger intake system. 
 

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 

 
 
The  proposed  system  shows  great  potential  for  tracking  grain  and  grain 
attributes  while  improving  food  security  and  efficiency  of  the  agricultural  food 
supply  chain.    This  system  has  the  ability  to:  1)  trace  back,  with  visualization 
tools, the entire transportation/movement of grain from the end use/processor to 
storage, road transport back to the field of harvest and origination of seed stock, 
2) query the data base for information/location of grain with specific attributes or 
characteristics,  3)  link  to  other  spatial  and  non-spatial  database  for  identifying 
other  attribute  information  associated  with  the  grain,  and  finally,  4)  identifying 
alternative sources of food and export safe grain when potential contamination or 
agro-bio-terrorism events occur.  Additional work is underway to develop and test 
the various components of the system.  Work is also needed to further evaluate 
the economic feasibility of the technology.
