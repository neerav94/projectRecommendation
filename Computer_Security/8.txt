ABSTRACT 
This  paper  presents  and  discusses  the  design  and  development  of  a  radio  frequency  identification  based  library  books  security 
system. This design is of two sections; one is the transmitter (tag) and the other one is the receiver (reader). These two sections 
enable the library personnel to know when a book is taken and when it is intact through the help of the alarm system connected to 
the  system.  In  Terms  of  results  obtained  from  the  design,  the  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD)  at  the  receiver  module  shows  the 
status of the tagged books. The LCD shows the status of the tagged books on the shelf as either “TAKEN” or “INTACT” when a 
book is absent or present respectively. A light emitting diode (LED) corresponding to each sensory node on the receiver section 
that switches ON or OFF when a book is present or absent from the shelf. An alarm circuit integrated on the transmitter section 
sounds an alarm whenever any book is taken from the shelf. The system is applicable in libraries to secure reserved books, it is 
readily applicable in supermarkets to secure goods on display and it can be used to secure cars in public car parks.

Before  time,  library  automation  has  been  carried  out  by  bar

wasted  to  carry  out  the  running  of  the  library.  With  the 
emergence of RFID technology, the whole library automation 
has become a lot easier as Library access, Inventory and total

shortcoming of the research  work is the  fact that upon theft, 
there  was  no  interface  that  observes  or  keeps  track  of  the 
tagged materials, only an alarm system was present [6].   
 
More  so,  M.M.Ollivier  (1995)  “RFID  a  new  solution

use  of  RFID  as  a  means  of  securing  premises  and  materials 
for  the  first  time.  This  now  justifies  the  efforts  geared

Every electronic device and system requires power supply to 
perform whatever function they are to serve. But determining 
what supply is critical to this system, supply needed by each 
section of this system goes a long way to tell what supply the 
system would be needing, the contact sensor needs a DC full 
time supply at +5 volts so do the microcontroller and the RF 
transmitter  but  can  require  more  than  +5  volts  to  as  high  as 
+12  volts  depending  on  how  far  one  would  like  the 
transmission to travel to. The alarm circuitry also operates at 
+5 volts but for louder beep can also be operated to as high as 
24 volts DC. The essence of this break down reveals that all 
section  of  the  hardware  requires  only  DC  volts  at  a 
magnitude  of  between  +5  volts  to  +9  volts.  Therefore, 
attaching  a  battery  to  the  system  to  construct  the  individual 
DC voltage ranges is in place.

3.2 Sensors    
Its role is to monitor the presence of books on a shelf and the 
absence  from  the  shelf,  the  sensor  is  not  different  from  a 
contact switch, when it makes contact, it completes the circuit 
and when it doesn’t the circuit becomes open.    
 
3.3 Microcontroller    
The  controller  used  in  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver 
section is an 18 pin IC named PIC16F628A; it stands central 
in  the  over-all  workings  of  the  system.  The  controller,  like 
every  other  digital  IC  requires  power  (+5  volts  DC  VDD), 
ground  or  negative  supply  (VSS)  and  a  clock  oscillatory 
network.    

      

    
 
Figure 3: Circuit diagram of the microcontroller section    
 
 
On the clock network is a  crystal oscillatory capacitor and a 
ceramic  capacitor  connected  together  to  ground.    This 
network  stands  so  important  for  the  following  reasons.  The 
crystal  first  of  all  is  the  heart  and  generates  the  heartbeat  to 
pulse  the  controller  each  step  all  the  way,  then  power  is 
applied to the controller. It waits to be pulsed to execute each 
instruction residing inside it. As each pulse is generated, each 
code  is  executed  and  on  and  on  it  goes  until  all  codes  are 
fully executed. Secondly, the microcontroller runs an internal 
frequency  of  ¼  of  the  external  frequency  obtained  from  the 
crystal oscillatory capacitor. As used in this design, a 4MHz 
crystal  was connected externally, the controller would get ¼ 
of  this  which  is  1MHz  will  then  be  used  by  the  controller 
oscillates,  an  inverse  of  this  is  1µsecond  which  is  the  total 
time  taken  to  execute  one  cycle  instruction  of  code.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  crystal  cannot  start  in  its  own 
without the help of the ceramic capacitors connected on each 
tag, on power up, the ceramic starts the crystal and in turn the 
crystal starts the controller all the way [5, 12, 14].

3.4 Microcontroller Software    
The  microcontroller  is  programmed  using  the  C  procedural 
language. The environment in which the program was written 
is 
for  PIC 
microcontrollers.  The  software  assisted  in  utilizing  the 
management  of  the  sensory  unit  for  the  transmitter  section 
and  also  to  control  the  output  on  the  LCD  on  the  receiver 
section [12].

3.5 Alarm    
The alarm section is such that gives an audible indication 
when any or all books are lifted off the shelf.    

    

Figure 4: Circuit diagram of the alarm section    

 
 
 
It is an arrangement of transistor as a switch and a buzzer, the 
buzzer requiring +9 volts DC cannot be connected directly to 
the  controller.  Transistor  as  a  switch  as  used  to  connect 
ground supply to the negative terminal of the buzzer through 
the  emitter  of  the  transistor  to  ground.  A  network  was 
adopted,  a  transistor  as  a  switch,  a  resistor  was  connected 
from  the  microcontroller  pin  configures  to  control  the  pump 
to the base of an NPN transistor. The resistor is to reduce the 
voltage  and  current  flowing  into  the  base  of  the  transistor, 
since  it  should  be  used  as  a  switch  very  little  amount  of 
voltage is needed to activate the base, as little as 0.7 volts DC 
is enough.

ABSTRACT 
This  paper  presents  and  discusses  the  design  and  development  of  a  radio  frequency  identification  based  library  books  security 
system. This design is of two sections; one is the transmitter (tag) and the other one is the receiver (reader). These two sections

the  system.  In  Terms  of  results  obtained  from  the  design,  the  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD)  at  the  receiver  module  shows  the 
status of the tagged books. The LCD shows the status of the tagged books on the shelf as either “TAKEN” or “INTACT” when a 
book is absent or present respectively. A light emitting diode (LED) corresponding to each sensory node on the receiver section 
that switches ON or OFF when a book is present or absent from the shelf. An alarm circuit integrated on the transmitter section 
sounds an alarm whenever any book is taken from the shelf. The system is applicable in libraries to secure reserved books, it is 
readily applicable in supermarkets to secure goods on display and it can be used to secure cars in public car parks.

receiver unit (Reader) ; it has a power section, a sensory unit, 
the controller, the RF transmitter  module, LCD, RF receiver 
module and an alarm circuitry. Explaining each sector would 
give a comprehensive understanding of the system in whole.    
 
3.1 Power Supply    
Every electronic device and system requires power supply to 
perform whatever function they are to serve. But determining 
what supply is critical to this system, supply needed by each 
section of this system goes a long way to tell what supply the 
system would be needing, the contact sensor needs a DC full 
time supply at +5 volts so do the microcontroller and the RF 
transmitter  but  can  require  more  than  +5  volts  to  as  high  as 
+12  volts  depending  on  how  far  one  would  like  the 
transmission to travel to. The alarm circuitry also operates at 
+5 volts but for louder beep can also be operated to as high as 
24 volts DC. The essence of this break down reveals that all 
section  of  the  hardware  requires  only  DC  volts  at  a 
magnitude  of  between  +5  volts  to  +9  volts.  Therefore, 
attaching  a  battery  to  the  system  to  construct  the  individual 
DC voltage ranges is in place.

3.2 Sensors    
Its role is to monitor the presence of books on a shelf and the 
absence  from  the  shelf,  the  sensor  is  not  different  from  a 
contact switch, when it makes contact, it completes the circuit 
and when it doesn’t the circuit becomes open.    
 
3.3 Microcontroller    
The  controller  used  in  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver 
section is an 18 pin IC named PIC16F628A; it stands central 
in  the  over-all  workings  of  the  system.  The  controller,  like 
every  other  digital  IC  requires  power  (+5  volts  DC  VDD), 
ground  or  negative  supply  (VSS)  and  a  clock  oscillatory 
network.    

      

    
 
Figure 3: Circuit diagram of the microcontroller section    
 
 
On the clock network is a  crystal oscillatory capacitor and a 
ceramic  capacitor  connected  together  to  ground.    This 
network  stands  so  important  for  the  following  reasons.  The 
crystal  first  of  all  is  the  heart  and  generates  the  heartbeat  to 
pulse  the  controller  each  step  all  the  way,  then  power  is 
applied to the controller. It waits to be pulsed to execute each 
instruction residing inside it. As each pulse is generated, each 
code  is  executed  and  on  and  on  it  goes  until  all  codes  are 
fully executed. Secondly, the microcontroller runs an internal 
frequency  of  ¼  of  the  external  frequency  obtained  from  the 
crystal oscillatory capacitor. As used in this design, a 4MHz 
crystal  was connected externally, the controller would get ¼ 
of  this  which  is  1MHz  will  then  be  used  by  the  controller 
oscillates,  an  inverse  of  this  is  1µsecond  which  is  the  total 
time  taken  to  execute  one  cycle  instruction  of  code.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  crystal  cannot  start  in  its  own 
without the help of the ceramic capacitors connected on each 
tag, on power up, the ceramic starts the crystal and in turn the 
crystal starts the controller all the way [5, 12, 14].

3.4 Microcontroller Software    
The  microcontroller  is  programmed  using  the  C  procedural

is 
for  PIC 
microcontrollers.  The  software  assisted  in  utilizing  the 
management  of  the  sensory  unit  for  the  transmitter  section 
and  also  to  control  the  output  on  the  LCD  on  the  receiver

The alarm section is such that gives an audible indication 
when any or all books are lifted off the shelf.

It is an arrangement of transistor as a switch and a buzzer, the 
buzzer requiring +9 volts DC cannot be connected directly to 
the  controller.  Transistor  as  a  switch  as  used  to  connect 
ground supply to the negative terminal of the buzzer through 
the  emitter  of  the  transistor  to  ground.  A  network  was 
adopted,  a  transistor  as  a  switch,  a  resistor  was  connected 
from  the  microcontroller  pin  configures  to  control  the  pump 
to the base of an NPN transistor. The resistor is to reduce the 
voltage  and  current  flowing  into  the  base  of  the  transistor, 
since  it  should  be  used  as  a  switch  very  little  amount  of 
voltage is needed to activate the base, as little as 0.7 volts DC 
is enough.

ABSTRACT 
This  paper  presents  and  discusses  the  design  and  development  of  a  radio  frequency  identification  based  library  books  security 
system. This design is of two sections; one is the transmitter (tag) and the other one is the receiver (reader). These two sections 
enable the library personnel to know when a book is taken and when it is intact through the help of the alarm system connected to 
the  system.  In  Terms  of  results  obtained  from  the  design,  the  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD)  at  the  receiver  module  shows  the 
status of the tagged books. The LCD shows the status of the tagged books on the shelf as either “TAKEN” or “INTACT” when a 
book is absent or present respectively. A light emitting diode (LED) corresponding to each sensory node on the receiver section 
that switches ON or OFF when a book is present or absent from the shelf. An alarm circuit integrated on the transmitter section 
sounds an alarm whenever any book is taken from the shelf. The system is applicable in libraries to secure reserved books, it is 
readily applicable in supermarkets to secure goods on display and it can be used to secure cars in public car parks.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  an      automatic 
identification  method,  relying  on  storing  and  remotely 
retrieving  data  using  devices  called 
  RFID  tags  or 
transponders.  An  RFID  tag  is  an  object  that  can  be  attached 
to  or  incorporated  into  a  product,  animal,  or  person  for  the 
purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  Chip-based 
RFID  tags  contain  silicon  chips  and  antennae.  Passive  tags 
require no internal power source, whereas active tags require 
a power source

2. LITERATURE REVIEW    
 
Before  time,  library  automation  has  been  carried  out  by  bar 
coding  or  manual  inventory  to  monitor  books  and  its 
movement  within  the  library.  A  whole  lot  of  man  hours  is 
wasted  to  carry  out  the  running  of  the  library.  With  the 
emergence of RFID technology, the whole library automation 
has become a lot easier as Library access, Inventory and total 
library  can  be  interfaced  with  a  PC  (Personal  Computer) 
[2,3].    According  to  Daniel  McPherson  and  Vinod  Chachra. 
(2003)  who  worked  on  “Personal  privacy  and  use  of  RFID 
technology  in  libraries”.  His  paper  talked  about  RFID  in 
libraries  as  a  means  privacy  control  while  generating 
information off tagged objects within the libraries. The main 
shortcoming of the research  work is the  fact that upon theft, 
there  was  no  interface  that  observes  or  keeps  track  of  the 
tagged materials, only an alarm system was present [6].   
 
More  so,  M.M.Ollivier  (1995)  “RFID  a  new  solution 
technology  for  security  problems”.  His  paper  addresses  the 
use  of  RFID  as  a  means  of  securing  premises  and  materials 
for  the  first  time.  This  now  justifies  the  efforts  geared 
towards  the  design  and  development  of  an  RFID  based 
library  books  security  system  to  address  the  issue  of  theft 
involved [9].   

    

3. DESIGN PROCEDURE / METHODOLOGY   
   
The  project  in  question  is  security  system  that  monitors 
books  on  a  shelf  and  wirelessly  communicates  the  status  of

liquid  crystal  display  unit.  The  mode  of 
communication  is  wireless  using  a  radio  frequency  module, 
one to transmit the status of books on the shelf and a receiver 
that receives this status and interprets them to a display unit.

ABSTRACT 
This  paper  presents  and  discusses  the  design  and  development  of  a  radio  frequency  identification  based  library  books  security 
system. This design is of two sections; one is the transmitter (tag) and the other one is the receiver (reader). These two sections 
enable the library personnel to know when a book is taken and when it is intact through the help of the alarm system connected to 
the  system.  In  Terms  of  results  obtained  from  the  design,  the  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD)  at  the  receiver  module  shows  the 
status of the tagged books. The LCD shows the status of the tagged books on the shelf as either “TAKEN” or “INTACT” when a 
book is absent or present respectively. A light emitting diode (LED) corresponding to each sensory node on the receiver section 
that switches ON or OFF when a book is present or absent from the shelf. An alarm circuit integrated on the transmitter section 
sounds an alarm whenever any book is taken from the shelf. The system is applicable in libraries to secure reserved books, it is 
readily applicable in supermarkets to secure goods on display and it can be used to secure cars in public car parks.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  an      automatic 
identification  method,  relying  on  storing  and  remotely 
retrieving  data  using  devices  called 
  RFID  tags  or 
transponders.  An  RFID  tag  is  an  object  that  can  be  attached 
to  or  incorporated  into  a  product,  animal,  or  person  for  the 
purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  Chip-based 
RFID  tags  contain  silicon  chips  and  antennae.  Passive  tags 
require no internal power source, whereas active tags require 
a power source

2. LITERATURE REVIEW    
 
Before  time,  library  automation  has  been  carried  out  by  bar 
coding  or  manual  inventory  to  monitor  books  and  its 
movement  within  the  library.  A  whole  lot  of  man  hours  is 
wasted  to  carry  out  the  running  of  the  library.  With  the 
emergence of RFID technology, the whole library automation 
has become a lot easier as Library access, Inventory and total 
library  can  be  interfaced  with  a  PC  (Personal  Computer) 
[2,3].    According  to  Daniel  McPherson  and  Vinod  Chachra. 
(2003)  who  worked  on  “Personal  privacy  and  use  of  RFID 
technology  in  libraries”.  His  paper  talked  about  RFID  in 
libraries  as  a  means  privacy  control  while  generating 
information off tagged objects within the libraries. The main 
shortcoming of the research  work is the  fact that upon theft, 
there  was  no  interface  that  observes  or  keeps  track  of  the 
tagged materials, only an alarm system was present [6].   
 
More  so,  M.M.Ollivier  (1995)  “RFID  a  new  solution 
technology  for  security  problems”.  His  paper  addresses  the 
use  of  RFID  as  a  means  of  securing  premises  and  materials 
for  the  first  time.  This  now  justifies  the  efforts  geared 
towards  the  design  and  development  of  an  RFID  based 
library  books  security  system  to  address  the  issue  of  theft 
involved [9].   

    

3. DESIGN PROCEDURE / METHODOLOGY   
   
The  project  in  question  is  security  system  that  monitors 
books  on  a  shelf  and  wirelessly  communicates  the  status  of 
shelf 
liquid  crystal  display  unit.  The  mode  of 
communication  is  wireless  using  a  radio  frequency  module, 
one to transmit the status of books on the shelf and a receiver 
that receives this status and interprets them to a display unit.

Above is the circuit diagram of the transmitter unit (Tag) and 
receiver unit (Reader) ; it has a power section, a sensory unit, 
the controller, the RF transmitter  module, LCD, RF receiver 
module and an alarm circuitry. Explaining each sector would 
give a comprehensive understanding of the system in whole.    
 
3.1 Power Supply    
Every electronic device and system requires power supply to 
perform whatever function they are to serve. But determining 
what supply is critical to this system, supply needed by each 
section of this system goes a long way to tell what supply the 
system would be needing, the contact sensor needs a DC full 
time supply at +5 volts so do the microcontroller and the RF 
transmitter  but  can  require  more  than  +5  volts  to  as  high  as 
+12  volts  depending  on  how  far  one  would  like  the 
transmission to travel to. The alarm circuitry also operates at 
+5 volts but for louder beep can also be operated to as high as 
24 volts DC. The essence of this break down reveals that all 
section  of  the  hardware  requires  only  DC  volts  at  a 
magnitude  of  between  +5  volts  to  +9  volts.  Therefore, 
attaching  a  battery  to  the  system  to  construct  the  individual 
DC voltage ranges is in place.

3.2 Sensors    
Its role is to monitor the presence of books on a shelf and the 
absence  from  the  shelf,  the  sensor  is  not  different  from  a 
contact switch, when it makes contact, it completes the circuit 
and when it doesn’t the circuit becomes open.    
 
3.3 Microcontroller    
The  controller  used  in  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver 
section is an 18 pin IC named PIC16F628A; it stands central 
in  the  over-all  workings  of  the  system.  The  controller,  like 
every  other  digital  IC  requires  power  (+5  volts  DC  VDD), 
ground  or  negative  supply  (VSS)  and  a  clock  oscillatory 
network.    

      

    
 
Figure 3: Circuit diagram of the microcontroller section    
 
 
On the clock network is a  crystal oscillatory capacitor and a 
ceramic  capacitor  connected  together  to  ground.    This 
network  stands  so  important  for  the  following  reasons.  The 
crystal  first  of  all  is  the  heart  and  generates  the  heartbeat  to 
pulse  the  controller  each  step  all  the  way,  then  power  is 
applied to the controller. It waits to be pulsed to execute each 
instruction residing inside it. As each pulse is generated, each 
code  is  executed  and  on  and  on  it  goes  until  all  codes  are 
fully executed. Secondly, the microcontroller runs an internal 
frequency  of  ¼  of  the  external  frequency  obtained  from  the 
crystal oscillatory capacitor. As used in this design, a 4MHz 
crystal  was connected externally, the controller would get ¼ 
of  this  which  is  1MHz  will  then  be  used  by  the  controller 
oscillates,  an  inverse  of  this  is  1µsecond  which  is  the  total 
time  taken  to  execute  one  cycle  instruction  of  code.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  crystal  cannot  start  in  its  own 
without the help of the ceramic capacitors connected on each 
tag, on power up, the ceramic starts the crystal and in turn the 
crystal starts the controller all the way [5, 12, 14].

3.4 Microcontroller Software    
The  microcontroller  is  programmed  using  the  C  procedural 
language. The environment in which the program was written 
is 
for  PIC 
microcontrollers.  The  software  assisted  in  utilizing  the 
management  of  the  sensory  unit  for  the  transmitter  section 
and  also  to  control  the  output  on  the  LCD  on  the  receiver 
section [12].

3.5 Alarm    
The alarm section is such that gives an audible indication 
when any or all books are lifted off the shelf.

It is an arrangement of transistor as a switch and a buzzer, the 
buzzer requiring +9 volts DC cannot be connected directly to 
the  controller.  Transistor  as  a  switch  as  used  to  connect 
ground supply to the negative terminal of the buzzer through 
the  emitter  of  the  transistor  to  ground.  A  network  was 
adopted,  a  transistor  as  a  switch,  a  resistor  was  connected 
from  the  microcontroller  pin  configures  to  control  the  pump 
to the base of an NPN transistor. The resistor is to reduce the 
voltage  and  current  flowing  into  the  base  of  the  transistor, 
since  it  should  be  used  as  a  switch  very  little  amount  of 
voltage is needed to activate the base, as little as 0.7 volts DC 
is enough.

the  emitter  of  the  transistor  to  ground.  A  network  was 
adopted,  a  transistor  as  a  switch,  a  resistor  was  connected 
from  the  microcontroller  pin  configures  to  control  the  pump 
to the base of an NPN transistor. The resistor is to reduce the 
voltage  and  current  flowing  into  the  base  of  the  transistor, 
since  it  should  be  used  as  a  switch  very  little  amount  of 
voltage is needed to activate the base, as little as 0.7 volts DC 
is enough.

5. CONCLUSION   
 
It  is  quite  clear  from  the  above  discussion  that  an  RFID 
system  may  be  a  comprehensive  system  that  addresses 
book security needs of a library. RFID in the library is not a 
threat 
if  best  practices  and  guidelines  are  followed 
religiously.  That  is,  it  frees  staff  to  do  more  user  service 
tasks. The technology saves money too and quickly gives a 
return  on  investment.        It  is  important  to  educate  library 
staff  and  library  users  about  RFID  technology  before 
implementing  a  program.        Due  to  the  high  cost  of  RFID 
system  tools  and  devices,  this  system  can  be  implemented 
to  secure  important  books  in  the  library.  A  general 
implementation  in  the  library  can  be  done  as  the  price  of 
RFID modules lowers in the future [5].

ABSTRACT 
This  paper  presents  and  discusses  the  design  and  development  of  a  radio  frequency  identification  based  library  books  security 
system. This design is of two sections; one is the transmitter (tag) and the other one is the receiver (reader). These two sections 
enable the library personnel to know when a book is taken and when it is intact through the help of the alarm system connected to 
the  system.  In  Terms  of  results  obtained  from  the  design,  the  Liquid  Crystal  Display  (LCD)  at  the  receiver  module  shows  the 
status of the tagged books. The LCD shows the status of the tagged books on the shelf as either “TAKEN” or “INTACT” when a 
book is absent or present respectively. A light emitting diode (LED) corresponding to each sensory node on the receiver section 
that switches ON or OFF when a book is present or absent from the shelf. An alarm circuit integrated on the transmitter section 
sounds an alarm whenever any book is taken from the shelf. The system is applicable in libraries to secure reserved books, it is 
readily applicable in supermarkets to secure goods on display and it can be used to secure cars in public car parks.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  an      automatic 
identification  method,  relying  on  storing  and  remotely 
retrieving  data  using  devices  called 
  RFID  tags  or 
transponders.  An  RFID  tag  is  an  object  that  can  be  attached 
to  or  incorporated  into  a  product,  animal,  or  person  for  the 
purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  Chip-based 
RFID  tags  contain  silicon  chips  and  antennae.  Passive  tags 
require no internal power source, whereas active tags require 
a power source

2. LITERATURE REVIEW    
 
Before  time,  library  automation  has  been  carried  out  by  bar 
coding  or  manual  inventory  to  monitor  books  and  its 
movement  within  the  library.  A  whole  lot  of  man  hours  is 
wasted  to  carry  out  the  running  of  the  library.  With  the 
emergence of RFID technology, the whole library automation 
has become a lot easier as Library access, Inventory and total 
library  can  be  interfaced  with  a  PC  (Personal  Computer) 
[2,3].    According  to  Daniel  McPherson  and  Vinod  Chachra. 
(2003)  who  worked  on  “Personal  privacy  and  use  of  RFID 
technology  in  libraries”.  His  paper  talked  about  RFID  in 
libraries  as  a  means  privacy  control  while  generating 
information off tagged objects within the libraries. The main 
shortcoming of the research  work is the  fact that upon theft, 
there  was  no  interface  that  observes  or  keeps  track  of  the 
tagged materials, only an alarm system was present [6].   
 
More  so,  M.M.Ollivier  (1995)  “RFID  a  new  solution 
technology  for  security  problems”.  His  paper  addresses  the 
use  of  RFID  as  a  means  of  securing  premises  and  materials 
for  the  first  time.  This  now  justifies  the  efforts  geared 
towards  the  design  and  development  of  an  RFID  based 
library  books  security  system  to  address  the  issue  of  theft 
involved [9].   

    

3. DESIGN PROCEDURE / METHODOLOGY   
   
The  project  in  question  is  security  system  that  monitors 
books  on  a  shelf  and  wirelessly  communicates  the  status  of 
shelf 
liquid  crystal  display  unit.  The  mode  of 
communication  is  wireless  using  a  radio  frequency  module, 
one to transmit the status of books on the shelf and a receiver 
that receives this status and interprets them to a display unit.

Above is the circuit diagram of the transmitter unit (Tag) and 
receiver unit (Reader) ; it has a power section, a sensory unit, 
the controller, the RF transmitter  module, LCD, RF receiver 
module and an alarm circuitry. Explaining each sector would 
give a comprehensive understanding of the system in whole.    
 
3.1 Power Supply    
Every electronic device and system requires power supply to 
perform whatever function they are to serve. But determining 
what supply is critical to this system, supply needed by each 
section of this system goes a long way to tell what supply the 
system would be needing, the contact sensor needs a DC full 
time supply at +5 volts so do the microcontroller and the RF 
transmitter  but  can  require  more  than  +5  volts  to  as  high  as 
+12  volts  depending  on  how  far  one  would  like  the 
transmission to travel to. The alarm circuitry also operates at 
+5 volts but for louder beep can also be operated to as high as 
24 volts DC. The essence of this break down reveals that all 
section  of  the  hardware  requires  only  DC  volts  at  a 
magnitude  of  between  +5  volts  to  +9  volts.  Therefore, 
attaching  a  battery  to  the  system  to  construct  the  individual 
DC voltage ranges is in place.

3.2 Sensors    
Its role is to monitor the presence of books on a shelf and the 
absence  from  the  shelf,  the  sensor  is  not  different  from  a 
contact switch, when it makes contact, it completes the circuit 
and when it doesn’t the circuit becomes open.    
 
3.3 Microcontroller    
The  controller  used  in  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver 
section is an 18 pin IC named PIC16F628A; it stands central 
in  the  over-all  workings  of  the  system.  The  controller,  like 
every  other  digital  IC  requires  power  (+5  volts  DC  VDD), 
ground  or  negative  supply  (VSS)  and  a  clock  oscillatory 
network.    

      

    
 
Figure 3: Circuit diagram of the microcontroller section    
 
 
On the clock network is a  crystal oscillatory capacitor and a 
ceramic  capacitor  connected  together  to  ground.    This 
network  stands  so  important  for  the  following  reasons.  The 
crystal  first  of  all  is  the  heart  and  generates  the  heartbeat  to 
pulse  the  controller  each  step  all  the  way,  then  power  is 
applied to the controller. It waits to be pulsed to execute each 
instruction residing inside it. As each pulse is generated, each 
code  is  executed  and  on  and  on  it  goes  until  all  codes  are 
fully executed. Secondly, the microcontroller runs an internal 
frequency  of  ¼  of  the  external  frequency  obtained  from  the 
crystal oscillatory capacitor. As used in this design, a 4MHz 
crystal  was connected externally, the controller would get ¼ 
of  this  which  is  1MHz  will  then  be  used  by  the  controller 
oscillates,  an  inverse  of  this  is  1µsecond  which  is  the  total 
time  taken  to  execute  one  cycle  instruction  of  code.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  crystal  cannot  start  in  its  own 
without the help of the ceramic capacitors connected on each 
tag, on power up, the ceramic starts the crystal and in turn the 
crystal starts the controller all the way [5, 12, 14].

3.4 Microcontroller Software    
The  microcontroller  is  programmed  using  the  C  procedural 
language. The environment in which the program was written 
is 
for  PIC 
microcontrollers.  The  software  assisted  in  utilizing  the 
management  of  the  sensory  unit  for  the  transmitter  section 
and  also  to  control  the  output  on  the  LCD  on  the  receiver 
section [12].   

is  a  design 

tool 

   

3.5 Alarm    
The alarm section is such that gives an audible indication 
when any or all books are lifted off the shelf.    

    

Figure 4: Circuit diagram of the alarm section    

 
 
 
It is an arrangement of transistor as a switch and a buzzer, the 
buzzer requiring +9 volts DC cannot be connected directly to 
the  controller.  Transistor  as  a  switch  as  used  to  connect 
ground supply to the negative terminal of the buzzer through 
the  emitter  of  the  transistor  to  ground.  A  network  was 
adopted,  a  transistor  as  a  switch,  a  resistor  was  connected 
from  the  microcontroller  pin  configures  to  control  the  pump 
to the base of an NPN transistor. The resistor is to reduce the 
voltage  and  current  flowing  into  the  base  of  the  transistor, 
since  it  should  be  used  as  a  switch  very  little  amount  of 
voltage is needed to activate the base, as little as 0.7 volts DC 
is enough.

These  RF  Transmitter  Modules  are  very  small 
in 
dimension  and  have  a  wide  operating  voltage  range  (3V-
12V).  The low cost RF Transmitter can be used to transmit 
signal  up  to  100  meters  (the  antenna  design,  working 
environment  and  supply  voltage  will  seriously  impact  the 
effective  distance).  It  is  good  for  short  distance,  battery 
power device development.

Soldered  the  antenna  to  the  RF  Receiver  Module,  There 
are  2  GND  on  the  module  which  are  internally  connected 
each other. Connect the 3pin header to your circuit so that 
the  GND  pin  connects  to  ground  of  the  circuit  board,  the 
VCC  pin  connects  to  VCC  of  the  circuit  board  and  the 
Data pin connects to your microcontroller’s I/O pin [11].

3.8. Construction    
Construction  was  done  in  three  stages,  transmitter,  receiver  and  the  wooden  shelf.  For  the  transmitter  and  receiver,  all  the 
components  are  connected  together  on  the  board  by  soldering  them  according  to  the  circuit  layout.  All  the  components  are 
soldered together on the same board according to the schematic diagram for the transmitter and receiver circuit respectively.

4. TESTING AND EXPECTED RESULT  
   
RFID Based Book Security System is able to identify tagged books on shelf display their status as either TAKEN or INTACT 
was  successfully  developed.  The  major  contribution  of  this  work  is  managing  to  write  a  functional  code  for  the  two 
Microcontrollers  to  communicate  with  each  other.  This  system  should  be  able  to  minimize  the  technical  human  error  while 
securing important library materials. The table below shows all the results;

5. CONCLUSION   
 
It  is  quite  clear  from  the  above  discussion  that  an  RFID 
system  may  be  a  comprehensive  system  that  addresses 
book security needs of a library. RFID in the library is not a 
threat 
if  best  practices  and  guidelines  are  followed 
religiously.  That  is,  it  frees  staff  to  do  more  user  service 
tasks. The technology saves money too and quickly gives a 
return  on  investment.        It  is  important  to  educate  library 
staff  and  library  users  about  RFID  technology  before 
implementing  a  program.        Due  to  the  high  cost  of  RFID 
system  tools  and  devices,  this  system  can  be  implemented 
to  secure  important  books  in  the  library.  A  general 
implementation  in  the  library  can  be  done  as  the  price  of 
RFID modules lowers in the future [5].
