ABSTRACT 
Information  security  plays  an  essential  role  during  internet  communication  in  today’s  era  of 
technology.  It  is  enormously  important  for  people  committing  e-transactions  like  online  shopping, 
money transfer etc. There are various methods that provide a means for secure commerce and payment 
to  private  communications  and  protecting  passwords.  Cryptography  and  Steganography  are  such 
methods. The principle  of cryptography is  to  manipulate the information  so that unintended receiver 
will not be able to understand however the principle of steganography is to mask the very presence of 
communication;  it  hides  the  existence  of  message.  Both  the  techniques  are  widely  used  to  prevent 
unintended  receiver’s  attacks  from  unauthorized  access.  This  paper  proposes  a  new  technique  that 
provides multilayer security by integrating cryptography with steganography.

Cryptography and Steganography are two techniques that help in sending vital information in a secret

mask the very presence of communication; it hides message under some media like image, audio and 
video. Cryptography [1] defines as the art and science of transforming data into a sequence of bits that 
appears as random and meaningless to a side observer or attacker. It comes from Greek words; crypto 
(secret)  and  graphy  (writing  or  drawing)

cryptography—attempts  to  identify  weaknesses  of  various  cryptographic  algorithms  and  their 
implementations to exploit them. The process of converting message (plain text) into unreadable form 
(cipher text) is  called encryption and the reverse process  is  called decryption. Steganography  [2]  also 
comes from the Greek steganos (covered) and  graphy (writing or drawing). Steganography  [1] can be 
defined  as  the  hiding  of  information  by  embedding  messages  within  other,  seemingly  harmless 
messages,  graphics  or  sounds.  The  first  steganographic  technique  was  developed  in  ancient  Greece 
around  440  B.C.  The  Greek  ruler  Histaeus  employed  an  early  version  of  steganography  which 
involved: shaving the head of a slave, tattooing the message on the slaves scalp, waiting for the growth 
of hair to  disclose the secret  message, and sending the slave on his  way to deliver the message. The 
recipient would have the slave’s head to uncover the message. The recipient would reply in the same 
form of steganography [1].

Different  methods  are  used  to  hide  message  in  media  such  as  image  steganography,  audio 
steganography and video steganography, depending on the type of cover file used. However there are 
very less papers available that present multilayer security using both cryptography and steganography.

In this research paper, combination of both the techniques is presented. Audio steganography is used 
but  prior  to  that,  message  is  encrypted  by  RSA  algorithm  to  make  communication  more  secure  and 
immune to unauthorized access. 
 
PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
Although cryptography and steganography techniques are separately used to secure data but still there 
is  a  requirement  of  technique  that  provide  more  level  of  security.  Crypticsteganography  is  such  a 
technique  that  provides  multilayer  security  by  merging  cryptography  with  steganography.  In  this 
proposed system first message is converted into cipher text by RSA algorithm and then cipher text is 
hidden  in  audio  using  LSB  audio  steganography  technique  similarly  at  reception  first  cipher  text  is 
reveal  from  audio  thereafter  it  decrypted  into  message  by  using  RSA  decryption.  So  this  technique 
combines the features of both cryptography and steganography and provides a higher level of security. 
It is better than either of the technique used separately.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
Security  has  always  been  an  important  issue  in  communication.  Crypticsteganography  combines  the 
features of both steganography and cryptography, and provides a high level of security. It satisfies the 
requirement  of  high  security  and  robustness  between  sender  and  receiver.  The  steganalysis  of  this 
technique  by  unintended  receiver  is  more  challenging  so  this  method  can  be  used  in  areas  where 
highly sensitive data is to transfer through network such as Banks, RAW agencies etc. There is a wide 
scope  of  future  work  in  this  proposed  method  such  as  a  new  algorithm  can  de  design  by  modifying 
RSA,  DES  or  AES  cryptographic  algorithm,  modification  can  also  be  done  in    least  significant  bit 
embedding technique.
