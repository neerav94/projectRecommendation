Abstract 
 
Medical  test  security  system  is  a  major  factor  in  our  society  especially  this  system  is  used  for  special  purpose  like 
inspection of many healthy man powers for a specific organization. In this project software is implement which is useful 
for detection of healthy man power to avoid the wrong way entry in Army, Navy & Air force i.e. Gov & Non Gov sector. 
In  this  system  first  of  all  candidate  registration  should  be  done  in  this  registration  candidate  firstly  give  their  home 
address  and  age.  By  using  thumb  pad  we  take  his  finger  print  for  identification  this  candidate  information  saved  in 
computer where three tests will be performed physical test, blood test and x-ray test. When candidate go for blood test 
here finger print is taken then fill up the detail of candidate. Then next test will be performed then details of all test of 
that candidate save in the form of barcode and also save in server. This server is under high authority. Then print out is 
taken out from printer.

Results 
 
This project gives the status of test of a human being and 
stores the data into the server which is much authorized. It 
gives  the  perfect  implementation  of  every  steps  followed 
in this project.

User from anywhere being GSM available can make a call 
to system to check the status of appliances or control them 
as  describe  in  fig  III.  System  in  return  checks  the 
authenticity  of 
the 
preconfigured  number  then  it  follows  the  instruction 
otherwise  it  discard  the  call.  As  Computer  receives  a  call 
timer  starts  and  it  automatically  discard  the  call  after  few 
seconds. The voice is understood by the Microsoft speech 
reorganization engine that is installed in the system. If the 
command  is  about  changing  the  status  of  appliances  it 
passes  the  signal  to  parallel  port  to  follow  the  instruction 
like  turn  the  appliances  on  or  off.  This  can  be  done 
through  relay  based  circuit.  If  command  is  to  check  the 
status  of  appliances  the  system  returns  the  voice  message 
to preconfigured number using  AT Commands telling the 
status of appliances.

Database 
 
The  rapid  increase  in  the  data  available  leads  to  the 
difficulty  for  analyzing  those  data  and  different  types  of 
framework  are  required  for  unearthing  useful  knowledge 
that can be to extracted from such databases. Data mining 
is  actually  an  integral  part  of  Knowledge  Discovery  in

Conclusion 
 
Medical  test  security  system  for  implementation  of  test 
security system is the main contributions of this proposed 
paper. The MTSS is better than other test security system 
as  server  is  under  high  authority  and  it  is  going  to  be 
fruitful  in  saving  the  time  in  case  of  large  database.  Our 
current  systems overcome all the  short-comings of all the 
security systems and capable of obtaining efficient result.
