Abstract: This paper presents a security system  which permits the  notification through 
mobile phone for some breach of close produced in any area supervised by the sensors 
and  the  operating  from  a  distance,  through  mobile  phone  too,  of  any  section  of  the 
warning block in order to discourage and reprisal  the intruder. 
 
Keywords:  mobile  phone,  muvement  sensor,  intruder,  microcontroller,  programme, 
SIM card. 
 
 
 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

A  system  of  modern  supervision  must  have  the 
capacity to detect, discourage and prevent or delay 
any  attempt  of  penetrating  the  protected  objectives 
or zones and to accumulate material concerning this 
event. 
 
The system presented in this work carries out all the 
above  mentioned  conditions  with  the  observation 
that 
the  function  of  realizing  a  documentary 
material  is  deficient  in  the  absence  of  a  video 
system  even  if  it  can  memorize  the  chronological 
order  and  the  exact  moment  of  attacking  the 
supervised points by the intruder. 
 
However, this disadvantage can be easily surpassed 
by coupling  this system  with the Webcam security 
system [see ref.]. 
 
 

2. THE  BLOCK  SCHEME 

 

The security  system presented in  fig. 1  is  made  up 
of the central unit, the input block, the output block, 
the  detection  system  for  the  intruder,  the  warning 

the  peripherical 

the  supervised  circuit  of 

block, the serial interface,  the distance information 
transmitting block and the supply block. 
 
 
2.1. The central unit 
 
The  central  unit  is  made  up  of  the  microcontroller 
AT89C52, 
selection  block 
GAL22V10,  the  parallel  input  port  on  8  bits 
MM74HCT541,  the  parallel  output  port  on  8  bits 
MM74HCT574, 
the 
microcontroller ADM 691, the ROM serial memory 
and the configuration switch with 8 channels. 
 
 
2.2. The input and output blocks 
 
The input and output blocks, shown in fig. 2 and 3, 
are formed by the integrated optocouplors LTV844 
and  they  have  the  role  to  realize  the  galvanic 
isolation between the central unit, on one hand and 
the sensors, respectively the sections of the warning 
block  on the other hand

2.4. The warning block  
 
The  warning  block  is  formed  by  eight  sections

acustic  and  light  signals,  can  shut  off  doors,  start 
engines, flood spaces, a.s.o. 
 
 
2.5. The serial interface 
 
The serial interface RS232 permits a baudrate up to 
200KB/s and realizes the bidirectional link with the 
GSM modem. 
 
 
2.6. The distance information transmitting block 
 
The  distance  information  transmitting  block  is 
made  up  of  a  GSM  modem  from  Telit  GM682-
PCS/_GPRS/_GSM  family,  endowed  with  a  SIM 
card and a mobile phone. 
 
The  transmission  between  the  two  modules  takes 
place through some bidirectional SMS-s.

2.3. The intruder detection block 
 
The  intruder  detection  block  is  made  up  of  eight 
movement sensors or any type of sensors on  

 
 
condition that these could give the 0 output logical 
level when they are activated. 
 
 
2.4. The warning block  
 
The  warning  block  is  formed  by  eight  sections 
which,  when  they  are  activated,  can  generate 
acustic  and  light  signals,  can  shut  off  doors,  start 
engines, flood spaces, a.s.o. 
 
 
2.5. The serial interface 
 
The serial interface RS232 permits a baudrate up to 
200KB/s and realizes the bidirectional link with the 
GSM modem. 
 
 
2.6. The distance information transmitting block 
 
The  distance  information  transmitting  block  is 
made  up  of  a  GSM  modem  from  Telit  GM682-
PCS/_GPRS/_GSM  family,  endowed  with  a  SIM 
card and a mobile phone. 
 
The  transmission  between  the  two  modules  takes 
place through some bidirectional SMS-s. 

2.7. The supply block 
 
The  supply  block  has  three  stabilized  voltage 
sources,  two  of  12V  and  one  of  5V,  realized  with 
the  three  terminal  integrated  circuits  LM7812  and 
LM7805.

Abstract: This paper presents a security system  which permits the  notification through 
mobile phone for some breach of close produced in any area supervised by the sensors

warning block in order to discourage and reprisal  the intruder.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

A  system  of  modern  supervision  must  have  the 
capacity to detect, discourage and prevent or delay 
any  attempt  of  penetrating  the  protected  objectives 
or zones and to accumulate material concerning this 
event. 
 
The system presented in this work carries out all the 
above  mentioned  conditions  with  the  observation 
that 
the  function  of  realizing  a  documentary 
material  is  deficient  in  the  absence  of  a  video 
system  even  if  it  can  memorize  the  chronological 
order  and  the  exact  moment  of  attacking  the 
supervised points by the intruder. 
 
However, this disadvantage can be easily surpassed 
by coupling  this system  with the Webcam security 
system [see ref.]. 
 
 

2. THE  BLOCK  SCHEME 

 

The security  system presented in  fig. 1  is  made  up 
of the central unit, the input block, the output block, 
the  detection  system  for  the  intruder,  the  warning 

the  peripherical 

the  supervised  circuit  of 

block, the serial interface,  the distance information 
transmitting block and the supply block. 
 
 
2.1. The central unit 
 
The  central  unit  is  made  up  of  the  microcontroller 
AT89C52, 
selection  block 
GAL22V10,  the  parallel  input  port  on  8  bits 
MM74HCT541,  the  parallel  output  port  on  8  bits 
MM74HCT574, 
the 
microcontroller ADM 691, the ROM serial memory 
and the configuration switch with 8 channels. 
 
 
2.2. The input and output blocks 
 
The input and output blocks, shown in fig. 2 and 3, 
are formed by the integrated optocouplors LTV844 
and  they  have  the  role  to  realize  the  galvanic 
isolation between the central unit, on one hand and 
the sensors, respectively the sections of the warning 
block  on the other hand 
 
In fig. 4 and 5 a detail for each of the two blocks is 
presented.

2.3. The intruder detection block 
 
The  intruder  detection  block  is  made  up  of  eight 
movement sensors or any type of sensors on  

 
 
condition that these could give the 0 output logical 
level when they are activated. 
 
 
2.4. The warning block  
 
The  warning  block  is  formed  by  eight  sections 
which,  when  they  are  activated,  can  generate 
acustic  and  light  signals,  can  shut  off  doors,  start 
engines, flood spaces, a.s.o. 
 
 
2.5. The serial interface 
 
The serial interface RS232 permits a baudrate up to 
200KB/s and realizes the bidirectional link with the 
GSM modem. 
 
 
2.6. The distance information transmitting block 
 
The  distance  information  transmitting  block  is 
made  up  of  a  GSM  modem  from  Telit  GM682-
PCS/_GPRS/_GSM  family,  endowed  with  a  SIM 
card and a mobile phone. 
 
The  transmission  between  the  two  modules  takes 
place through some bidirectional SMS-s. 

2.7. The supply block 
 
The  supply  block  has  three  stabilized  voltage 
sources,  two  of  12V  and  one  of  5V,  realized  with 
the  three  terminal  integrated  circuits  LM7812  and 
LM7805. 
 
 

3. THE  MICROCONTROLLER  

PROGRAMMING 

 
The  modem  initialization  routine,  fig.  6,  contains 
the following controls: 

1. AT <cr> - modem activation 

OK is waited for. 

2. AT + IPR = 9600- baudrate selection 

OK is waited for. 

3. AT + CMEE = 1 – error message activation 

OK is waited for. 

4. AT + CMGF = 1 <cr> - “text” type selection  

for SMS-s 

OK is waited for. 

5. AT + CMGS = “user’s phone number ” 

 – send SMS. 

The prompter “>” is waited for, after  

which the  SMS is written.

Finally, it is sent the CTRL – Z and  
the message is waited for AT + CMGS :  
<the number of the message> OK 
 

If  after  any  of  the  AT  controls  it  is  not  confirmed 
the  correct  receiving  of  the  control,  this  one  is 
repeated.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 
The  presented  system  is  an  attempt  to  use  the 
mobile phone in industrial field.  
 
The  transition  from  this  security  system  to  any 
other  type  of  system  with  distance  supervision  and 
control, represents a minor application.
