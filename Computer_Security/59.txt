Many types of RFID exist, but at the highest level, we can divide RFID devices into two classes: active 
and passive. Active tags require a power source they’re either connected to a powered infrastructure or use 
energy stored in an integrated battery. In the latter case, a tag’s lifetime is limited by the stored energy, 
balanced against the number of read operations the device must undergo. One example of an active tag is 
the transponder attached to an aircraft that identifies its national origin. Another example is a Low jack 
device  attached  to  a  car,  which  incorporates  cellular  technology  and  a  GPS  to  locate  the  car  if  stolen. 
However, batteries make the cost, size, and life-time of active tags impractical for the retail trade. Passive 
RFID is of interest because the tags don’t require batteries or maintenance. The tags also have an indefinite 
operational life and are small enough to fit into a practical adhesive label. A passive tag consists of three 
parts: an antenna, a semiconductor chip attached to the antenna, and some form of encapsulation. The tag 
reader is responsible for powering and communicating with a tag. The tag antenna captures energy and 
transfers  the  tag’s  ID  (the  tag’s  chip  coordinates  this  process).  The  encapsulation  maintains  the  tag’s 
integrity and protects the antenna and chip from environmental conditions or reagents.  
Encapsulation could be a small glass vial or a laminar plastic substrate with adhesive on one side to enable 
easy  attachment  to  goods.  Two  fundamentally  different  RFID  design  approaches  exist  for  transferring 
power from the reader to the tag: magnetic induction and electromagnetic (EM) wave capture. These two 
designs take advantage of the EM properties associated with an RF antenna—the near field and the far 
field. Both can transfer enough power to a remote tag to sustain its operation—typically between 10 W and 
1  mW,  depending  on  the  tag  type.  (For  comparison,  the  nominal  power  an  Intel  X  Scale  processor 
consumes  is  approximately  500  mW,  and  an  Intel  Pentium  4  consumes  up  to  50  W.)  Through  various 
modulation techniques, near- and far-field-based signals can also transmit and receive data.

GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications)  is  world's  most  famous  Mobile  platform.  Mobile 
phones  with  SIM  cards  use  GSM  technology  to  help  you  communicate  with  your  family,  friends  and 
business associates. 

Interfacing  of  GSM  unit  is  done  through  a  serial  communication  link  with  microcontroller  89E516RD. 
Whatever data is to be sent to GSM unit is done through this RS 232 link. Level translator translates TTL 
voltage level to RS-232 compatible level. It is realized with MAX 232. 

GSM systems have following advantages over basic land line telephony systems: 

1)  Mobility 
2)  Easy availability

However, batteries make the cost, size, and life-time of active tags impractical for the retail trade. Passive 
RFID is of interest because the tags don’t require batteries or maintenance. The tags also have an indefinite 
operational life and are small enough to fit into a practical adhesive label. A passive tag consists of three 
parts: an antenna, a semiconductor chip attached to the antenna, and some form of encapsulation. The tag 
reader is responsible for powering and communicating with a tag. The tag antenna captures energy and 
transfers  the  tag’s  ID  (the  tag’s  chip  coordinates  this  process).  The  encapsulation  maintains  the  tag’s 
integrity and protects the antenna and chip from environmental conditions or reagents.  
Encapsulation could be a small glass vial or a laminar plastic substrate with adhesive on one side to enable 
easy  attachment  to  goods.  Two  fundamentally  different  RFID  design  approaches  exist  for  transferring 
power from the reader to the tag: magnetic induction and electromagnetic (EM) wave capture. These two 
designs take advantage of the EM properties associated with an RF antenna—the near field and the far 
field. Both can transfer enough power to a remote tag to sustain its operation—typically between 10 W and 
1  mW,  depending  on  the  tag  type.  (For  comparison,  the  nominal  power  an  Intel  X  Scale  processor 
consumes  is  approximately  500  mW,  and  an  Intel  Pentium  4  consumes  up  to  50  W.)  Through  various 
modulation techniques, near- and far-field-based signals can also transmit and receive data.

GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications)  is  world's  most  famous  Mobile  platform.  Mobile 
phones  with  SIM  cards  use  GSM  technology  to  help  you  communicate  with  your  family,  friends  and 
business associates. 

Interfacing  of  GSM  unit  is  done  through  a  serial  communication  link  with  microcontroller  89E516RD. 
Whatever data is to be sent to GSM unit is done through this RS 232 link. Level translator translates TTL 
voltage level to RS-232 compatible level. It is realized with MAX 232. 

GSM systems have following advantages over basic land line telephony systems: 

1)  Mobility 
2)  Easy availability

transactions from central servers. The main benefit is that central server can be anywhere in the world. 
3. Supply Chain Management: With a central server in your head office with GSM capability, you can 
receive instant transaction data from all your branch offices, warehouses and business associates with nil 
downtime and low cost.

Fig. 5Power Supply Circuit 

 

There are two types of transformer namely Step up and Step Down. We have used Step down transformer 
as we have to generate 5 VDC supply from the 230 V input AC supply Transformer selection we required 
12V for relay. Min Input for 7805 is8 V. So at Input of 7805 we required 8 V with margin consider drop 
across diode 0.7V so 2 diode conducts drop is 1.4 V. So at secondary we required 10 V 
 
Rectifier is used to rectify the negative half cycles of the output signal of the secondary of the transformer. 
So at the input of the rectifier we have AC signal with both positive and negative cycles and at the output 
of the rectifier we have signal with only positive cycles but as this signal is pulsating DC we have to use 
capacitor  to  filter  out  the  AC  contents  of  the  output  signal.  There  are  mainly  three  types  of  rectifiers 
namely half wave, Full wave and Bridge rectifier. Out of these three we have used Bridge rectifier since it 
give more efficiency.  
Filter capacitor is used to remove the AC signal from the output of rectifier. Voltage drop across IC and 
diode is 4.5V.So dc voltage must be 8V.

ABSTRACT	
This  paper represents  the  RFID and  GSM  technology.  The  main  objective  of the system  is  to uniquely 
identify  and to  make  security  for a  person.  This  requires  a  unique product, which  has  the  capability of 
distinguishing different person. This is possible by the new emerging technology RFID (Radio Frequency 
Identification). The main parts of an RFID system are RFID tag (with unique ID number) and RFID reader 
(for reading the RFID tag). In this system, RFID tag and RFID reader used are operating at 125 KHz. The 
microcontroller internal memory is used for storing the details.

INTRODUCTION	

Most  educational  institutions'  administrators  are  concerned  about  campus  security.  The  conventional 
method allowing access to employee inside an educational campus is by showing photo I-cards to security 
guard  is  very  time  consuming  and  insecure,  hence  inefficient.  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID) 
based security system is one of the solutions to address this problem. This system can be used to allow 
access for student in school, college, and university. It also can be used to take attendance for workers in 
working  places.  Its  ability  to  uniquely  identify  each  person  based  on  .security  access  easier,  faster  and 
secure as compared to conventional method. Students or workers only need to place their ID card on the 
reader and they will be allowed to enter the campus. And if any invalid card is shown then the buzzer is 
turned on. 
WORKING	OF	THE	SYSTEM	
Initially the power is on and the microcontroller will start, it sends the request to LCD display ‘POWER IS 
ON’ that is initializing message. When the RFID tags, coming in the range of RFID reader then the tag 
generates  its  unique  hex  code  that  hex  code  is  read  the  reader  and  sends  message  towards  the 
microcontroller. Microcontroller checking that tag code. Whether the tag hex code is matching any code 
which has stored in the microcontroller, then the microcontroller sends the request to DC motor to start 
and at the same time microcontroller sends the message to LCD display ‘THIS IS VALID ENTRY’ and 
this employees whole detail in the LCD display, and the motor will start to open the door and close the 
motor to welcome the employee and through GSM sends the message whether this is same person who 
stored in previous storing data. If any other tag is coming in the range of RFID reader then it is a fake 
account,  then  reader  can  read  that  different  code  and  sends  message  ‘ALLERT  THIS  IS  INVALID 
ENTRY’ and motor will not start at the same time the buzzer will start and the guard is come there and 
check the person is theft or any other and remove from the campus.

Many types of RFID exist, but at the highest level, we can divide RFID devices into two classes: active 
and passive. Active tags require a power source they’re either connected to a powered infrastructure or use 
energy stored in an integrated battery. In the latter case, a tag’s lifetime is limited by the stored energy, 
balanced against the number of read operations the device must undergo. One example of an active tag is 
the transponder attached to an aircraft that identifies its national origin. Another example is a Low jack 
device  attached  to  a  car,  which  incorporates  cellular  technology  and  a  GPS  to  locate  the  car  if  stolen. 
However, batteries make the cost, size, and life-time of active tags impractical for the retail trade. Passive

Voltage regulator is used after the filter capacitor so as to generate constant DC voltage supply of 5 volts. 
We  have  used  IC  7805  as  a  voltage  regulator  it  is  a  three  pin  IC  which  are  namely  input,  ground  and 
output. The regulator has a finger voltage of 3 volts. Hence voltage required at input of regulator is 8 volt.

CONCLUSION	

So it can be conclude that by design the intelligent campus security tracking system based on RFID and 
GSM system which has full range of protection on campus, the security can be improved. The intelligent 
campus security tracking system is based on wireless communication services between nodes provided by 
RFID sensors and identifies the RFID tags within the region to prevent thefts and track the valuables, so as 
to protect the property of the campus.

modulation techniques, near- and far-field-based signals can also transmit and receive data.

GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications)  is  world's  most  famous  Mobile  platform.  Mobile 
phones  with  SIM  cards  use  GSM  technology  to  help  you  communicate  with  your  family,  friends  and 
business associates. 

Interfacing  of  GSM  unit  is  done  through  a  serial  communication  link  with  microcontroller  89E516RD. 
Whatever data is to be sent to GSM unit is done through this RS 232 link. Level translator translates TTL 
voltage level to RS-232 compatible level. It is realized with MAX 232. 

GSM systems have following advantages over basic land line telephony systems: 

1)  Mobility 
2)  Easy availability

3)  High up time                                                                                                                                                      

we use communication feature of Telephone landlines for internet, e-mail, data connectivity, 
remote monitoring, computer to computer communication, security systems. 

In the same way we can use GSM technology and benefit from its advantages. 

 

Uses GSM technology for following applications: 
1.  Access  control  devices:  Access  control  devices  can  communicate  with  servers  and  security  staff 
through  SMS  messaging.  Complete  log  of  transaction  is  available  at  the  head-office  Server  instantly 
without any wiring involved and device can instantly alert security personnel on their mobile phone in case 
of any problem. 
2. Transaction terminals: EDC (Electronic Data Capturing) machines can use SMS messaging to confirm 
transactions from central servers. The main benefit is that central server can be anywhere in the world. 
3. Supply Chain Management: With a central server in your head office with GSM capability, you can 
receive instant transaction data from all your branch offices, warehouses and business associates with nil 
downtime and low cost. 
SYSTEM	DESIGN	

Fig. 5Power Supply Circuit 

 

There are two types of transformer namely Step up and Step Down. We have used Step down transformer 
as we have to generate 5 VDC supply from the 230 V input AC supply Transformer selection we required 
12V for relay. Min Input for 7805 is8 V. So at Input of 7805 we required 8 V with margin consider drop 
across diode 0.7V so 2 diode conducts drop is 1.4 V. So at secondary we required 10 V 
 
Rectifier is used to rectify the negative half cycles of the output signal of the secondary of the transformer. 
So at the input of the rectifier we have AC signal with both positive and negative cycles and at the output 
of the rectifier we have signal with only positive cycles but as this signal is pulsating DC we have to use 
capacitor  to  filter  out  the  AC  contents  of  the  output  signal.  There  are  mainly  three  types  of  rectifiers 
namely half wave, Full wave and Bridge rectifier. Out of these three we have used Bridge rectifier since it 
give more efficiency.  
Filter capacitor is used to remove the AC signal from the output of rectifier. Voltage drop across IC and 
diode is 4.5V.So dc voltage must be 8V.

Voltage regulator is used after the filter capacitor so as to generate constant DC voltage supply of 5 volts. 
We  have  used  IC  7805  as  a  voltage  regulator  it  is  a  three  pin  IC  which  are  namely  input,  ground  and 
output. The regulator has a finger voltage of 3 volts. Hence voltage required at input of regulator is 8 volt.
