ABSTRACT: Insecurity is not a credit to any responsible society, and the conventional use of watch-man has 
drawbacks  of  huge  risk  of  life  and  cost  intensive.  The  use  home  security  system  with  user  programmable  text 
alert GSM mobile phone number with unique PIN to allow universal users with human body motion detective 
can  overcome  these  limitations.  This  paper  presents  reliable  security  system  that  is  able  to  recognize  human 
body motion and send an alert message to inform the owner(at any location in the world where there is GSM 
mobile network coverage) of the house through an SMS alert when an unwanted visitor or thief enters the range 
of  the  sensor.  The  system  design  is  in  three  main  phases:  the  sensitivity,  central  processing  and  action.  The 
sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted at watch-area, central processing 
is  performed  by  a  programmed  microcontroller,  and  the  action  (task)  is  done  through  an  interaction  of  an 
attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  send an SMS alert to the user 
or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part of human) body motion.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then

of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

2.3    GSM Module 
 
GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile 
internet  connectivity,  most  of them  can  also  be  used  for  sending  and  receiving SMS  and  MMS  messages.  This 
device can also receive and process GSM signals from virtually all GSM bands.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house

serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending

The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

The  system  allows  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  to  a  house  owner  regarding  its  security.  The  need  to 
employ  a  „watchman‟  to  guard  a  house  is  eliminated  with  the  use  of  our  system.  The  proposed  approach  for 
designing this system is to implement a microcontroller-based GSM module that sends notification from a GSM

   1.3   Limitations of the Project 

The system has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below;   

[1]  The  receiver  must  be  located  in  in  a  location  where  a  signal  with  sufficient  strength  can  be 

received from the GSM module.   

[2]  Operation  of  the  SIM  card  in  the  GSM  module  when  sending  SMS  is  only  achievable  with  the 

accessibility of credit on it.  

[3]  The GSM module users have to recharge the SIM card by removing it, via ATM or online. 

 

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  
send an SMS alert to the user or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part 
of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

In  the  Passive  system  each  sensor  consists  of  two  housings.  The  first  housing  contains  an  infrared-
emitting diode and an infrared-sensitive phototransistor as the infrared detector. The other housing contains  an 
infrared reflector to reflect the infrared signal [7]. When positioned in front of an entrance to a protected area, 
the two housings establish an invisible beam.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

2.3    GSM Module 
 
GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile 
internet  connectivity,  most  of them  can  also  be  used  for  sending  and  receiving SMS  and  MMS  messages.  This 
device can also receive and process GSM signals from virtually all GSM bands.

ABSTRACT: Insecurity is not a credit to any responsible society, and the conventional use of watch-man has 
drawbacks  of  huge  risk  of  life  and  cost  intensive.  The  use  home  security  system  with  user  programmable  text

can  overcome  these  limitations.  This  paper  presents  reliable  security  system  that  is  able  to  recognize  human 
body motion and send an alert message to inform the owner(at any location in the world where there is GSM 
mobile network coverage) of the house through an SMS alert when an unwanted visitor or thief enters the range 
of  the  sensor.  The  system  design  is  in  three  main  phases:  the  sensitivity,  central  processing  and  action.  The

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

The  system  allows  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  to  a  house  owner  regarding  its  security.  The  need  to 
employ  a  „watchman‟  to  guard  a  house  is  eliminated  with  the  use  of  our  system.  The  proposed  approach  for 
designing this system is to implement a microcontroller-based GSM module that sends notification from a GSM 
module over the GSM network to the user about the presence of an intruder in the house. The microcontroller 
then will carry out the issued commands and then communicate the status of an intruder.

   1.3   Limitations of the Project 

The system has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below;   

[1]  The  receiver  must  be  located  in  in  a  location  where  a  signal  with  sufficient  strength  can  be 

received from the GSM module.   

[2]  Operation  of  the  SIM  card  in  the  GSM  module  when  sending  SMS  is  only  achievable  with  the 

accessibility of credit on it.  

[3]  The GSM module users have to recharge the SIM card by removing it, via ATM or online. 

 

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  
send an SMS alert to the user or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part 
of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile

Mechanical motion detection devices can be simple to implement, but at the same time, it can be defeated easily 
by interrupting the devices mechanics like “cutting the wire”. 

2.4   Short Message Service to Reprogrammed Alert Phone Number 
 
SMS  stands  for  Short  Message  Service.  It  is  a  technology  that  enables  the  sending  and  receiving  of 
message  between  mobile  phones.  It  was  included  in  the  GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communication) 
standards right at the beginning. The reprogramming is done through the line 8 to 10 of the system processor 
algorithm in section 3.2 of this paper. 

2.5   Technology Considerations     

The  considerations  for  this  system  will  include  a  choice  of  networks,  communication  protocols  and 
interfaces. Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM receiver and the microcontroller. 
The  proposed  system  is  designed  to  detect  motion  of  either  authorized  or  non-authorized  persons  around  a 
house. The system is designed with a GSM module, The GSM module system uses mobile network and is battery 
powered which makes home automation system safer from internet hacks.  

In an attempt to implement the proposed system, it was divided into two parts which includes:

ABSTRACT: Insecurity is not a credit to any responsible society, and the conventional use of watch-man has 
drawbacks  of  huge  risk  of  life  and  cost  intensive.  The  use  home  security  system  with  user  programmable  text 
alert GSM mobile phone number with unique PIN to allow universal users with human body motion detective 
can  overcome  these  limitations.  This  paper  presents  reliable  security  system  that  is  able  to  recognize  human 
body motion and send an alert message to inform the owner(at any location in the world where there is GSM 
mobile network coverage) of the house through an SMS alert when an unwanted visitor or thief enters the range 
of  the  sensor.  The  system  design  is  in  three  main  phases:  the  sensitivity,  central  processing  and  action.  The 
sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted at watch-area, central processing 
is  performed  by  a  programmed  microcontroller,  and  the  action  (task)  is  done  through  an  interaction  of  an 
attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  send an SMS alert to the user 
or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part of human) body motion.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

The  system  allows  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  to  a  house  owner  regarding  its  security.  The  need  to 
employ  a  „watchman‟  to  guard  a  house  is  eliminated  with  the  use  of  our  system.  The  proposed  approach  for 
designing this system is to implement a microcontroller-based GSM module that sends notification from a GSM 
module over the GSM network to the user about the presence of an intruder in the house. The microcontroller 
then will carry out the issued commands and then communicate the status of an intruder.

   1.2   Aims and Intended Users 

 This work was highlighted into three main objectives as follows:   

I.  Develop a system that is capable to identify intruder and send   information to user regarding a  
    break- in at their resident. 

            II. The necessities of the home security system should have low cost, easy installation, fast response,  
                and low power consumption and a better way of security. 

                  III. To improve home security systems and eliminate the need of watchman to guard a house. 
 
sensor that can be used to detect the presence of an intruder. This guarantees safety to the user. 

This  system  is  aimed  toward  all  the  average  users  who  wish  to  secure  their  household/office  with  a 

   1.3   Limitations of the Project 

The system has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below;   

[1]  The  receiver  must  be  located  in  in  a  location  where  a  signal  with  sufficient  strength  can  be 

received from the GSM module.   

[2]  Operation  of  the  SIM  card  in  the  GSM  module  when  sending  SMS  is  only  achievable  with  the 

accessibility of credit on it.  

[3]  The GSM module users have to recharge the SIM card by removing it, via ATM or online. 

 

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  
send an SMS alert to the user or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part 
of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

Figure 1: Block Diagram Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit 

In  the  Passive  system  each  sensor  consists  of  two  housings.  The  first  housing  contains  an  infrared-
emitting diode and an infrared-sensitive phototransistor as the infrared detector. The other housing contains  an 
infrared reflector to reflect the infrared signal [7]. When positioned in front of an entrance to a protected area, 
the two housings establish an invisible beam.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.   
          

         INFRARED TRANSMITTER              INFRARED DETECTOR/                     LAMP INDICATOR

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile

ABSTRACT: Insecurity is not a credit to any responsible society, and the conventional use of watch-man has 
drawbacks  of  huge  risk  of  life  and  cost  intensive.  The  use  home  security  system  with  user  programmable  text 
alert GSM mobile phone number with unique PIN to allow universal users with human body motion detective 
can  overcome  these  limitations.  This  paper  presents  reliable  security  system  that  is  able  to  recognize  human 
body motion and send an alert message to inform the owner(at any location in the world where there is GSM 
mobile network coverage) of the house through an SMS alert when an unwanted visitor or thief enters the range 
of  the  sensor.  The  system  design  is  in  three  main  phases:  the  sensitivity,  central  processing  and  action.  The 
sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted at watch-area, central processing 
is  performed  by  a  programmed  microcontroller,  and  the  action  (task)  is  done  through  an  interaction  of  an 
attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  send an SMS alert to the user 
or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part of human) body motion.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

The  system  allows  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  to  a  house  owner  regarding  its  security.  The  need  to 
employ  a  „watchman‟  to  guard  a  house  is  eliminated  with  the  use  of  our  system.  The  proposed  approach  for 
designing this system is to implement a microcontroller-based GSM module that sends notification from a GSM 
module over the GSM network to the user about the presence of an intruder in the house. The microcontroller 
then will carry out the issued commands and then communicate the status of an intruder.

   1.2   Aims and Intended Users 

 This work was highlighted into three main objectives as follows:   

I.  Develop a system that is capable to identify intruder and send   information to user regarding a  
    break- in at their resident. 

            II. The necessities of the home security system should have low cost, easy installation, fast response,  
                and low power consumption and a better way of security. 

                  III. To improve home security systems and eliminate the need of watchman to guard a house. 
 
sensor that can be used to detect the presence of an intruder. This guarantees safety to the user. 

This  system  is  aimed  toward  all  the  average  users  who  wish  to  secure  their  household/office  with  a 

   1.3   Limitations of the Project 

The system has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below;   

[1]  The  receiver  must  be  located  in  in  a  location  where  a  signal  with  sufficient  strength  can  be 

received from the GSM module.   

[2]  Operation  of  the  SIM  card  in  the  GSM  module  when  sending  SMS  is  only  achievable  with  the 

accessibility of credit on it.  

[3]  The GSM module users have to recharge the SIM card by removing it, via ATM or online. 

 

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  
send an SMS alert to the user or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part 
of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

Figure 1: Block Diagram Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit 

In  the  Passive  system  each  sensor  consists  of  two  housings.  The  first  housing  contains  an  infrared-
emitting diode and an infrared-sensitive phototransistor as the infrared detector. The other housing contains  an 
infrared reflector to reflect the infrared signal [7]. When positioned in front of an entrance to a protected area, 
the two housings establish an invisible beam.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

2.3    GSM Module 
 
GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile 
internet  connectivity,  most  of them  can  also  be  used  for  sending  and  receiving SMS  and  MMS  messages.  This 
device can also receive and process GSM signals from virtually all GSM bands.

GSM  module  will  then  send  Message  to  the  user  and  also  receive  instruction  from  the  user  cell  phone  for 
reprogramming the phone number.  

Figure 6: GSM module 

 

Mechanical motion detection devices can be simple to implement, but at the same time, it can be defeated easily 
by interrupting the devices mechanics like “cutting the wire”. 

2.4   Short Message Service to Reprogrammed Alert Phone Number 
 
SMS  stands  for  Short  Message  Service.  It  is  a  technology  that  enables  the  sending  and  receiving  of 
message  between  mobile  phones.  It  was  included  in  the  GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communication) 
standards right at the beginning. The reprogramming is done through the line 8 to 10 of the system processor 
algorithm in section 3.2 of this paper. 

2.5   Technology Considerations     

The  considerations  for  this  system  will  include  a  choice  of  networks,  communication  protocols  and 
interfaces. Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM receiver and the microcontroller. 
The  proposed  system  is  designed  to  detect  motion  of  either  authorized  or  non-authorized  persons  around  a 
house. The system is designed with a GSM module, The GSM module system uses mobile network and is battery 
powered which makes home automation system safer from internet hacks.  

In an attempt to implement the proposed system, it was divided into two parts which includes:

Motion sensors are used in a motion detector which is a device that contains a physical mechanism or 
 
electronic  sensor  that  quantifies  motion  that  can  be  either  integrated  with  or  connected  to  other  devices  that 
alert  the  user  of  the  presence  of  a  moving  object  within  the  field  of  view.  They  form  a  vital  component  of 
comprehensive security systems. The Motion sensors cannot detect still objects.

purpose as well. So this system can also be used in industries as a GSM based industrial security system. 

 

5.3   Commercial Use 

We can use this project in banks as well as other business organizations, since it has a sensor detector 
to  detect  any  misconduct  of  persons.  And,  most  importantly  it‟s  alert  mobile  phone  number  was  flexible  to 
change with a PIN. 

 

5.4    Remote indication 
With the use of GSM technology owner of the house or industry get remote indication through SMS. So 
 
even  if  the  user  is  away  from  home  or  industry,  he/she  will  be  informed  of  the  presence  of  anyone  within  the 
house. 

5.5      Automation Use 

The system is fully automated. So once this system is installed inside home or industry, then it does not 

require any human interaction to operate.  

VI.   FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 

The  future  implications  of  the  project  are  very  great  considering  the  amount  of  time  and  resources  it 
 
saves.  This system can be used as a reference or as a base for realizing a scheme to be implemented in other 
projects of greater level including audio-visual camera by sending the captured image to an e-mail instantly..   
The  project  itself  can  be  modified  to  achieve  a  complete  Home  Automation  System  which  will  then  create  a 
platform for the user to interface between himself and his household.  

 
The practical application of this developed system is immense with vast level of implementation.  The 
model can be used in places such as banks, office and many other related places where continuous monitoring 
and regulation is needed.

ABSTRACT: Insecurity is not a credit to any responsible society, and the conventional use of watch-man has 
drawbacks  of  huge  risk  of  life  and  cost  intensive.  The  use  home  security  system  with  user  programmable  text 
alert GSM mobile phone number with unique PIN to allow universal users with human body motion detective 
can  overcome  these  limitations.  This  paper  presents  reliable  security  system  that  is  able  to  recognize  human 
body motion and send an alert message to inform the owner(at any location in the world where there is GSM 
mobile network coverage) of the house through an SMS alert when an unwanted visitor or thief enters the range 
of  the  sensor.  The  system  design  is  in  three  main  phases:  the  sensitivity,  central  processing  and  action.  The 
sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted at watch-area, central processing 
is  performed  by  a  programmed  microcontroller,  and  the  action  (task)  is  done  through  an  interaction  of  an 
attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  send an SMS alert to the user 
or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part of human) body motion.

INTRODUCTION 

A high level of theft or insecurity calls for better security system. It is much safer to have a system that 
monitors and communicates to the device owner without putting human life to risk in the name of “Watchman”.  
This insecurity has paved way to increasing rate of stealing packed cars, money and valuable things in the home 
even with security. In order to enhance an improved and life risk free security system, the purpose of this study 
is to aid a better security system of house with the use of GSM. This system monitors one‟s home against theft 
and  has  a  text  message  sent  to  the  house  owner,  telling  him  that  there  is  an  unauthorized  person  close  to  the 
house. The system will also notice what is happening around the building. With this home security system, the 
house is always protected. The total absence of sufficient security personnel in a house is a great discomfort to 
house owners.  
 
This project has three basic modules along with a GSM module. GSM module is used to send the SMS 
whenever there are changes in any of the three modules. First module of this project detects the incidence of an 
intruder. This feature is helpful at night time or whenever we are out of our home. LED placed outside the house 
displays  this  status. And  if  person  comes  closer  the  more  then  the  LED  is  turned  on.  Second  part  of  project 
serves the functionality of the GSM network that quickly alerts the owner of the house through a sms  sending 
this data to a GSM modem through serial port.  
 
The  new  age  of  technology  has  redefined  communication.  Most  people  nowadays  have  access  to 
mobile  phones  and  thus  the  world  indeed  has  become  a  global  village. At  any  given  moment,  any  particular 
individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted 
to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further 
enhance  its  capabilities.  Technologies  such  as  Infra-red[1,2],  Bluetooth[3],  and  Global  system  for  Mobile 
Communication[4]  to  mention  a  few,  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  to  show  the  very  fact  that 
improvements are in fact possible and these improvement have eased our life and the standard of living.

The  system  allows  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  to  a  house  owner  regarding  its  security.  The  need  to 
employ  a  „watchman‟  to  guard  a  house  is  eliminated  with  the  use  of  our  system.  The  proposed  approach  for 
designing this system is to implement a microcontroller-based GSM module that sends notification from a GSM 
module over the GSM network to the user about the presence of an intruder in the house. The microcontroller 
then will carry out the issued commands and then communicate the status of an intruder.

   1.2   Aims and Intended Users 

 This work was highlighted into three main objectives as follows:   

I.  Develop a system that is capable to identify intruder and send   information to user regarding a  
    break- in at their resident. 

            II. The necessities of the home security system should have low cost, easy installation, fast response,  
                and low power consumption and a better way of security. 

                  III. To improve home security systems and eliminate the need of watchman to guard a house. 
 
sensor that can be used to detect the presence of an intruder. This guarantees safety to the user. 

This  system  is  aimed  toward  all  the  average  users  who  wish  to  secure  their  household/office  with  a 

   1.3   Limitations of the Project 

The system has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below;   

[1]  The  receiver  must  be  located  in  in  a  location  where  a  signal  with  sufficient  strength  can  be 

received from the GSM module.   

[2]  Operation  of  the  SIM  card  in  the  GSM  module  when  sending  SMS  is  only  achievable  with  the 

accessibility of credit on it.  

[3]  The GSM module users have to recharge the SIM card by removing it, via ATM or online. 

 

II.  TECHNOLOGY USED 

 
The proposed system is concerned with the design and construction of  a  Home Security System with 
User Programmable Text Alert GSM Mobile Phone Number, Unique PIN to Allow Universal Users and Human 
Body Motion Detective through PIR Sensor system. The system design is in three main phases: the sensitivity, 
central processing and action. The sensitivity is the perception section that is done through PIR sensor mounted 
at  watch-area, central processing is performed by a programmed  microcontroller, and the action (task) is done 
through an interaction of an attached on-board GSM module to the processor (the microcontroller) which then  
send an SMS alert to the user or owner mobile phone number.  This system is design to only detect only (or part 
of human) body motion. 
 

2.1    The Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit  
 
A  motion  detector  is  contains  a  motion  sensor  and  is  either incorporated  with  or  connected   to  
other    devices    that    alert    the    user    of    the    pre-sense    of    body  motion.   An    electronic    motion    detector  
contains  a  motion  sensor  that  transforms  the detection of motion into an electric signal. The electric signal 
can be connected to a burglar with lamp system which is used to alert the home owner or security service after it 
detects motion.

Figure 1: Block Diagram Motion Discernment (Detector) Circuit 

In  the  Passive  system  each  sensor  consists  of  two  housings.  The  first  housing  contains  an  infrared-
emitting diode and an infrared-sensitive phototransistor as the infrared detector. The other housing contains  an 
infrared reflector to reflect the infrared signal [7]. When positioned in front of an entrance to a protected area, 
the two housings establish an invisible beam.

The  infrared  motion  detector  circuit  is  based  on  two  basic principles  of  passive infrared  motion  detector  
which  are  the  infrared  transmitter  and infrared receiver as shown in Figure.3.  

 

Infrared transmitter 
 
For the infrared transmitter which is also known as emitter circuit, it is on a basic design of timer 555 
astable operation. This means that the 555 timer can operate repeatedly; it will switch „on‟ and „off ‟ continually 
to generate data for the infrared transmission 
 
Infrared receiver  
 
The  infrared  receiver  which  is  also  known  as  infrared  detector  receives  the data  transmitted  by  
the  infrared  transmitter  circuit. This infrared detector can be directly  connected into the controller circuit to 
produce  logic  high  „1‟  or  low  „0‟  from  the  output  terminal  thus  activate  or  deactivate  the  controller  system 
operation.  The  range  of  infrared  detector  components  according  to    datasheet    stated    that    the    infrared  
detector  can  fully  operates  on  detecting  the infrared signal of 38 to 45 kHz.

2.2   The Microcontroller circuit 

The    controller    systems    that    use    to    control    the    motion    detector    system    and  other    electronic  
devices  are  the  microcontroller PIC16F1508 –  expended  mode.  In expended  mode  configuration,  external  
ROM  and  RAM  are used to  add  the  data memory to be more than internal memory provided by the Intel 
manufacture. The  purpose  of  using  an  expended  mode  for  the  project  is  to  expend  more data  available  
on  developing and  designing  an  excellent  operation  of  the  security system[8].

2.3    GSM Module 
 
GSM module, Figure 5, is a specialized type of modem which accepts SIM card, and operates over a 
subscription  to  mobile  operators.  When  the  GSM  modem  and  computer  are  interconnected,  there  is 
communication over the mobile network. Though these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile 
internet  connectivity,  most  of them  can  also  be  used  for  sending  and  receiving SMS  and  MMS  messages.  This 
device can also receive and process GSM signals from virtually all GSM bands.

reprogramming the phone number.  

Figure 6: GSM module 

 

Mechanical motion detection devices can be simple to implement, but at the same time, it can be defeated easily 
by interrupting the devices mechanics like “cutting the wire”. 

2.4   Short Message Service to Reprogrammed Alert Phone Number 
 
SMS  stands  for  Short  Message  Service.  It  is  a  technology  that  enables  the  sending  and  receiving  of 
message  between  mobile  phones.  It  was  included  in  the  GSM  (Global  System  for  Mobile  Communication) 
standards right at the beginning. The reprogramming is done through the line 8 to 10 of the system processor 
algorithm in section 3.2 of this paper. 

2.5   Technology Considerations     

The  considerations  for  this  system  will  include  a  choice  of  networks,  communication  protocols  and 
interfaces. Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM receiver and the microcontroller. 
The  proposed  system  is  designed  to  detect  motion  of  either  authorized  or  non-authorized  persons  around  a 
house. The system is designed with a GSM module, The GSM module system uses mobile network and is battery 
powered which makes home automation system safer from internet hacks.  

In an attempt to implement the proposed system, it was divided into two parts which includes:

veroboard implementation, testing and result and packaging. 

While  constructing  a  microcontroller  based  system,  it  basically  involves  design  and  validation, 

IV.   CONSTRUCTION 

4.1   DESIGN AND VALIDATION 

PIC12F1840, 8 bit, microcontroller was used to implement this work. In order for the microcontroller 
to be able to perform its function in the system, it was required to write code of program onto it. The MikroC 
was  selected  over  assembly  language based  on  its  advantages:    reusable,  Code  portability,  easy  to  write,  and 
High programmer efficiency. The program was run successfully.   

4.2    VEROBOARD IMPLEMENTATION 
 
After  proper  verification,  the  design  was  transferred  to  a  veroboard  for  permanent  construction.  The 
components were arranged and soldered on the veroboard such that each component can easily be identified. 
Before  proper  soldering,  component  layout  plan  was  drawn  paying  particular  attention  to  minimizing  the 
distances involved between point to be connected and the prevention of the overcrowding.  

Figure 15: Vero board Layout of the System 

 

4.3   TESTING AND RESULT 
 
It is of paramount importance to establish a highly efficient testing technique in other to minimize cost. 
The testing instrument used for examining logical signal, testing and troubleshooting application in the course 
of  this  project  were:  digital  multimeter,  logic  probe  and  oscilloscope.  Testing  involves  troubleshooting  the 
hardware  system  to  detect,  isolate  and  correct  internal  or  external  fault  such  as  malfunction  in  the  internal 
circuitry,  input  or  output  shorted  or  Vcc  input  or  output  open  circuited,  short  circuit  between  two  pins  broken 
wire, poor of dry connection, bent or broken pins, or an IC and faulty ICs socket.  

The hardware system  was properly tested because the software cannot work without the proper functioning of 
the hardware. The testing of the entire circuit was carried out in stages: 

i.  Each  of  the  components  was  first  tested  using  the  multimeter  in  order  to  check  for  their  state  of 

ii. 

performance and accurate values. 
In  the  connection,  each  component  on  the  veroboard  was  then  tested.  This  was  done  in  other  to 
carry  out  the  continuity,  which  is  meant  for  proper  connection  of  the  circuit  and  to  detect  any 
wrong connection. 

iii.  The sensory unit circuitry was tested to ascertain the degree of sensitivity.

change with a PIN. 

 

5.4    Remote indication 
With the use of GSM technology owner of the house or industry get remote indication through SMS. So 
 
even  if  the  user  is  away  from  home  or  industry,  he/she  will  be  informed  of  the  presence  of  anyone  within  the 
house. 

5.5      Automation Use 

The system is fully automated. So once this system is installed inside home or industry, then it does not 

require any human interaction to operate.  

VI.   FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 

The  future  implications  of  the  project  are  very  great  considering  the  amount  of  time  and  resources  it 
 
saves.  This system can be used as a reference or as a base for realizing a scheme to be implemented in other 
projects of greater level including audio-visual camera by sending the captured image to an e-mail instantly..   
The  project  itself  can  be  modified  to  achieve  a  complete  Home  Automation  System  which  will  then  create  a 
platform for the user to interface between himself and his household.  

 
The practical application of this developed system is immense with vast level of implementation.  The 
model can be used in places such as banks, office and many other related places where continuous monitoring 
and regulation is needed.  

VII.   CONCLUSION 

 
It  is  definitely  challenging  to  have  implemented  this  work  with  tremendous  applications  and 
possibilities; the realization of a full automation, a real time system may be engaged and a biometric scanner 
that will provide an apt monitoring and security purposes. This makes it feasible for users to have a respite that 
their belongings are protected. A more effective and sensitive sensor is recommended for better performance.
