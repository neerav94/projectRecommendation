Introduction  

      The aim of this work is to design the automated security system in order 
to detect, track and destroy the target for surveillance operations. The system 
can  be  operated  in  two  modes,  in  which  the  target  can  be  tracked 
automatically  by  using  microcontroller  based  system.  On  other  hand,  the 
system can also be controlled manually in which the user has right to select 
the  target  and  performs  shooting  if  necessary.  The  image  processing 
algorithms are  implemented in Matlab. The process starts by processing the 
video  signal  on  computer  by  using  the  video  camera,  then  the  target  is 
selected  which  can  be  tracked  further  by  using  different  image  processing 
techniques.  After  the  selection  of  target,  the  micro-controller  unit  takes  the 
decision  to  shoot  any  unauthorized  person  or  activity  within  its  range.  The 
gun is mounted on a tripod stand and its movement is controlled by using the 
stepper  motor.  Once  the  target  is  selected  it  can  be  tracked  by  moving  the 
camera and gun.

In  these  days  security  is  the  major  issue  for  all  over  the  world.  Security  is  very  important  in  order  to  protect 
vulnerable  and  valuable  assets  such  as  a  person,  dwelling,  community  and  nation  from  any  harm.  International 
security issues are also very important, especially border and coast security  to any country. The people of national 
security agencies, maritime security organization, military forces and other forces sacrifice their lives to protect their 
country people.  The  lives of  forces are  also very  precious  like other lives. So by using  advance technologies, the 
forces can protect their nation superiorly with minimum life losses. 
In  this  modern  era,  computer  base  security  equipments  are  very  popular  among  forces  because  they  are  more 
advance and safe for themselves. For example drone technology the “unmanned aerial vehicle” which is controlled 
automatically  by  computer  is  very  popular  these  days.  In  this  technology,  the  target  is  selected  and  hit  by  using 
computer based algorithms including image processing techniques.  
Real time image and video processing for object detection and tracking has many important applications in the field 
of computer vision (B. Coifman et al., 1998), such as video surveillance, military purposes etc. The availability of 
high quality and  inexpensive  video cameras  and the  increasing  need  for automated video analysis  has generated a 
great deal of  interest  in the areas of  motion detection,  object tracking and object targeted  (A. Yilmaz et al., 2006) 
Thus on a very high level, it is possible to identify three key steps in video analysis: detection of interesting moving 
objects,  tracking  of  the  detected objects  from  frame  to  frame,  and  analysis  of  the  object tracks  to  recognize  their 
behavior and targeted object accordingly. 
Another existing example of automatically aimed weapon is the sentry gun which aims and fires the targets which is 
selected  by  its  sensors  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_gun).    The  earliest  military  sentry  guns  were  used  in 
“Close-in  Weapon”  systems  in  which  the  target  is  detected  and  it  also  destroys  enemy  aircrafts  and  short  range 
incoming missiles (P. Croom et al., 2010). Another existing application is “Air Defense Gun” which is mounted on 
the device at the top of the army tank which automatically tracks and shoots low flying armored vehicles. 
Object detection with a camera is a revolution in  image processing which itself has applications in various civilian 
and military fields. These applications include air traffic control, navigation system, error tolerant systems, judgment 
problems, inspection, target analyze, command and control, sensor management and weapon assistance.

Our system is a combination of sentry guns and drone technology but the difference is that, it is used on earth and it 
is  implemented  by  gun  not  on  an  aircraft.  The  gun  that  automatically  aimed  and  fired  at  the  targets  which  are 
detected  by  using  image  processing  algorithms.  We  first  select  the  object,  and  then  the  gun  starts  the  tracking 
process according to the movement of camera. Once it aimed the tracked object then the gun fires automatically at 
targeted object. This operation can also be controlled manually.  
This  paper  focuses  mainly  on  the  problem  of  robust  foreground  segmentation  of  moving  objects.  This  paper  is 
organized  in  as  follow:  Section  2  describes  the  image  processing  techniques  and  section  3  describes  the  tracking 
system. 
 
System Model 
The work is divided into 4 parts. The first part is to process the video signal using Matlab in computer. The second 
part is to select the target. The third part consists of microcontroller based control unit which is used to control the 
stepper motor. Finally, the last part is to control the movement of gun. The overall block diagram of the proposed 
system is illustrated below. 

 

Processing of Video Signal 
The  first step is the processing of video signal  by using Matlab software.  The computer takes the video  from the 
camera,  process  the  video  signal  and  then  displays  its  contents  on  the  LCD  or  monitor.  The  digital  video  is  then 
converted  into  the  composite  video  format.  This  raw  digital  data  is  further  processed  to  produce  the  YCbCr 
(luminosity and chrominance) components of each frame. It is also introduced to change the pixels consequently to 
show it on VGA (Video Graphics Array).  The next part explains the procedure to select the target. 
 
Target Selection 
The target selection starts with the motion detection, which  is used as pre-processing algorithm in most of the object 
tracking  applications  (J.  S.  Lai  et  al.,  2008).  There  are  different  algorithms  used  for  motion  analysis  but  here  we 
used background subtraction to estimate the amount of motion in each frame. Background subtraction is conducted 
by using  background  estimation process  (A. Mittal  et al., 2004) which  starts with the grey  scaling and smoothing 
techniques in order to remove noise and improve sharpness. 

 

 
To  produce  delay  between  present  and  forthcoming  frames,  a  buffer  is  used  to  store  the  reference  image  for  30 
seconds. Meantime another image is captured from upcoming frame and both are subtracted with each other in order 
to estimate the background and foreground motions. The difference of both frames is a raw foreground image which 
is refined further. The raw foreground image is then converted from intensity image to binary format by applying the 
threshold  value.  By  performing  many  experiments  we  selected  the  threshold  value  as  „0.2‟,  which  means  that  in 
binary  image  if  the  value  is  greater  than  0.2,  it  will  be  treated  as  „1‟  otherwise  „0‟.  The  threshold  process  is 
explained in figure below.  

 

 
The threshold image after the background subtraction process is illustrated in figure 4. The foreground is represented 
by „1‟ white pixels and background as „0‟, black areas. 

 

 
The  binary  image  is  then  further  processed  by  using  morphological  operations.  The  morphological  operation  is  a 
process of image dilation and erosion techniques. The steps include the scanning of pixels from left to right direction 
and  analyzing  all  pixels  which  are  connected  with  foreground  and  background  orientations.  Those  pixels  whose 
neighbors  are  connected  with  foreground  are  considered  as  a  part  of  foreground  and  those  connected  with 
background  are  considered  as  background  pixels.  A  four  by  four  (3x3)  matrix  is  used  to  analyze  the  connected 
pixels. This 3x3 matrix is compared with each 3x3 pixels of the binary image. If the neighboring pixel is „1‟ then the 
other four pixels will also be treated as „1‟ and if the neighboring pixel is „0‟ then the corresponding four pixels will 
be considered as „0‟. The process of dilation and erosion is explained in figure 5 below. 
 

 

After  the  noise  removal  and  image  enhancement  by  using  dilation  and  erosion  processes  the  binary  image  from 
figure 4 is converted as in figure 6.

In order to differentiate the detected objects with each other, we labeled them as object „1‟ or object „2‟ by giving 
different values to them as explained in table below.  
 

 

Then we applied blob analysis to connect all part of the object by filling the empty spaces inside the object. A 4x4   
matrix of  „1s‟ is used as the blob factor which was put on the labeled matrix previously.  Then the neighbor of the 
foreground will be marked as „1‟ and the neighbor of background will be marked as „0‟ as shown in figure 8.  
 
After tracking the  location  and shape of the objects as discussed above, the  next step is to track the  movement of 
objects by using the micro-controller unit, which is explained in next section.  

 

 
Micro-Controller Unit 
The heart of the controlling unit is the PIC18F442 micro-controller. As explained in the above section, the location 
of  the  suspected  object  is  determined  by  the  image  processing  algorithm.  When  the  object  is  detected, the  micro-
controller performs two functions. First  is to activate the peripheral devices such as alarm,  hooter and spotlight to 
indicate the presence of the object. It is achieved by using relays. Secondly, to take the decision in order to control 
the movement of the gun, which is also achieved by using relays. The relays are connected to the micro-controller 
unit,  when  the  object  is  detected;  the  micro-controller  unit  sends  the  high  signal  to  the  relay  which  activates  the 
peripheral  devices.  To  control  the  movement  of  the  gun,  we  extracted  the  X  and  Y  co-ordinates  and  forward  it 
serially to the Matlab for further processing. Then the controller takes the decision according to the coordinates, how 
much the gun should rotate. The decision to shoot the object is also made by  the microcontroller. We also applied 
two  modes  of  controlling.  The  first  is  automated  control  mode  and  the  second  is  the  manual  control  mode.  In 
automated control mode, the system works automatically and it will take self-decision (either shoot the person who 
is detected or not). There is no need of any one to monitor or to supervise in this mode. The system is also trained in 
order to recognize the person. In automated mode, it will shoot only that person which has  an unauthorized entry to 
that  point.  Whereas,  in  manual  mode,  the  decision  to  shoot  will  be  taken  by  the  person  who  is  monitoring  the 
system. The next section explains the controlling of stepper motor to control the movement of the gun.  
 
Stepper Motor Controlling Gun 
After the detection of any unauthorized object, the gun starts tracking that object. The co-ordinates of the object are 
already  sent  to  the  computer  earlier  which  tracks  the  co-ordinates  of  the  target  and  send  the  new  location  to  the 
micro-controller unit. Then  the  micro-controller  unit controls the  movement of the gun through the stepper motor. 
To track the object, the gun is able to move in x-y plane which is achieved by mounting the gun on tripod stand. We 
used two stepper motors having the power rating  of 5.6 watts with the  step angle of 0.02 degree. One controls the 
movement of gun in horizontal direction and the other for vertical orientation. 
To  move  the  gun  to the  desired  position  on  the  x-y  plane,  the  current  position  of  the  gun  is  very  necessary  to  be 
known,  so  encoders  are  used  to  find  the  current  position  of  the  gun.  On  the  basis  of  the  current  position,  the 
microcontroller sends the information to the stepper motor about the position of the object. The main function of the 
motor is to rotate the gun according to the object. If object moves left side than motor moves anti-clock wise until 
the position of gun comes to centre of the detected object and  if object  moves right side than  motor moves clock 
wise until position of gun comes to centre of the detected object. 
 
Working of the System 
This  system  is  designed  to  track  the  suspected  object  in  real  time  and  provide  security  by  means  of  peripherals 
attached to this system. The working of the system consists of several steps which includes the processing of video 
signal from camera. The video is first converted into the raw digital format and then its luminance part is extracted 
by applying image processing algorithms. Then each frame is compared with the previous frame in order to detect 
the motion in the current frame. It is done by using background subtraction method. In this work, we applied scaling 
and  smoothing  techniques  to  remove  noise  and  to  improve  the  sharpness  of  the  image.  Then  we  calculated  the 
difference  image  by  subtracting  the  background  information.  Then  the  resultant  raw  binary  image  is  further 
processed  by  using  morphological  operations  which  results  in  the  detection  of  multiple  objects.  Then  we  applied 
blob  analysis  to  connect  all  parts  of  the  detected  image.  The  next  step  was  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the 
selected target which is achieved by sending the information to the micro-controller based system which compares 
the coordinates of the current frame with the previous one. Micro-controller then performs two functions; one is to 
activate the peripheral devices and the second is to take the decision in order to move the gun to the desired location.

Introduction  

      The aim of this work is to design the automated security system in order 
to detect, track and destroy the target for surveillance operations. The system 
can  be  operated  in  two  modes,  in  which  the  target  can  be  tracked 
automatically  by  using  microcontroller  based  system.  On  other  hand,  the 
system can also be controlled manually in which the user has right to select 
the  target  and  performs  shooting  if  necessary.  The  image  processing 
algorithms are  implemented in Matlab. The process starts by processing the 
video  signal  on  computer  by  using  the  video  camera,  then  the  target  is 
selected  which  can  be  tracked  further  by  using  different  image  processing 
techniques.  After  the  selection  of  target,  the  micro-controller  unit  takes  the 
decision  to  shoot  any  unauthorized  person  or  activity  within  its  range.  The 
gun is mounted on a tripod stand and its movement is controlled by using the 
stepper  motor.  Once  the  target  is  selected  it  can  be  tracked  by  moving  the 
camera and gun.

In  these  days  security  is  the  major  issue  for  all  over  the  world.  Security  is  very  important  in  order  to  protect 
vulnerable  and  valuable  assets  such  as  a  person,  dwelling,  community  and  nation  from  any  harm.  International 
security issues are also very important, especially border and coast security  to any country. The people of national 
security agencies, maritime security organization, military forces and other forces sacrifice their lives to protect their 
country people.  The  lives of  forces are  also very  precious  like other lives. So by using  advance technologies, the 
forces can protect their nation superiorly with minimum life losses. 
In  this  modern  era,  computer  base  security  equipments  are  very  popular  among  forces  because  they  are  more 
advance and safe for themselves. For example drone technology the “unmanned aerial vehicle” which is controlled 
automatically  by  computer  is  very  popular  these  days.  In  this  technology,  the  target  is  selected  and  hit  by  using 
computer based algorithms including image processing techniques.  
Real time image and video processing for object detection and tracking has many important applications in the field 
of computer vision (B. Coifman et al., 1998), such as video surveillance, military purposes etc. The availability of 
high quality and  inexpensive  video cameras  and the  increasing  need  for automated video analysis  has generated a 
great deal of  interest  in the areas of  motion detection,  object tracking and object targeted  (A. Yilmaz et al., 2006) 
Thus on a very high level, it is possible to identify three key steps in video analysis: detection of interesting moving 
objects,  tracking  of  the  detected objects  from  frame  to  frame,  and  analysis  of  the  object tracks  to  recognize  their 
behavior and targeted object accordingly. 
Another existing example of automatically aimed weapon is the sentry gun which aims and fires the targets which is 
selected  by  its  sensors  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_gun).    The  earliest  military  sentry  guns  were  used  in 
“Close-in  Weapon”  systems  in  which  the  target  is  detected  and  it  also  destroys  enemy  aircrafts  and  short  range 
incoming missiles (P. Croom et al., 2010). Another existing application is “Air Defense Gun” which is mounted on 
the device at the top of the army tank which automatically tracks and shoots low flying armored vehicles. 
Object detection with a camera is a revolution in  image processing which itself has applications in various civilian 
and military fields. These applications include air traffic control, navigation system, error tolerant systems, judgment 
problems, inspection, target analyze, command and control, sensor management and weapon assistance.

Our system is a combination of sentry guns and drone technology but the difference is that, it is used on earth and it 
is  implemented  by  gun  not  on  an  aircraft.  The  gun  that  automatically  aimed  and  fired  at  the  targets  which  are 
detected  by  using  image  processing  algorithms.  We  first  select  the  object,  and  then  the  gun  starts  the  tracking 
process according to the movement of camera. Once it aimed the tracked object then the gun fires automatically at 
targeted object. This operation can also be controlled manually.  
This  paper  focuses  mainly  on  the  problem  of  robust  foreground  segmentation  of  moving  objects.  This  paper  is 
organized  in  as  follow:  Section  2  describes  the  image  processing  techniques  and  section  3  describes  the  tracking 
system. 
 
System Model 
The work is divided into 4 parts. The first part is to process the video signal using Matlab in computer. The second 
part is to select the target. The third part consists of microcontroller based control unit which is used to control the 
stepper motor. Finally, the last part is to control the movement of gun. The overall block diagram of the proposed 
system is illustrated below. 

 

Processing of Video Signal 
The  first step is the processing of video signal  by using Matlab software.  The computer takes the video  from the 
camera,  process  the  video  signal  and  then  displays  its  contents  on  the  LCD  or  monitor.  The  digital  video  is  then 
converted  into  the  composite  video  format.  This  raw  digital  data  is  further  processed  to  produce  the  YCbCr 
(luminosity and chrominance) components of each frame. It is also introduced to change the pixels consequently to 
show it on VGA (Video Graphics Array).  The next part explains the procedure to select the target. 
 
Target Selection 
The target selection starts with the motion detection, which  is used as pre-processing algorithm in most of the object 
tracking  applications  (J.  S.  Lai  et  al.,  2008).  There  are  different  algorithms  used  for  motion  analysis  but  here  we 
used background subtraction to estimate the amount of motion in each frame. Background subtraction is conducted 
by using  background  estimation process  (A. Mittal  et al., 2004) which  starts with the grey  scaling and smoothing 
techniques in order to remove noise and improve sharpness. 

 

 
To  produce  delay  between  present  and  forthcoming  frames,  a  buffer  is  used  to  store  the  reference  image  for  30 
seconds. Meantime another image is captured from upcoming frame and both are subtracted with each other in order 
to estimate the background and foreground motions. The difference of both frames is a raw foreground image which 
is refined further. The raw foreground image is then converted from intensity image to binary format by applying the 
threshold  value.  By  performing  many  experiments  we  selected  the  threshold  value  as  „0.2‟,  which  means  that  in 
binary  image  if  the  value  is  greater  than  0.2,  it  will  be  treated  as  „1‟  otherwise  „0‟.  The  threshold  process  is 
explained in figure below.  

 

 
The threshold image after the background subtraction process is illustrated in figure 4. The foreground is represented 
by „1‟ white pixels and background as „0‟, black areas. 

 

 
The  binary  image  is  then  further  processed  by  using  morphological  operations.  The  morphological  operation  is  a 
process of image dilation and erosion techniques. The steps include the scanning of pixels from left to right direction 
and  analyzing  all  pixels  which  are  connected  with  foreground  and  background  orientations.  Those  pixels  whose 
neighbors  are  connected  with  foreground  are  considered  as  a  part  of  foreground  and  those  connected  with 
background  are  considered  as  background  pixels.  A  four  by  four  (3x3)  matrix  is  used  to  analyze  the  connected 
pixels. This 3x3 matrix is compared with each 3x3 pixels of the binary image. If the neighboring pixel is „1‟ then the 
other four pixels will also be treated as „1‟ and if the neighboring pixel is „0‟ then the corresponding four pixels will 
be considered as „0‟. The process of dilation and erosion is explained in figure 5 below. 
 

 

After  the  noise  removal  and  image  enhancement  by  using  dilation  and  erosion  processes  the  binary  image  from 
figure 4 is converted as in figure 6.

In order to differentiate the detected objects with each other, we labeled them as object „1‟ or object „2‟ by giving 
different values to them as explained in table below.  
 

 

Then we applied blob analysis to connect all part of the object by filling the empty spaces inside the object. A 4x4   
matrix of  „1s‟ is used as the blob factor which was put on the labeled matrix previously.  Then the neighbor of the 
foreground will be marked as „1‟ and the neighbor of background will be marked as „0‟ as shown in figure 8.  
 
After tracking the  location  and shape of the objects as discussed above, the  next step is to track the  movement of 
objects by using the micro-controller unit, which is explained in next section.  

 

 
Micro-Controller Unit 
The heart of the controlling unit is the PIC18F442 micro-controller. As explained in the above section, the location 
of  the  suspected  object  is  determined  by  the  image  processing  algorithm.  When  the  object  is  detected, the  micro-
controller performs two functions. First  is to activate the peripheral devices such as alarm,  hooter and spotlight to 
indicate the presence of the object. It is achieved by using relays. Secondly, to take the decision in order to control 
the movement of the gun, which is also achieved by using relays. The relays are connected to the micro-controller 
unit,  when  the  object  is  detected;  the  micro-controller  unit  sends  the  high  signal  to  the  relay  which  activates  the 
peripheral  devices.  To  control  the  movement  of  the  gun,  we  extracted  the  X  and  Y  co-ordinates  and  forward  it 
serially to the Matlab for further processing. Then the controller takes the decision according to the coordinates, how 
much the gun should rotate. The decision to shoot the object is also made by  the microcontroller. We also applied 
two  modes  of  controlling.  The  first  is  automated  control  mode  and  the  second  is  the  manual  control  mode.  In 
automated control mode, the system works automatically and it will take self-decision (either shoot the person who 
is detected or not). There is no need of any one to monitor or to supervise in this mode. The system is also trained in 
order to recognize the person. In automated mode, it will shoot only that person which has  an unauthorized entry to 
that  point.  Whereas,  in  manual  mode,  the  decision  to  shoot  will  be  taken  by  the  person  who  is  monitoring  the 
system. The next section explains the controlling of stepper motor to control the movement of the gun.  
 
Stepper Motor Controlling Gun 
After the detection of any unauthorized object, the gun starts tracking that object. The co-ordinates of the object are 
already  sent  to  the  computer  earlier  which  tracks  the  co-ordinates  of  the  target  and  send  the  new  location  to  the 
micro-controller unit. Then  the  micro-controller  unit controls the  movement of the gun through the stepper motor. 
To track the object, the gun is able to move in x-y plane which is achieved by mounting the gun on tripod stand. We 
used two stepper motors having the power rating  of 5.6 watts with the  step angle of 0.02 degree. One controls the 
movement of gun in horizontal direction and the other for vertical orientation. 
To  move  the  gun  to the  desired  position  on  the  x-y  plane,  the  current  position  of  the  gun  is  very  necessary  to  be 
known,  so  encoders  are  used  to  find  the  current  position  of  the  gun.  On  the  basis  of  the  current  position,  the 
microcontroller sends the information to the stepper motor about the position of the object. The main function of the 
motor is to rotate the gun according to the object. If object moves left side than motor moves anti-clock wise until 
the position of gun comes to centre of the detected object and  if object  moves right side than  motor moves clock 
wise until position of gun comes to centre of the detected object. 
 
Working of the System 
This  system  is  designed  to  track  the  suspected  object  in  real  time  and  provide  security  by  means  of  peripherals 
attached to this system. The working of the system consists of several steps which includes the processing of video 
signal from camera. The video is first converted into the raw digital format and then its luminance part is extracted 
by applying image processing algorithms. Then each frame is compared with the previous frame in order to detect 
the motion in the current frame. It is done by using background subtraction method. In this work, we applied scaling 
and  smoothing  techniques  to  remove  noise  and  to  improve  the  sharpness  of  the  image.  Then  we  calculated  the 
difference  image  by  subtracting  the  background  information.  Then  the  resultant  raw  binary  image  is  further 
processed  by  using  morphological  operations  which  results  in  the  detection  of  multiple  objects.  Then  we  applied 
blob  analysis  to  connect  all  parts  of  the  detected  image.  The  next  step  was  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the 
selected target which is achieved by sending the information to the micro-controller based system which compares 
the coordinates of the current frame with the previous one. Micro-controller then performs two functions; one is to

Once the target is selected, the microcontroller controls the movement of the gun by using the stepper motor. After 
the object is tracked, the decision to shoot the target is achieved manually or automatically by using microcontroller 
based system.  
 
Conclusion and Future Work 
The  theme  of  the  work  is  to  design  the  automated  security  system  for  surveillance  operations.  The  system  is 
designed  by using  image processing algorithms  in order to select, track and hit the target. In this  work, the  image 
processing algorithms are designed and implemented in computer based system whereas for future development, we 
can use digital signal processors (DSP) in order to make the system working in standalone mode. Another advantage 
of using DSP processors is to reduce the processing time as DSP processors are efficient and faster in performance. 
The performance of the system can also be improved by using high resolution cameras with night vision provision. 
The work can also be expanded for traffic control or military purposes.

incoming missiles (P. Croom et al., 2010). Another existing application is “Air Defense Gun” which is mounted on 
the device at the top of the army tank which automatically tracks and shoots low flying armored vehicles. 
Object detection with a camera is a revolution in  image processing which itself has applications in various civilian 
and military fields. These applications include air traffic control, navigation system, error tolerant systems, judgment 
problems, inspection, target analyze, command and control, sensor management and weapon assistance.

Our system is a combination of sentry guns and drone technology but the difference is that, it is used on earth and it 
is  implemented  by  gun  not  on  an  aircraft.  The  gun  that  automatically  aimed  and  fired  at  the  targets  which  are 
detected  by  using  image  processing  algorithms.  We  first  select  the  object,  and  then  the  gun  starts  the  tracking 
process according to the movement of camera. Once it aimed the tracked object then the gun fires automatically at 
targeted object. This operation can also be controlled manually.  
This  paper  focuses  mainly  on  the  problem  of  robust  foreground  segmentation  of  moving  objects.  This  paper  is 
organized  in  as  follow:  Section  2  describes  the  image  processing  techniques  and  section  3  describes  the  tracking 
system. 
 
System Model 
The work is divided into 4 parts. The first part is to process the video signal using Matlab in computer. The second 
part is to select the target. The third part consists of microcontroller based control unit which is used to control the 
stepper motor. Finally, the last part is to control the movement of gun. The overall block diagram of the proposed 
system is illustrated below. 

 

Processing of Video Signal 
The  first step is the processing of video signal  by using Matlab software.  The computer takes the video  from the 
camera,  process  the  video  signal  and  then  displays  its  contents  on  the  LCD  or  monitor.  The  digital  video  is  then 
converted  into  the  composite  video  format.  This  raw  digital  data  is  further  processed  to  produce  the  YCbCr 
(luminosity and chrominance) components of each frame. It is also introduced to change the pixels consequently to 
show it on VGA (Video Graphics Array).  The next part explains the procedure to select the target. 
 
Target Selection 
The target selection starts with the motion detection, which  is used as pre-processing algorithm in most of the object 
tracking  applications  (J.  S.  Lai  et  al.,  2008).  There  are  different  algorithms  used  for  motion  analysis  but  here  we 
used background subtraction to estimate the amount of motion in each frame. Background subtraction is conducted 
by using  background  estimation process  (A. Mittal  et al., 2004) which  starts with the grey  scaling and smoothing 
techniques in order to remove noise and improve sharpness. 

 

 
To  produce  delay  between  present  and  forthcoming  frames,  a  buffer  is  used  to  store  the  reference  image  for  30 
seconds. Meantime another image is captured from upcoming frame and both are subtracted with each other in order 
to estimate the background and foreground motions. The difference of both frames is a raw foreground image which 
is refined further. The raw foreground image is then converted from intensity image to binary format by applying the 
threshold  value.  By  performing  many  experiments  we  selected  the  threshold  value  as  „0.2‟,  which  means  that  in 
binary  image  if  the  value  is  greater  than  0.2,  it  will  be  treated  as  „1‟  otherwise  „0‟.  The  threshold  process  is 
explained in figure below.  

 

 
The threshold image after the background subtraction process is illustrated in figure 4. The foreground is represented 
by „1‟ white pixels and background as „0‟, black areas. 

 

 
The  binary  image  is  then  further  processed  by  using  morphological  operations.  The  morphological  operation  is  a 
process of image dilation and erosion techniques. The steps include the scanning of pixels from left to right direction 
and  analyzing  all  pixels  which  are  connected  with  foreground  and  background  orientations.  Those  pixels  whose 
neighbors  are  connected  with  foreground  are  considered  as  a  part  of  foreground  and  those  connected  with 
background  are  considered  as  background  pixels.  A  four  by  four  (3x3)  matrix  is  used  to  analyze  the  connected 
pixels. This 3x3 matrix is compared with each 3x3 pixels of the binary image. If the neighboring pixel is „1‟ then the 
other four pixels will also be treated as „1‟ and if the neighboring pixel is „0‟ then the corresponding four pixels will 
be considered as „0‟. The process of dilation and erosion is explained in figure 5 below. 
 

 

After  the  noise  removal  and  image  enhancement  by  using  dilation  and  erosion  processes  the  binary  image  from 
figure 4 is converted as in figure 6.

In order to differentiate the detected objects with each other, we labeled them as object „1‟ or object „2‟ by giving 
different values to them as explained in table below.  
 

 

Then we applied blob analysis to connect all part of the object by filling the empty spaces inside the object. A 4x4   
matrix of  „1s‟ is used as the blob factor which was put on the labeled matrix previously.  Then the neighbor of the 
foreground will be marked as „1‟ and the neighbor of background will be marked as „0‟ as shown in figure 8.  
 
After tracking the  location  and shape of the objects as discussed above, the  next step is to track the  movement of 
objects by using the micro-controller unit, which is explained in next section.  

 

 
Micro-Controller Unit 
The heart of the controlling unit is the PIC18F442 micro-controller. As explained in the above section, the location 
of  the  suspected  object  is  determined  by  the  image  processing  algorithm.  When  the  object  is  detected, the  micro-
controller performs two functions. First  is to activate the peripheral devices such as alarm,  hooter and spotlight to 
indicate the presence of the object. It is achieved by using relays. Secondly, to take the decision in order to control 
the movement of the gun, which is also achieved by using relays. The relays are connected to the micro-controller 
unit,  when  the  object  is  detected;  the  micro-controller  unit  sends  the  high  signal  to  the  relay  which  activates  the 
peripheral  devices.  To  control  the  movement  of  the  gun,  we  extracted  the  X  and  Y  co-ordinates  and  forward  it 
serially to the Matlab for further processing. Then the controller takes the decision according to the coordinates, how 
much the gun should rotate. The decision to shoot the object is also made by  the microcontroller. We also applied 
two  modes  of  controlling.  The  first  is  automated  control  mode  and  the  second  is  the  manual  control  mode.  In 
automated control mode, the system works automatically and it will take self-decision (either shoot the person who 
is detected or not). There is no need of any one to monitor or to supervise in this mode. The system is also trained in 
order to recognize the person. In automated mode, it will shoot only that person which has  an unauthorized entry to 
that  point.  Whereas,  in  manual  mode,  the  decision  to  shoot  will  be  taken  by  the  person  who  is  monitoring  the 
system. The next section explains the controlling of stepper motor to control the movement of the gun.  
 
Stepper Motor Controlling Gun 
After the detection of any unauthorized object, the gun starts tracking that object. The co-ordinates of the object are 
already  sent  to  the  computer  earlier  which  tracks  the  co-ordinates  of  the  target  and  send  the  new  location  to  the 
micro-controller unit. Then  the  micro-controller  unit controls the  movement of the gun through the stepper motor. 
To track the object, the gun is able to move in x-y plane which is achieved by mounting the gun on tripod stand. We 
used two stepper motors having the power rating  of 5.6 watts with the  step angle of 0.02 degree. One controls the 
movement of gun in horizontal direction and the other for vertical orientation. 
To  move  the  gun  to the  desired  position  on  the  x-y  plane,  the  current  position  of  the  gun  is  very  necessary  to  be 
known,  so  encoders  are  used  to  find  the  current  position  of  the  gun.  On  the  basis  of  the  current  position,  the 
microcontroller sends the information to the stepper motor about the position of the object. The main function of the 
motor is to rotate the gun according to the object. If object moves left side than motor moves anti-clock wise until 
the position of gun comes to centre of the detected object and  if object  moves right side than  motor moves clock 
wise until position of gun comes to centre of the detected object. 
 
Working of the System 
This  system  is  designed  to  track  the  suspected  object  in  real  time  and  provide  security  by  means  of  peripherals 
attached to this system. The working of the system consists of several steps which includes the processing of video 
signal from camera. The video is first converted into the raw digital format and then its luminance part is extracted 
by applying image processing algorithms. Then each frame is compared with the previous frame in order to detect 
the motion in the current frame. It is done by using background subtraction method. In this work, we applied scaling 
and  smoothing  techniques  to  remove  noise  and  to  improve  the  sharpness  of  the  image.  Then  we  calculated  the 
difference  image  by  subtracting  the  background  information.  Then  the  resultant  raw  binary  image  is  further 
processed  by  using  morphological  operations  which  results  in  the  detection  of  multiple  objects.  Then  we  applied 
blob  analysis  to  connect  all  parts  of  the  detected  image.  The  next  step  was  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the 
selected target which is achieved by sending the information to the micro-controller based system which compares 
the coordinates of the current frame with the previous one. Micro-controller then performs two functions; one is to 
activate the peripheral devices and the second is to take the decision in order to move the gun to the desired location.

Once the target is selected, the microcontroller controls the movement of the gun by using the stepper motor. After 
the object is tracked, the decision to shoot the target is achieved manually or automatically by using microcontroller 
based system.  
 
Conclusion and Future Work 
The  theme  of  the  work  is  to  design  the  automated  security  system  for  surveillance  operations.  The  system  is 
designed  by using  image processing algorithms  in order to select, track and hit the target. In this  work, the  image 
processing algorithms are designed and implemented in computer based system whereas for future development, we 
can use digital signal processors (DSP) in order to make the system working in standalone mode. Another advantage 
of using DSP processors is to reduce the processing time as DSP processors are efficient and faster in performance. 
The performance of the system can also be improved by using high resolution cameras with night vision provision. 
The work can also be expanded for traffic control or military purposes.

Introduction  

      The aim of this work is to design the automated security system in order 
to detect, track and destroy the target for surveillance operations. The system 
can  be  operated  in  two  modes,  in  which  the  target  can  be  tracked 
automatically  by  using  microcontroller  based  system.  On  other  hand,  the 
system can also be controlled manually in which the user has right to select 
the  target  and  performs  shooting  if  necessary.  The  image  processing 
algorithms are  implemented in Matlab. The process starts by processing the 
video  signal  on  computer  by  using  the  video  camera,  then  the  target  is 
selected  which  can  be  tracked  further  by  using  different  image  processing 
techniques.  After  the  selection  of  target,  the  micro-controller  unit  takes  the 
decision  to  shoot  any  unauthorized  person  or  activity  within  its  range.  The 
gun is mounted on a tripod stand and its movement is controlled by using the 
stepper  motor.  Once  the  target  is  selected  it  can  be  tracked  by  moving  the 
camera and gun.

In  these  days  security  is  the  major  issue  for  all  over  the  world.  Security  is  very  important  in  order  to  protect 
vulnerable  and  valuable  assets  such  as  a  person,  dwelling,  community  and  nation  from  any  harm.  International 
security issues are also very important, especially border and coast security  to any country. The people of national 
security agencies, maritime security organization, military forces and other forces sacrifice their lives to protect their 
country people.  The  lives of  forces are  also very  precious  like other lives. So by using  advance technologies, the 
forces can protect their nation superiorly with minimum life losses. 
In  this  modern  era,  computer  base  security  equipments  are  very  popular  among  forces  because  they  are  more 
advance and safe for themselves. For example drone technology the “unmanned aerial vehicle” which is controlled 
automatically  by  computer  is  very  popular  these  days.  In  this  technology,  the  target  is  selected  and  hit  by  using 
computer based algorithms including image processing techniques.  
Real time image and video processing for object detection and tracking has many important applications in the field 
of computer vision (B. Coifman et al., 1998), such as video surveillance, military purposes etc. The availability of 
high quality and  inexpensive  video cameras  and the  increasing  need  for automated video analysis  has generated a 
great deal of  interest  in the areas of  motion detection,  object tracking and object targeted  (A. Yilmaz et al., 2006) 
Thus on a very high level, it is possible to identify three key steps in video analysis: detection of interesting moving 
objects,  tracking  of  the  detected objects  from  frame  to  frame,  and  analysis  of  the  object tracks  to  recognize  their 
behavior and targeted object accordingly. 
Another existing example of automatically aimed weapon is the sentry gun which aims and fires the targets which is 
selected  by  its  sensors  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_gun).    The  earliest  military  sentry  guns  were  used  in 
“Close-in  Weapon”  systems  in  which  the  target  is  detected  and  it  also  destroys  enemy  aircrafts  and  short  range 
incoming missiles (P. Croom et al., 2010). Another existing application is “Air Defense Gun” which is mounted on 
the device at the top of the army tank which automatically tracks and shoots low flying armored vehicles. 
Object detection with a camera is a revolution in  image processing which itself has applications in various civilian 
and military fields. These applications include air traffic control, navigation system, error tolerant systems, judgment 
problems, inspection, target analyze, command and control, sensor management and weapon assistance.

Our system is a combination of sentry guns and drone technology but the difference is that, it is used on earth and it 
is  implemented  by  gun  not  on  an  aircraft.  The  gun  that  automatically  aimed  and  fired  at  the  targets  which  are 
detected  by  using  image  processing  algorithms.  We  first  select  the  object,  and  then  the  gun  starts  the  tracking 
process according to the movement of camera. Once it aimed the tracked object then the gun fires automatically at 
targeted object. This operation can also be controlled manually.  
This  paper  focuses  mainly  on  the  problem  of  robust  foreground  segmentation  of  moving  objects.  This  paper  is 
organized  in  as  follow:  Section  2  describes  the  image  processing  techniques  and  section  3  describes  the  tracking 
system. 
 
System Model 
The work is divided into 4 parts. The first part is to process the video signal using Matlab in computer. The second 
part is to select the target. The third part consists of microcontroller based control unit which is used to control the 
stepper motor. Finally, the last part is to control the movement of gun. The overall block diagram of the proposed 
system is illustrated below. 

 

Processing of Video Signal 
The  first step is the processing of video signal  by using Matlab software.  The computer takes the video  from the 
camera,  process  the  video  signal  and  then  displays  its  contents  on  the  LCD  or  monitor.  The  digital  video  is  then 
converted  into  the  composite  video  format.  This  raw  digital  data  is  further  processed  to  produce  the  YCbCr 
(luminosity and chrominance) components of each frame. It is also introduced to change the pixels consequently to 
show it on VGA (Video Graphics Array).  The next part explains the procedure to select the target. 
 
Target Selection 
The target selection starts with the motion detection, which  is used as pre-processing algorithm in most of the object 
tracking  applications  (J.  S.  Lai  et  al.,  2008).  There  are  different  algorithms  used  for  motion  analysis  but  here  we 
used background subtraction to estimate the amount of motion in each frame. Background subtraction is conducted 
by using  background  estimation process  (A. Mittal  et al., 2004) which  starts with the grey  scaling and smoothing 
techniques in order to remove noise and improve sharpness. 

 

 
To  produce  delay  between  present  and  forthcoming  frames,  a  buffer  is  used  to  store  the  reference  image  for  30 
seconds. Meantime another image is captured from upcoming frame and both are subtracted with each other in order 
to estimate the background and foreground motions. The difference of both frames is a raw foreground image which 
is refined further. The raw foreground image is then converted from intensity image to binary format by applying the 
threshold  value.  By  performing  many  experiments  we  selected  the  threshold  value  as  „0.2‟,  which  means  that  in 
binary  image  if  the  value  is  greater  than  0.2,  it  will  be  treated  as  „1‟  otherwise  „0‟.  The  threshold  process  is 
explained in figure below.  

 

 
The threshold image after the background subtraction process is illustrated in figure 4. The foreground is represented 
by „1‟ white pixels and background as „0‟, black areas. 

 

 
The  binary  image  is  then  further  processed  by  using  morphological  operations.  The  morphological  operation  is  a 
process of image dilation and erosion techniques. The steps include the scanning of pixels from left to right direction 
and  analyzing  all  pixels  which  are  connected  with  foreground  and  background  orientations.  Those  pixels  whose 
neighbors  are  connected  with  foreground  are  considered  as  a  part  of  foreground  and  those  connected  with 
background  are  considered  as  background  pixels.  A  four  by  four  (3x3)  matrix  is  used  to  analyze  the  connected 
pixels. This 3x3 matrix is compared with each 3x3 pixels of the binary image. If the neighboring pixel is „1‟ then the 
other four pixels will also be treated as „1‟ and if the neighboring pixel is „0‟ then the corresponding four pixels will 
be considered as „0‟. The process of dilation and erosion is explained in figure 5 below. 
 

 

After  the  noise  removal  and  image  enhancement  by  using  dilation  and  erosion  processes  the  binary  image  from 
figure 4 is converted as in figure 6.

In order to differentiate the detected objects with each other, we labeled them as object „1‟ or object „2‟ by giving 
different values to them as explained in table below.  
 

 

Then we applied blob analysis to connect all part of the object by filling the empty spaces inside the object. A 4x4   
matrix of  „1s‟ is used as the blob factor which was put on the labeled matrix previously.  Then the neighbor of the 
foreground will be marked as „1‟ and the neighbor of background will be marked as „0‟ as shown in figure 8.  
 
After tracking the  location  and shape of the objects as discussed above, the  next step is to track the  movement of 
objects by using the micro-controller unit, which is explained in next section.  

 

 
Micro-Controller Unit 
The heart of the controlling unit is the PIC18F442 micro-controller. As explained in the above section, the location 
of  the  suspected  object  is  determined  by  the  image  processing  algorithm.  When  the  object  is  detected, the  micro-
controller performs two functions. First  is to activate the peripheral devices such as alarm,  hooter and spotlight to 
indicate the presence of the object. It is achieved by using relays. Secondly, to take the decision in order to control 
the movement of the gun, which is also achieved by using relays. The relays are connected to the micro-controller 
unit,  when  the  object  is  detected;  the  micro-controller  unit  sends  the  high  signal  to  the  relay  which  activates  the 
peripheral  devices.  To  control  the  movement  of  the  gun,  we  extracted  the  X  and  Y  co-ordinates  and  forward  it 
serially to the Matlab for further processing. Then the controller takes the decision according to the coordinates, how 
much the gun should rotate. The decision to shoot the object is also made by  the microcontroller. We also applied 
two  modes  of  controlling.  The  first  is  automated  control  mode  and  the  second  is  the  manual  control  mode.  In 
automated control mode, the system works automatically and it will take self-decision (either shoot the person who 
is detected or not). There is no need of any one to monitor or to supervise in this mode. The system is also trained in 
order to recognize the person. In automated mode, it will shoot only that person which has  an unauthorized entry to 
that  point.  Whereas,  in  manual  mode,  the  decision  to  shoot  will  be  taken  by  the  person  who  is  monitoring  the 
system. The next section explains the controlling of stepper motor to control the movement of the gun.  
 
Stepper Motor Controlling Gun 
After the detection of any unauthorized object, the gun starts tracking that object. The co-ordinates of the object are 
already  sent  to  the  computer  earlier  which  tracks  the  co-ordinates  of  the  target  and  send  the  new  location  to  the 
micro-controller unit. Then  the  micro-controller  unit controls the  movement of the gun through the stepper motor. 
To track the object, the gun is able to move in x-y plane which is achieved by mounting the gun on tripod stand. We 
used two stepper motors having the power rating  of 5.6 watts with the  step angle of 0.02 degree. One controls the 
movement of gun in horizontal direction and the other for vertical orientation. 
To  move  the  gun  to the  desired  position  on  the  x-y  plane,  the  current  position  of  the  gun  is  very  necessary  to  be 
known,  so  encoders  are  used  to  find  the  current  position  of  the  gun.  On  the  basis  of  the  current  position,  the 
microcontroller sends the information to the stepper motor about the position of the object. The main function of the 
motor is to rotate the gun according to the object. If object moves left side than motor moves anti-clock wise until 
the position of gun comes to centre of the detected object and  if object  moves right side than  motor moves clock 
wise until position of gun comes to centre of the detected object. 
 
Working of the System 
This  system  is  designed  to  track  the  suspected  object  in  real  time  and  provide  security  by  means  of  peripherals 
attached to this system. The working of the system consists of several steps which includes the processing of video 
signal from camera. The video is first converted into the raw digital format and then its luminance part is extracted 
by applying image processing algorithms. Then each frame is compared with the previous frame in order to detect 
the motion in the current frame. It is done by using background subtraction method. In this work, we applied scaling 
and  smoothing  techniques  to  remove  noise  and  to  improve  the  sharpness  of  the  image.  Then  we  calculated  the 
difference  image  by  subtracting  the  background  information.  Then  the  resultant  raw  binary  image  is  further 
processed  by  using  morphological  operations  which  results  in  the  detection  of  multiple  objects.  Then  we  applied 
blob  analysis  to  connect  all  parts  of  the  detected  image.  The  next  step  was  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the 
selected target which is achieved by sending the information to the micro-controller based system which compares 
the coordinates of the current frame with the previous one. Micro-controller then performs two functions; one is to 
activate the peripheral devices and the second is to take the decision in order to move the gun to the desired location.

Once the target is selected, the microcontroller controls the movement of the gun by using the stepper motor. After 
the object is tracked, the decision to shoot the target is achieved manually or automatically by using microcontroller 
based system.

Introduction  

      The aim of this work is to design the automated security system in order 
to detect, track and destroy the target for surveillance operations. The system 
can  be  operated  in  two  modes,  in  which  the  target  can  be  tracked 
automatically  by  using  microcontroller  based  system.  On  other  hand,  the 
system can also be controlled manually in which the user has right to select 
the  target  and  performs  shooting  if  necessary.  The  image  processing 
algorithms are  implemented in Matlab. The process starts by processing the 
video  signal  on  computer  by  using  the  video  camera,  then  the  target  is 
selected  which  can  be  tracked  further  by  using  different  image  processing 
techniques.  After  the  selection  of  target,  the  micro-controller  unit  takes  the 
decision  to  shoot  any  unauthorized  person  or  activity  within  its  range.  The 
gun is mounted on a tripod stand and its movement is controlled by using the 
stepper  motor.  Once  the  target  is  selected  it  can  be  tracked  by  moving  the 
camera and gun.

In  these  days  security  is  the  major  issue  for  all  over  the  world.  Security  is  very  important  in  order  to  protect 
vulnerable  and  valuable  assets  such  as  a  person,  dwelling,  community  and  nation  from  any  harm.  International 
security issues are also very important, especially border and coast security  to any country. The people of national 
security agencies, maritime security organization, military forces and other forces sacrifice their lives to protect their 
country people.  The  lives of  forces are  also very  precious  like other lives. So by using  advance technologies, the 
forces can protect their nation superiorly with minimum life losses. 
In  this  modern  era,  computer  base  security  equipments  are  very  popular  among  forces  because  they  are  more 
advance and safe for themselves. For example drone technology the “unmanned aerial vehicle” which is controlled 
automatically  by  computer  is  very  popular  these  days.  In  this  technology,  the  target  is  selected  and  hit  by  using 
computer based algorithms including image processing techniques.  
Real time image and video processing for object detection and tracking has many important applications in the field 
of computer vision (B. Coifman et al., 1998), such as video surveillance, military purposes etc. The availability of 
high quality and  inexpensive  video cameras  and the  increasing  need  for automated video analysis  has generated a 
great deal of  interest  in the areas of  motion detection,  object tracking and object targeted  (A. Yilmaz et al., 2006) 
Thus on a very high level, it is possible to identify three key steps in video analysis: detection of interesting moving 
objects,  tracking  of  the  detected objects  from  frame  to  frame,  and  analysis  of  the  object tracks  to  recognize  their 
behavior and targeted object accordingly. 
Another existing example of automatically aimed weapon is the sentry gun which aims and fires the targets which is 
selected  by  its  sensors  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_gun).    The  earliest  military  sentry  guns  were  used  in 
“Close-in  Weapon”  systems  in  which  the  target  is  detected  and  it  also  destroys  enemy  aircrafts  and  short  range 
incoming missiles (P. Croom et al., 2010). Another existing application is “Air Defense Gun” which is mounted on 
the device at the top of the army tank which automatically tracks and shoots low flying armored vehicles. 
Object detection with a camera is a revolution in  image processing which itself has applications in various civilian 
and military fields. These applications include air traffic control, navigation system, error tolerant systems, judgment 
problems, inspection, target analyze, command and control, sensor management and weapon assistance.

Our system is a combination of sentry guns and drone technology but the difference is that, it is used on earth and it 
is  implemented  by  gun  not  on  an  aircraft.  The  gun  that  automatically  aimed  and  fired  at  the  targets  which  are 
detected  by  using  image  processing  algorithms.  We  first  select  the  object,  and  then  the  gun  starts  the  tracking 
process according to the movement of camera. Once it aimed the tracked object then the gun fires automatically at 
targeted object. This operation can also be controlled manually.  
This  paper  focuses  mainly  on  the  problem  of  robust  foreground  segmentation  of  moving  objects.  This  paper  is 
organized  in  as  follow:  Section  2  describes  the  image  processing  techniques  and  section  3  describes  the  tracking 
system. 
 
System Model 
The work is divided into 4 parts. The first part is to process the video signal using Matlab in computer. The second 
part is to select the target. The third part consists of microcontroller based control unit which is used to control the 
stepper motor. Finally, the last part is to control the movement of gun. The overall block diagram of the proposed 
system is illustrated below. 

 

Processing of Video Signal 
The  first step is the processing of video signal  by using Matlab software.  The computer takes the video  from the 
camera,  process  the  video  signal  and  then  displays  its  contents  on  the  LCD  or  monitor.  The  digital  video  is  then 
converted  into  the  composite  video  format.  This  raw  digital  data  is  further  processed  to  produce  the  YCbCr 
(luminosity and chrominance) components of each frame. It is also introduced to change the pixels consequently to 
show it on VGA (Video Graphics Array).  The next part explains the procedure to select the target. 
 
Target Selection 
The target selection starts with the motion detection, which  is used as pre-processing algorithm in most of the object 
tracking  applications  (J.  S.  Lai  et  al.,  2008).  There  are  different  algorithms  used  for  motion  analysis  but  here  we 
used background subtraction to estimate the amount of motion in each frame. Background subtraction is conducted 
by using  background  estimation process  (A. Mittal  et al., 2004) which  starts with the grey  scaling and smoothing 
techniques in order to remove noise and improve sharpness. 

 

 
To  produce  delay  between  present  and  forthcoming  frames,  a  buffer  is  used  to  store  the  reference  image  for  30 
seconds. Meantime another image is captured from upcoming frame and both are subtracted with each other in order 
to estimate the background and foreground motions. The difference of both frames is a raw foreground image which 
is refined further. The raw foreground image is then converted from intensity image to binary format by applying the 
threshold  value.  By  performing  many  experiments  we  selected  the  threshold  value  as  „0.2‟,  which  means  that  in 
binary  image  if  the  value  is  greater  than  0.2,  it  will  be  treated  as  „1‟  otherwise  „0‟.  The  threshold  process  is 
explained in figure below.  

 

 
The threshold image after the background subtraction process is illustrated in figure 4. The foreground is represented 
by „1‟ white pixels and background as „0‟, black areas. 

 

 
The  binary  image  is  then  further  processed  by  using  morphological  operations.  The  morphological  operation  is  a 
process of image dilation and erosion techniques. The steps include the scanning of pixels from left to right direction 
and  analyzing  all  pixels  which  are  connected  with  foreground  and  background  orientations.  Those  pixels  whose 
neighbors  are  connected  with  foreground  are  considered  as  a  part  of  foreground  and  those  connected  with 
background  are  considered  as  background  pixels.  A  four  by  four  (3x3)  matrix  is  used  to  analyze  the  connected 
pixels. This 3x3 matrix is compared with each 3x3 pixels of the binary image. If the neighboring pixel is „1‟ then the 
other four pixels will also be treated as „1‟ and if the neighboring pixel is „0‟ then the corresponding four pixels will 
be considered as „0‟. The process of dilation and erosion is explained in figure 5 below. 
 

 

After  the  noise  removal  and  image  enhancement  by  using  dilation  and  erosion  processes  the  binary  image  from 
figure 4 is converted as in figure 6.

In order to differentiate the detected objects with each other, we labeled them as object „1‟ or object „2‟ by giving 
different values to them as explained in table below.  
 

 

Then we applied blob analysis to connect all part of the object by filling the empty spaces inside the object. A 4x4   
matrix of  „1s‟ is used as the blob factor which was put on the labeled matrix previously.  Then the neighbor of the 
foreground will be marked as „1‟ and the neighbor of background will be marked as „0‟ as shown in figure 8.  
 
After tracking the  location  and shape of the objects as discussed above, the  next step is to track the  movement of 
objects by using the micro-controller unit, which is explained in next section.  

 

 
Micro-Controller Unit 
The heart of the controlling unit is the PIC18F442 micro-controller. As explained in the above section, the location 
of  the  suspected  object  is  determined  by  the  image  processing  algorithm.  When  the  object  is  detected, the  micro-
controller performs two functions. First  is to activate the peripheral devices such as alarm,  hooter and spotlight to 
indicate the presence of the object. It is achieved by using relays. Secondly, to take the decision in order to control 
the movement of the gun, which is also achieved by using relays. The relays are connected to the micro-controller 
unit,  when  the  object  is  detected;  the  micro-controller  unit  sends  the  high  signal  to  the  relay  which  activates  the 
peripheral  devices.  To  control  the  movement  of  the  gun,  we  extracted  the  X  and  Y  co-ordinates  and  forward  it 
serially to the Matlab for further processing. Then the controller takes the decision according to the coordinates, how 
much the gun should rotate. The decision to shoot the object is also made by  the microcontroller. We also applied 
two  modes  of  controlling.  The  first  is  automated  control  mode  and  the  second  is  the  manual  control  mode.  In 
automated control mode, the system works automatically and it will take self-decision (either shoot the person who 
is detected or not). There is no need of any one to monitor or to supervise in this mode. The system is also trained in 
order to recognize the person. In automated mode, it will shoot only that person which has  an unauthorized entry to 
that  point.  Whereas,  in  manual  mode,  the  decision  to  shoot  will  be  taken  by  the  person  who  is  monitoring  the 
system. The next section explains the controlling of stepper motor to control the movement of the gun.  
 
Stepper Motor Controlling Gun 
After the detection of any unauthorized object, the gun starts tracking that object. The co-ordinates of the object are 
already  sent  to  the  computer  earlier  which  tracks  the  co-ordinates  of  the  target  and  send  the  new  location  to  the 
micro-controller unit. Then  the  micro-controller  unit controls the  movement of the gun through the stepper motor. 
To track the object, the gun is able to move in x-y plane which is achieved by mounting the gun on tripod stand. We 
used two stepper motors having the power rating  of 5.6 watts with the  step angle of 0.02 degree. One controls the 
movement of gun in horizontal direction and the other for vertical orientation. 
To  move  the  gun  to the  desired  position  on  the  x-y  plane,  the  current  position  of  the  gun  is  very  necessary  to  be 
known,  so  encoders  are  used  to  find  the  current  position  of  the  gun.  On  the  basis  of  the  current  position,  the 
microcontroller sends the information to the stepper motor about the position of the object. The main function of the 
motor is to rotate the gun according to the object. If object moves left side than motor moves anti-clock wise until 
the position of gun comes to centre of the detected object and  if object  moves right side than  motor moves clock 
wise until position of gun comes to centre of the detected object. 
 
Working of the System 
This  system  is  designed  to  track  the  suspected  object  in  real  time  and  provide  security  by  means  of  peripherals 
attached to this system. The working of the system consists of several steps which includes the processing of video 
signal from camera. The video is first converted into the raw digital format and then its luminance part is extracted 
by applying image processing algorithms. Then each frame is compared with the previous frame in order to detect 
the motion in the current frame. It is done by using background subtraction method. In this work, we applied scaling 
and  smoothing  techniques  to  remove  noise  and  to  improve  the  sharpness  of  the  image.  Then  we  calculated  the 
difference  image  by  subtracting  the  background  information.  Then  the  resultant  raw  binary  image  is  further 
processed  by  using  morphological  operations  which  results  in  the  detection  of  multiple  objects.  Then  we  applied 
blob  analysis  to  connect  all  parts  of  the  detected  image.  The  next  step  was  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the
