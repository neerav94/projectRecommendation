Abstract 

With  the  smart  phone  app,  BIS  can  be  implemented  easily  and  conveniently  without  big 
cost. This BIS system, however, has a weak point that the location information of the bus can 
be  revised  easily.  For  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS 
service, this paper introduces the security augmenting scheme for the bus information system 
that  is  composed  of  the  smart  phone  app  without  extra  infrastructure  like  wireless  LAN  or 
wireless relay system.

1. Introduction 

With  the  start  of  21st  century,  the  expansion  and  the  evolution  of  the  mobile 
communication  started  to  cause  the  change  of  life  style  of  normal  people.  In  addition,  the 
people’s lives have been changed enormously with the invention of smart-phone, which was 
around the year 2010.  

The  smart-phone  enabled  us  to  think  again  about  every  convenient  system  around  us 
because it has a various abilities that can change the system without any cost. One of those 
systems  is  bus  information  system  (BIS).  BIS  has  been  devised  to  provide  people  with  the 
information of bus location and arrival time, etc. But usually BIS requires huge cost to build 
the  basic  infrastructure  for  the  service.  Therefore,  the  small  bus  company  or  school  bus 
system  could  not  afford  to  buy  BIS  even  though  they  need  the  system  desperately  [1].  The 
reason for them to have BIS is because BIS can provide the location services to the students 
and  parents  through  Internet.  BIS,  therefore,  can  be  said  to  be  helpful  in  providing  security 
services of students. 

In this paper, we focused in providing BIS services with low cost. We proposed the system 
architecture  based  on  smart-phone  and  specific  APP  with  server,  which  can  provide  BIS 
service without big cost. While devising the system architecture of BIS, however, we found 
the  security  problem  that  could  possibly  affect  the  whole  system  operation.  This  paper  is 
trying to solve the problem by proposing the security augmenting system to the BIS based on 
smart-phone. 

In  this  paper,  therefore,  you  can  find  the  system  architecture  of  BIS  and  security 
augmenting  system  for  BIS  together.  And  also  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  BIS  is 
introduced with the operating scene of BIS.

location  from  the  GPS  system  in  the  bus  should  be  delivered  the  local  server  to  update  the 
location  information  of  the  bus.  And  this  information  should  be  delivered  to  the  passenger 
information  board  in  the  bus  station.  Therefore  the  buses  should  be  equipped  with  lots  of 
expensive gadgets to provide BIS services to passengers [3, 4].

Figure 2. Bus information system based on Smart-Phone 

 

As we can see in Figure 2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the bus location information to the local server. And passengers can find bus information like 
arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus station. Since the normal 
smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G mobile network to the dedicated 
server, the local server can elaborate the bus location information after collecting information 
from the driver’s smart-phone.  

For this, we need special application program for driver’s smart-phone and server program. 
The  driver’s  smart  phone  should  act  like  the  device  equipped  in  the  bus  in  normal  BIS.  It 
should be able to send the bus location after it receives GPS information from satellite.  

Also  the  local  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers  through 
Internet.  Therefore,  server  should  provide  web  service  for  Internet  users  and  distribute  the 
information  for  APP  users  in  order  that  passengers  can  find  bus  information  through  their 
smart-phone or display panel connected to Internet. 

To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the local 
location  server  are  most  important  in  BIS  based  on  smart-phone.  Detailed  features  are 
explained  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  driver’s  smart-phone  has  to  collect  GPS 
information from satellite when the bus is running on schedule while the designated driver is 
driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone  should  send  the  GPS  information  with  the  bus 
identification to local location server periodically to make sure the server follow its location. 
The  local  location  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and 
processing  the  information  from  the  bus.  Since  the  information  should  be  provide  in  many 
ways, local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would be 
normal  web,  mobile  web,  text  information  for  bus  station  panel  and  information  for  smart-
phone users.

2.2   Security matter in bus information system based on Smart-Phone  

The  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone  has  a  critical  problem  in  security  aspect.  The 
problem  is  that  the  location  information  of  the  dedicated  bus  is  totally  dependent  on  the 
driver’s location because the driver’s smart phone is the device that sends the bus information 
to the local location server.  

Therefore  there  could  be a  case  that  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS  is  operating  without 
any  thought  while  the  driver  is  not  driving  the  bus.  And  also  the  driver’s  application  can 
possibly  send  other bus information  when  the  driver changed  the  bus. This  might  cause the 
big flaws in the proposed BIS based on smart phone.  

Every  information  system  has  to  be  equipped  with  the  proper  security  system  for  the 
perfection of the services. To prevent those malfunctioning case and augment security aspect 
of  the  proposed  BIS,  we  propose  the  security  augmenting  scheme  for  BIS  based  on  smart-
phone. 
 
3. Security augmenting scheme for BIS  

To  augment  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone,  the  small 
device that can communicate in short rage wirelessly need to be attached to every bus, which 
can identify each bus with special code assigned to each bus. This is described in Figure 4.

services, usually huge communication infrastructure is required as shown in Figure 1 [2]. 

This  system  like  in  Figure  1  could  enjoy  many  benefits  of  real-time  BIS.  However,  it 
requires  huge  cost to construct  the  support  system.  As  you  can see in the figure,  first  of  all 
normal  BIS  requires  buses  to  be  equipped  with  the  wireless  communication  devices  like 
CDMA  or  WiFi.  Then  each  bus  is  required  to  be  positioned  with  GPS  equipments.  The 
location  from  the  GPS  system  in  the  bus  should  be  delivered  the  local  server  to  update  the 
location  information  of  the  bus.  And  this  information  should  be  delivered  to  the  passenger 
information  board  in  the  bus  station.  Therefore  the  buses  should  be  equipped  with  lots  of 
expensive gadgets to provide BIS services to passengers [3, 4].

 Therefore, lots  of  small  bus  companies like  school  bus  or  private  institute bus could  not 
afford  to  provide  the  BIS  services  to  the  clients  even  though  the  service  is  required  for  the 
security  reason  for  students.  To  provide  BIS  services  with  small  cost,  this  paper  introduces 
BIS  based  on  smart-phone  and  explain  the  security  matter  related  to  the  system  operation. 
And the security augmenting system for BIS will be proposed with the operating algorithm. 

 

2.1   Bus Information System based on Smart-Phone  

These  days  smart-phone  has  many  features  like  camera,  GPS,  many  sensors  and  lots  of 
other personal programs. With the some functions of smart-phone, we can simulate the BIS 
services. Figure 2 shows the architecture of BIS based on Smart-phone.

Figure 2. Bus information system based on Smart-Phone 

 

As we can see in Figure 2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the bus location information to the local server. And passengers can find bus information like 
arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus station. Since the normal 
smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G mobile network to the dedicated 
server, the local server can elaborate the bus location information after collecting information 
from the driver’s smart-phone.  

For this, we need special application program for driver’s smart-phone and server program. 
The  driver’s  smart  phone  should  act  like  the  device  equipped  in  the  bus  in  normal  BIS.  It 
should be able to send the bus location after it receives GPS information from satellite.  

Also  the  local  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers  through 
Internet.  Therefore,  server  should  provide  web  service  for  Internet  users  and  distribute  the 
information  for  APP  users  in  order  that  passengers  can  find  bus  information  through  their 
smart-phone or display panel connected to Internet. 

To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the local 
location  server  are  most  important  in  BIS  based  on  smart-phone.  Detailed  features  are 
explained  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  driver’s  smart-phone  has  to  collect  GPS 
information from satellite when the bus is running on schedule while the designated driver is 
driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone  should  send  the  GPS  information  with  the  bus 
identification to local location server periodically to make sure the server follow its location. 
The  local  location  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and 
processing  the  information  from  the  bus.  Since  the  information  should  be  provide  in  many 
ways, local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would be 
normal  web,  mobile  web,  text  information  for  bus  station  panel  and  information  for  smart-
phone users.

2.2   Security matter in bus information system based on Smart-Phone  

The  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone  has  a  critical  problem  in  security  aspect.  The 
problem  is  that  the  location  information  of  the  dedicated  bus  is  totally  dependent  on  the 
driver’s location because the driver’s smart phone is the device that sends the bus information 
to the local location server.  

Therefore  there  could  be a  case  that  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS  is  operating  without 
any  thought  while  the  driver  is  not  driving  the  bus.  And  also  the  driver’s  application  can 
possibly  send  other bus information  when  the  driver changed  the  bus. This  might  cause the 
big flaws in the proposed BIS based on smart phone.  

Every  information  system  has  to  be  equipped  with  the  proper  security  system  for  the 
perfection of the services. To prevent those malfunctioning case and augment security aspect 
of  the  proposed  BIS,  we  propose  the  security  augmenting  scheme  for  BIS  based  on  smart-
phone. 
 
3. Security augmenting scheme for BIS  

To  augment  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone,  the  small 
device that can communicate in short rage wirelessly need to be attached to every bus, which 
can identify each bus with special code assigned to each bus. This is described in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Process architecture in driver’s smart-phone 

 
As  shown  in  Figure  4,  in  order  to  activate  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS,  the  driver’s 
smart phone is required to get a special code through wireless communication from the device 
attached  to  the  bus.  In  other  words,  when  the  driver  operate  the  driver’s  APP  for  BIS,  the 
checking process in the APP start to communicate with the wireless device attached to the bus 
and  verify  the  bus.  If  the  verification  process  was  successful,  this  process  wakes  up  other 
processes to perform its mission. The process that is required to get the GPS information from 
satellite is waken up by the verification process. After getting GPS information from satellite, 
this  information  is  sent  to  the  sending  process  that  is  designed  to  send  GPS  information 
through WiFi or mobile interfaces like 3G/4G. 

With  the  wireless  device  attached  to  the  bus,  the  driver’s  smart-phone  continues  to 
communicate  to  verify  whether  the  driver  is  still  driving  in  driver’s  seat.  Otherwise,  the 
communication session would break shortly and the BIS APP in driver’s smart-phone would 
inform  the  local  server  that  the  driver  has  quitted  driving  the  bus.  This  whole  operation  is 
described as a flowchart in Figure 5.

Abstract 

With  the  smart  phone  app,  BIS  can  be  implemented  easily  and  conveniently  without  big 
cost. This BIS system, however, has a weak point that the location information of the bus can 
be  revised  easily.  For  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS 
service, this paper introduces the security augmenting scheme for the bus information system 
that  is  composed  of  the  smart  phone  app  without  extra  infrastructure  like  wireless  LAN  or 
wireless relay system.

1. Introduction 

With  the  start  of  21st  century,  the  expansion  and  the  evolution  of  the  mobile 
communication  started  to  cause  the  change  of  life  style  of  normal  people.  In  addition,  the 
people’s lives have been changed enormously with the invention of smart-phone, which was 
around the year 2010.  

The  smart-phone  enabled  us  to  think  again  about  every  convenient  system  around  us 
because it has a various abilities that can change the system without any cost. One of those 
systems  is  bus  information  system  (BIS).  BIS  has  been  devised  to  provide  people  with  the 
information of bus location and arrival time, etc. But usually BIS requires huge cost to build 
the  basic  infrastructure  for  the  service.  Therefore,  the  small  bus  company  or  school  bus 
system  could  not  afford  to  buy  BIS  even  though  they  need  the  system  desperately  [1].  The 
reason for them to have BIS is because BIS can provide the location services to the students 
and  parents  through  Internet.  BIS,  therefore,  can  be  said  to  be  helpful  in  providing  security 
services of students. 

In this paper, we focused in providing BIS services with low cost. We proposed the system 
architecture  based  on  smart-phone  and  specific  APP  with  server,  which  can  provide  BIS 
service without big cost. While devising the system architecture of BIS, however, we found 
the  security  problem  that  could  possibly  affect  the  whole  system  operation.  This  paper  is 
trying to solve the problem by proposing the security augmenting system to the BIS based on 
smart-phone. 

In  this  paper,  therefore,  you  can  find  the  system  architecture  of  BIS  and  security 
augmenting  system  for  BIS  together.  And  also  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  BIS  is 
introduced with the operating scene of BIS.

services, usually huge communication infrastructure is required as shown in Figure 1 [2]. 

This  system  like  in  Figure  1  could  enjoy  many  benefits  of  real-time  BIS.  However,  it

problem  is  that  the  location  information  of  the  dedicated  bus  is  totally  dependent  on  the 
driver’s location because the driver’s smart phone is the device that sends the bus information 
to the local location server.  

Therefore  there  could  be a  case  that  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS  is  operating  without 
any  thought  while  the  driver  is  not  driving  the  bus.  And  also  the  driver’s  application  can 
possibly  send  other bus information  when  the  driver changed  the  bus. This  might  cause the 
big flaws in the proposed BIS based on smart phone.  

Every  information  system  has  to  be  equipped  with  the  proper  security  system  for  the 
perfection of the services. To prevent those malfunctioning case and augment security aspect 
of  the  proposed  BIS,  we  propose  the  security  augmenting  scheme  for  BIS  based  on  smart-
phone. 
 
3. Security augmenting scheme for BIS  

To  augment  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone,  the  small 
device that can communicate in short rage wirelessly need to be attached to every bus, which 
can identify each bus with special code assigned to each bus. This is described in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Process architecture in driver’s smart-phone 

 
As  shown  in  Figure  4,  in  order  to  activate  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS,  the  driver’s 
smart phone is required to get a special code through wireless communication from the device 
attached  to  the  bus.  In  other  words,  when  the  driver  operate  the  driver’s  APP  for  BIS,  the 
checking process in the APP start to communicate with the wireless device attached to the bus 
and  verify  the  bus.  If  the  verification  process  was  successful,  this  process  wakes  up  other 
processes to perform its mission. The process that is required to get the GPS information from 
satellite is waken up by the verification process. After getting GPS information from satellite, 
this  information  is  sent  to  the  sending  process  that  is  designed  to  send  GPS  information 
through WiFi or mobile interfaces like 3G/4G. 

With  the  wireless  device  attached  to  the  bus,  the  driver’s  smart-phone  continues  to 
communicate  to  verify  whether  the  driver  is  still  driving  in  driver’s  seat.  Otherwise,  the 
communication session would break shortly and the BIS APP in driver’s smart-phone would 
inform  the  local  server  that  the  driver  has  quitted  driving  the  bus.  This  whole  operation  is 
described as a flowchart in Figure 5.

mobile network.

the bus.

the  bus  ID  anymore,  it  should  issue  the  message  that  the  BIS  service  cannot  be 
sustained any longer. And the BIS APP in the driver’s smart-phone should kill itself.

4. Implementation of BIS based on smart phone 

We  have  implemented  the  BIS  proposed  in  the  paper.  The  implementation  of  the  BIS  is 
based  on  the  architecture  in  Section  2.  The  system  is  mainly  composed  of  three  parts:  The 
driver’s APP in smart phone, the location server and the user’s APP to see the location of the 
bus.

Figure  6  shows  the  driver’s  APP  for  getting  the  location  information  of  the  bus  and 
sending the information to the location server. When you start the APP, the first image of the 
APP is (a) of Figure 6. Then the APP will show the (b) of Figure 6 when it is ready to operate. 
When the driver press the start button, it will start to operate and show the (c) of Figure 6.  

As explained in Section 3, the driver’s APP will begin its operation by start to verify the 
bus through wireless communication. In our implementation, the BlueTooth was used. When 
the  verification  was  successful,  the  driver’s  APP  starts  to  collect  the  GPS  information  and 
send this information to the location server. 

The server was implemented as shown in Figure 7. This server collects the GPS location 
information  periodically  and  updates  this  information  when  it  receives  location  information 
from the driver’s APP. 

The BIS users can use the passenger APP or Internet access to see the bus location, which 
is  shown  in  Figure  8.  In  order  for  users  to  see  the  bus  location  through  Internet  with  web 
browser,  the  server  provides  the  web  service.  And  the  server  also  provides  the  location 
information to the user’s APP.

Abstract 

With  the  smart  phone  app,  BIS  can  be  implemented  easily  and  conveniently  without  big 
cost. This BIS system, however, has a weak point that the location information of the bus can 
be  revised  easily.  For  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS 
service, this paper introduces the security augmenting scheme for the bus information system 
that  is  composed  of  the  smart  phone  app  without  extra  infrastructure  like  wireless  LAN  or 
wireless relay system.

1. Introduction 

With  the  start  of  21st  century,  the  expansion  and  the  evolution  of  the  mobile 
communication  started  to  cause  the  change  of  life  style  of  normal  people.  In  addition,  the 
people’s lives have been changed enormously with the invention of smart-phone, which was 
around the year 2010.  

The  smart-phone  enabled  us  to  think  again  about  every  convenient  system  around  us 
because it has a various abilities that can change the system without any cost. One of those 
systems  is  bus  information  system  (BIS).  BIS  has  been  devised  to  provide  people  with  the 
information of bus location and arrival time, etc. But usually BIS requires huge cost to build 
the  basic  infrastructure  for  the  service.  Therefore,  the  small  bus  company  or  school  bus 
system  could  not  afford  to  buy  BIS  even  though  they  need  the  system  desperately  [1].  The 
reason for them to have BIS is because BIS can provide the location services to the students 
and  parents  through  Internet.  BIS,  therefore,  can  be  said  to  be  helpful  in  providing  security 
services of students. 

In this paper, we focused in providing BIS services with low cost. We proposed the system 
architecture  based  on  smart-phone  and  specific  APP  with  server,  which  can  provide  BIS 
service without big cost. While devising the system architecture of BIS, however, we found 
the  security  problem  that  could  possibly  affect  the  whole  system  operation.  This  paper  is 
trying to solve the problem by proposing the security augmenting system to the BIS based on 
smart-phone. 

In  this  paper,  therefore,  you  can  find  the  system  architecture  of  BIS  and  security 
augmenting  system  for  BIS  together.  And  also  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  BIS  is 
introduced with the operating scene of BIS. 
 
2. BIS: Bus Information System 

Bus  Information  System  (BIS),  which  is  sometimes  known  as  passenger  system  in  other 
countries out of Korea, means a system that can provide bus information such as route, arrival

time transit information to help passengers with effective transit decision. For this normal BIS 
services, usually huge communication infrastructure is required as shown in Figure 1 [2]. 

This  system  like  in  Figure  1  could  enjoy  many  benefits  of  real-time  BIS.  However,  it 
requires  huge  cost to construct  the  support  system.  As  you  can see in the figure,  first  of  all 
normal  BIS  requires  buses  to  be  equipped  with  the  wireless  communication  devices  like 
CDMA  or  WiFi.  Then  each  bus  is  required  to  be  positioned  with  GPS  equipments.  The 
location  from  the  GPS  system  in  the  bus  should  be  delivered  the  local  server  to  update  the 
location  information  of  the  bus.  And  this  information  should  be  delivered  to  the  passenger 
information  board  in  the  bus  station.  Therefore  the  buses  should  be  equipped  with  lots  of 
expensive gadgets to provide BIS services to passengers [3, 4]. 

 

 

Figure 1. Normal bus information system 

 
 Therefore, lots  of  small  bus  companies like  school  bus  or  private  institute bus could  not 
afford  to  provide  the  BIS  services  to  the  clients  even  though  the  service  is  required  for  the 
security  reason  for  students.  To  provide  BIS  services  with  small  cost,  this  paper  introduces 
BIS  based  on  smart-phone  and  explain  the  security  matter  related  to  the  system  operation. 
And the security augmenting system for BIS will be proposed with the operating algorithm. 

 

2.1   Bus Information System based on Smart-Phone  

These  days  smart-phone  has  many  features  like  camera,  GPS,  many  sensors  and  lots  of 
other personal programs. With the some functions of smart-phone, we can simulate the BIS 
services. Figure 2 shows the architecture of BIS based on Smart-phone.

Figure 2. Bus information system based on Smart-Phone 

 

As we can see in Figure 2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the bus location information to the local server. And passengers can find bus information like 
arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus station. Since the normal 
smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G mobile network to the dedicated 
server, the local server can elaborate the bus location information after collecting information 
from the driver’s smart-phone.  

For this, we need special application program for driver’s smart-phone and server program. 
The  driver’s  smart  phone  should  act  like  the  device  equipped  in  the  bus  in  normal  BIS.  It 
should be able to send the bus location after it receives GPS information from satellite.  

Also  the  local  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers  through 
Internet.  Therefore,  server  should  provide  web  service  for  Internet  users  and  distribute  the 
information  for  APP  users  in  order  that  passengers  can  find  bus  information  through  their 
smart-phone or display panel connected to Internet. 

To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the local 
location  server  are  most  important  in  BIS  based  on  smart-phone.  Detailed  features  are 
explained  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  driver’s  smart-phone  has  to  collect  GPS 
information from satellite when the bus is running on schedule while the designated driver is 
driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone  should  send  the  GPS  information  with  the  bus 
identification to local location server periodically to make sure the server follow its location. 
The  local  location  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and 
processing  the  information  from  the  bus.  Since  the  information  should  be  provide  in  many 
ways, local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would be 
normal  web,  mobile  web,  text  information  for  bus  station  panel  and  information  for  smart-
phone users.

5. Conclusions 

This paper has introduced the new bus information system based on smart-phone. Since the 
smart  phones  are  multi  tasking  and  very  resourceful these  days,  we  can  replace many  usual 
expensive  systems  with  APPs  in  smart  phones.  The  same  idea  has  been  adopted  in  the 
proposed  BIS.  But  the  proposed  BIS  has  the  security  problem  that  could  create  serious 
problem  when  it  is  used  in  real  situation.  To  prevent  this  security  problem,  the  security 
augmenting scheme has been proposed in this paper. With the proposed scheme, the proposed 
BIS based on smart phone is expected to provide bus information services with very low cost.

As we can see in Figure 2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the bus location information to the local server. And passengers can find bus information like 
arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus station. Since the normal 
smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G mobile network to the dedicated

For this, we need special application program for driver’s smart-phone and server program. 
The  driver’s  smart  phone  should  act  like  the  device  equipped  in  the  bus  in  normal  BIS.  It 
should be able to send the bus location after it receives GPS information from satellite.  

Also  the  local  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers  through 
Internet.  Therefore,  server  should  provide  web  service  for  Internet  users  and  distribute  the 
information  for  APP  users  in  order  that  passengers  can  find  bus  information  through  their 
smart-phone or display panel connected to Internet. 

To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the local 
location  server  are  most  important  in  BIS  based  on  smart-phone.  Detailed  features  are 
explained  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  driver’s  smart-phone  has  to  collect  GPS 
information from satellite when the bus is running on schedule while the designated driver is 
driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone  should  send  the  GPS  information  with  the  bus 
identification to local location server periodically to make sure the server follow its location. 
The  local  location  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and 
processing  the  information  from  the  bus.  Since  the  information  should  be  provide  in  many 
ways, local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would be 
normal  web,  mobile  web,  text  information  for  bus  station  panel  and  information  for  smart-
phone users.

2.2   Security matter in bus information system based on Smart-Phone  

The  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone  has  a  critical  problem  in  security  aspect.  The 
problem  is  that  the  location  information  of  the  dedicated  bus  is  totally  dependent  on  the 
driver’s location because the driver’s smart phone is the device that sends the bus information 
to the local location server.  

Therefore  there  could  be a  case  that  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS  is  operating  without 
any  thought  while  the  driver  is  not  driving  the  bus.  And  also  the  driver’s  application  can 
possibly  send  other bus information  when  the  driver changed  the  bus. This  might  cause the 
big flaws in the proposed BIS based on smart phone.  

Every  information  system  has  to  be  equipped  with  the  proper  security  system  for  the 
perfection of the services. To prevent those malfunctioning case and augment security aspect 
of  the  proposed  BIS,  we  propose  the  security  augmenting  scheme  for  BIS  based  on  smart-
phone. 
 
3. Security augmenting scheme for BIS  

To  augment  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS  based  on  smart-phone,  the  small 
device that can communicate in short rage wirelessly need to be attached to every bus, which 
can identify each bus with special code assigned to each bus. This is described in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Process architecture in driver’s smart-phone 

 
As  shown  in  Figure  4,  in  order  to  activate  the  driver’s  application  for  BIS,  the  driver’s 
smart phone is required to get a special code through wireless communication from the device 
attached  to  the  bus.  In  other  words,  when  the  driver  operate  the  driver’s  APP  for  BIS,  the 
checking process in the APP start to communicate with the wireless device attached to the bus 
and  verify  the  bus.  If  the  verification  process  was  successful,  this  process  wakes  up  other 
processes to perform its mission. The process that is required to get the GPS information from 
satellite is waken up by the verification process. After getting GPS information from satellite, 
this  information  is  sent  to  the  sending  process  that  is  designed  to  send  GPS  information 
through WiFi or mobile interfaces like 3G/4G. 

With  the  wireless  device  attached  to  the  bus,  the  driver’s  smart-phone  continues  to 
communicate  to  verify  whether  the  driver  is  still  driving  in  driver’s  seat.  Otherwise,  the 
communication session would break shortly and the BIS APP in driver’s smart-phone would 
inform  the  local  server  that  the  driver  has  quitted  driving  the  bus.  This  whole  operation  is 
described as a flowchart in Figure 5.

wireless  device  in  the  bus,  it  continues  to  next  step.  Otherwise,  the  BIS  APP  in

③  Once the BIS APP is successful in getting the bus ID through wireless device in the 
bus, it start to collect the GPS information and send them to the local location server 
through  smart-phone  mobile  interface,  which  is  connected  to  Internet  via  3G/4G 
mobile network. 

④  Once the BIS APP in the driver’s smart-phone succeeded in sending GPS information 
to server, it should check the availability of wireless device to see the driver is still in 
the bus. 

⑤  If the BIS APP in the driver’s smart-phone cannot access the wireless device and get 
the  bus  ID  anymore,  it  should  issue  the  message  that  the  BIS  service  cannot  be 
sustained any longer. And the BIS APP in the driver’s smart-phone should kill itself.

4. Implementation of BIS based on smart phone 

We  have  implemented  the  BIS  proposed  in  the  paper.  The  implementation  of  the  BIS  is 
based  on  the  architecture  in  Section  2.  The  system  is  mainly  composed  of  three  parts:  The 
driver’s APP in smart phone, the location server and the user’s APP to see the location of the 
bus. 

 

 

Figure 6. APP for location sending in driver’s smart-phone 

 
Figure  6  shows  the  driver’s  APP  for  getting  the  location  information  of  the  bus  and 
sending the information to the location server. When you start the APP, the first image of the 
APP is (a) of Figure 6. Then the APP will show the (b) of Figure 6 when it is ready to operate. 
When the driver press the start button, it will start to operate and show the (c) of Figure 6.  

As explained in Section 3, the driver’s APP will begin its operation by start to verify the 
bus through wireless communication. In our implementation, the BlueTooth was used. When 
the  verification  was  successful,  the  driver’s  APP  starts  to  collect  the  GPS  information  and 
send this information to the location server. 

The server was implemented as shown in Figure 7. This server collects the GPS location 
information  periodically  and  updates  this  information  when  it  receives  location  information 
from the driver’s APP. 

The BIS users can use the passenger APP or Internet access to see the bus location, which 
is  shown  in  Figure  8.  In  order  for  users  to  see  the  bus  location  through  Internet  with  web 
browser,  the  server  provides  the  web  service.  And  the  server  also  provides  the  location 
information to the user’s APP.

5. Conclusions 

This paper has introduced the new bus information system based on smart-phone. Since the 
smart  phones  are  multi  tasking  and  very  resourceful these  days,  we  can  replace many  usual 
expensive  systems  with  APPs  in  smart  phones.  The  same  idea  has  been  adopted  in  the 
proposed  BIS.  But  the  proposed  BIS  has  the  security  problem  that  could  create  serious 
problem  when  it  is  used  in  real  situation.  To  prevent  this  security  problem,  the  security 
augmenting scheme has been proposed in this paper. With the proposed scheme, the proposed 
BIS based on smart phone is expected to provide bus information services with very low cost.

Abstract 

With  the  smart  phone  app,  BIS  can  be  implemented  easily  and  conveniently  without  big 
cost. This BIS system, however, has a weak point that the location information of the bus can 
be  revised  easily.  For  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the  security  aspect  of  the  proposed  BIS 
service, this paper introduces the security augmenting scheme for the bus information system 
that  is  composed  of  the  smart  phone  app  without  extra  infrastructure  like  wireless  LAN  or 
wireless relay system. 

 
Keywords: BIS System, Security Augmenting, Smart-Phone 

 
1. Introduction 

With  the  start  of  21st  century,  the  expansion  and  the  evolution  of  the  mobile 
communication  started  to  cause  the  change  of  life  style  of  normal  people.  In  addition,  the 
people’s lives have been changed enormously with the invention of smart-phone, which was 
around the year 2010.  

The  smart-phone  enabled  us  to  think  again  about  every  convenient  system  around  us 
because it has a various abilities that can change the system without any cost. One of those 
systems  is  bus  information  system  (BIS).  BIS  has  been  devised  to  provide  people  with  the 
information of bus location and arrival time, etc. But usually BIS requires huge cost to build 
the  basic  infrastructure  for  the  service.  Therefore,  the  small  bus  company  or  school  bus 
system  could  not  afford  to  buy  BIS  even  though  they  need  the  system  desperately  [1].  The 
reason for them to have BIS is because BIS can provide the location services to the students 
and  parents  through  Internet.  BIS,  therefore,  can  be  said  to  be  helpful  in  providing  security 
services of students. 

In this paper, we focused in providing BIS services with low cost. We proposed the system 
architecture  based  on  smart-phone  and  specific  APP  with  server,  which  can  provide  BIS 
service without big cost. While devising the system architecture of BIS, however, we found 
the  security  problem  that  could  possibly  affect  the  whole  system  operation.  This  paper  is 
trying to solve the problem by proposing the security augmenting system to the BIS based on 
smart-phone. 

In  this  paper,  therefore,  you  can  find  the  system  architecture  of  BIS  and  security 
augmenting  system  for  BIS  together.  And  also  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  BIS  is 
introduced with the operating scene of BIS. 
 
2. BIS: Bus Information System 

Bus  Information  System  (BIS),  which  is  sometimes  known  as  passenger  system  in  other 
countries out of Korea, means a system that can provide bus information such as route, arrival

time transit information to help passengers with effective transit decision. For this normal BIS 
services, usually huge communication infrastructure is required as shown in Figure 1 [2]. 

This  system  like  in  Figure  1  could  enjoy  many  benefits  of  real-time  BIS.  However,  it 
requires  huge  cost to construct  the  support  system.  As  you  can see in the figure,  first  of  all 
normal  BIS  requires  buses  to  be  equipped  with  the  wireless  communication  devices  like 
CDMA  or  WiFi.  Then  each  bus  is  required  to  be  positioned  with  GPS  equipments.  The 
location  from  the  GPS  system  in  the  bus  should  be  delivered  the  local  server  to  update  the 
location  information  of  the  bus.  And  this  information  should  be  delivered  to  the  passenger 
information  board  in  the  bus  station.  Therefore  the  buses  should  be  equipped  with  lots  of 
expensive gadgets to provide BIS services to passengers [3, 4]. 

 

 

Figure 1. Normal bus information system 

 
 Therefore, lots  of  small  bus  companies like  school  bus  or  private  institute bus could  not 
afford  to  provide  the  BIS  services  to  the  clients  even  though  the  service  is  required  for  the 
security  reason  for  students.  To  provide  BIS  services  with  small  cost,  this  paper  introduces 
BIS  based  on  smart-phone  and  explain  the  security  matter  related  to  the  system  operation. 
And the security augmenting system for BIS will be proposed with the operating algorithm. 

 

2.1   Bus Information System based on Smart-Phone  

These  days  smart-phone  has  many  features  like  camera,  GPS,  many  sensors  and  lots  of 
other personal programs. With the some functions of smart-phone, we can simulate the BIS 
services. Figure 2 shows the architecture of BIS based on Smart-phone.

Figure 2. Bus information system based on Smart-Phone 

 

As we can see in Figure 2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the bus location information to the local server. And passengers can find bus information like 
arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus station. Since the normal 
smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G mobile network to the dedicated 
server, the local server can elaborate the bus location information after collecting information 
from the driver’s smart-phone.  

For this, we need special application program for driver’s smart-phone and server program. 
The  driver’s  smart  phone  should  act  like  the  device  equipped  in  the  bus  in  normal  BIS.  It 
should be able to send the bus location after it receives GPS information from satellite.  

Also  the  local  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers  through 
Internet.  Therefore,  server  should  provide  web  service  for  Internet  users  and  distribute  the 
information  for  APP  users  in  order  that  passengers  can  find  bus  information  through  their 
smart-phone or display panel connected to Internet. 

To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the local 
location  server  are  most  important  in  BIS  based  on  smart-phone.  Detailed  features  are 
explained  in  Figure  3.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  driver’s  smart-phone  has  to  collect  GPS 
information from satellite when the bus is running on schedule while the designated driver is 
driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone  should  send  the  GPS  information  with  the  bus 
identification to local location server periodically to make sure the server follow its location. 
The  local  location  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and 
processing  the  information  from  the  bus.  Since  the  information  should  be  provide  in  many 
ways, local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would be 
normal  web,  mobile  web,  text  information  for  bus  station  panel  and  information  for  smart-
phone users.
