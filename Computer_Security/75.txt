 ABSTRACT – The Fisherman Autoboat system uses GPS 
that  stands  for  global  positioning  system  which  finds  out 
the location and position of the boat in ocean. The main aim 
of  this  Autoboat  system  is  to  identify  the  zone.  By  using 
ultrasonic sensor, iceberg in the sea can be found out while 
travelling in boat or ship. As well as, to find the prediction 
of  tsunami  MEMS  is  being  used.  If  the  fisherman  crosses 
the limitation of border it gives voice message, even though 
if  he  try  to  move  forward  then  automatically  motor  of  the 
ship/boat  will  stop.  For  weather  report,  temperature  and 
humidity sensor is used. 

In the problematic time, from the control room the 
navy  section  can  trace  out  the  ship/boat  which  has  crossed 
the border & in danger for the rescue, and also there is one 
emergency  switch  available  on  the  boat  side  that  will 
inform  about  the  route  to  home.  A  ZigBee  transmitter  is 
used to transmit these data from the transmitter side.

I. INTRODUCTION 

GPS  radio  occultation  has  proved  to  be  a  powerful 
tool  for  remotely  sensing  the  Earth’s  neutral  atmosphere  and 
ionosphere. Through this project, we propose a novel approach 
to  retrieving  marine  troposphere  profiles  based  on  single 
ground-based  GPS  occultation  observations.  A  new  retrieval 
method  uses  the  data  from  a  ground-based  receiver  while  the 
GPS satellites rise or set at the local horizon in the direction of 
the  ocean  [1].  The  subsequent  experiment  was  carried  out  on 
the coast of the Yellow Sea from August 2010 to July  2011 in 
this  regard  a  GPS  based  system  determines  the  location  of 
maritime  boundary  in  the  ocean  which  is  not  visible  to  the 
mariners and they cross it. A GPS receiver is set on earth while 
the satellite raises high in universe [2]. An ultrasonic sensor is 
used  for  detection  of  iceberg  and  MEMS  is  implemented  to 
and crosses the boundary and detect vibration in the ocean .The 
relevant information is visible on LCD also.  

A  temperature  and  humidity  sensor  is  used  to  report 
weather.  The  buzzer  beeps  when  boat  approaches  the  iceberg. 
A  ZigBee  transmitter  is  used  to  transmit  these  data  from  the 
transmitter  side.  The  ZigBee  receiver  receives  the  transmitted 
parameters  and  monitored  through  display  unit.  In  this 
transmitter is Master and it will be in constant place. While the 

receiver enters into particular limit it automatically receives the 
data from transmitter and displayed. 

 

II. EXISTING SYSTEM 

At present, there are few existing systems which help 
to  identify  the  current  position  of  the  boats/ships  using  GPS 
system and view them in an electronic  map. GPS provides the 
fastest  and  most  accurate  method  for  mariners  to  navigate, 
measure speed, and determine location. This enables increased 
levels  of  efficiency  for  mariners  worldwide  and  accurate 
position,  speed  and  heading  are  needed  to  ensure  the  vessel 
reach its destination safely. 

In  the  present  system  a  GPS  receiver  is  available  in 
the boat while the GPS satellite raises high in the universe. The 
satellite  observes  the  latitude  and  longitude  of  the  boat’s 
position  and  calculates  for  the  location.  So,  the  mariners  can 
find  out  the  place  where  the  boat  is  and  also  the  direction  of 
motion. 
 

 
The  GPS equipped  boat  has the advantage  of  moving 
in the right direction. As the ocean is so much spread that it is 
almost  impossible  to  find  out  in  which  direction  one  has  to 
navigate. This facility enables to find out the correct way to the 
destination  thereby  increasing  the  level  of  convenience  to  the 
mariners. 
 
II.1 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM 
 
1. Lack of awareness causes accident -The fishermen are not 
aware of the maritime boundary and they tend to cross it. This 
causes  the  situation  of  dispute  and  loss  of  life.  Also,  no  such 
system  for  warning  is  present  when  the  boat  crosses  the 
maritime  boundary  or  when  boat  approaches  any  iceberg  .So 
this can lead to accidents. 
2. No  alarming  and  warning  system  is  present  for  icebergs 
and tsunami.-The boat is not well-equipped with any alarming 
or security  system that causes loss  of lives.  The fishermen  are 
not warned of any iceberg in the ocean, tsunami and crossing of 
the  maritime  boundary.  This  causes  improper  attention  during 
the  navigation  process  and  unknowingly  the  fishermen  had  to 
lose their lives. 
3. No security system is present which causes loss of life-No 
security from the rescue team can be obtained as no system for 
informing  the  coastal  guards  is  present.  The  coastal  guards 
have the rights to save the fishermen when they are in danger.

But  since they are not  known  to the  emergency  situation,  they 
cannot send any help from their side. 
 
 

 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM 
 

The  proposed  system  is  used  to  detect  the  maritime 
boundary  of  the  country  where  the  long  time  dispute  between 
Sri  Lanka  and  India  still  exists.  This  mainly  happens  when 
fisherman  crosses  maritime  border  of  neighboring  country  as 
he is not aware of the limits in sea.  

The  proposed  system  uses  a  GPS  receiver  which 
receives signals from the satellite and gives the current position 
of  the  boat.  With  already  known  details  of  the  latitude  and 
longitude  of  the  maritime  boundary,  the  microcontroller 
calculates  the  current  position  and  stored  boundary  positions 
and indicates the fisherman that he has crossed the boundary by 
an  alarm  system.  It  also  uses  a  message  transmitter  to  send 
message to the base station which monitors the boats in the sea.  
This  system  provides  an  indication  to  both  fisherman 
and  to  coastal  guard.  Thus  the  system  saves  the  lives  of  the 
fisherman  or  reduces  the  damages  caused  to  them  by  Lankan 
coast guards. 

       Additionally,  sensors  for  iceberg  detection  and  tsunami 
prediction have been included. A report for weather can also be 
obtained  through  temperature  and  humidity  sensor.  These  all 
features have been made cheap in order to be installed on boats 
of  fishermen  for 
the  system 
economical.

A  sensor  such  as  ultrasonic  is  used  for  detection  of  the 
iceberg  and  MEMS  for  Tsunami.  Humidity  and  temperature 
sensor is used for weather report. The signals of all the sensors 
are  given  to  the  microcontroller  through  ADC.  With  already 
known  set  point  in  microcontroller  maritime  boundary  is 
detected. If the boat crosses the border a message through voice 
board  is  heard  and  viewed  through  LCD.  The  motor  gets 
switched off as it crosses the boundary.

GPS  radio  occultation  has  proved  to  be  a  powerful

to  retrieving  marine  troposphere  profiles  based  on  single

method  uses  the  data  from  a  ground-based  receiver  while  the 
GPS satellites rise or set at the local horizon in the direction of 
the  ocean  [1].  The  subsequent  experiment  was  carried  out  on 
the coast of the Yellow Sea from August 2010 to July  2011 in 
this  regard  a  GPS  based  system  determines  the  location  of 
maritime  boundary  in  the  ocean  which  is  not  visible  to  the 
mariners and they cross it. A GPS receiver is set on earth while 
the satellite raises high in universe [2]. An ultrasonic sensor is 
used  for  detection  of  iceberg  and  MEMS  is  implemented  to 
and crosses the boundary and detect vibration in the ocean .The 
relevant information is visible on LCD also.  

A  temperature  and  humidity  sensor  is  used  to  report 
weather.  The  buzzer  beeps  when  boat  approaches  the  iceberg. 
A  ZigBee  transmitter  is  used  to  transmit  these  data  from  the

transmitter is Master and it will be in constant place. While the 

receiver enters into particular limit it automatically receives the 
data from transmitter and displayed. 

 

II. EXISTING SYSTEM 

At present, there are few existing systems which help 
to  identify  the  current  position  of  the  boats/ships  using  GPS 
system and view them in an electronic  map. GPS provides the 
fastest  and  most  accurate  method  for  mariners  to  navigate, 
measure speed, and determine location. This enables increased 
levels  of  efficiency  for  mariners  worldwide  and  accurate 
position,  speed  and  heading  are  needed  to  ensure  the  vessel 
reach its destination safely. 

In  the  present  system  a  GPS  receiver  is  available  in 
the boat while the GPS satellite raises high in the universe. The 
satellite  observes  the  latitude  and  longitude  of  the  boat’s 
position  and  calculates  for  the  location.  So,  the  mariners  can 
find  out  the  place  where  the  boat  is  and  also  the  direction  of 
motion. 
 

 
The  GPS equipped  boat  has the advantage  of  moving 
in the right direction. As the ocean is so much spread that it is 
almost  impossible  to  find  out  in  which  direction  one  has  to 
navigate. This facility enables to find out the correct way to the 
destination  thereby  increasing  the  level  of  convenience  to  the 
mariners. 
 
II.1 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM 
 
1. Lack of awareness causes accident -The fishermen are not 
aware of the maritime boundary and they tend to cross it. This 
causes  the  situation  of  dispute  and  loss  of  life.  Also,  no  such 
system  for  warning  is  present  when  the  boat  crosses  the 
maritime  boundary  or  when  boat  approaches  any  iceberg  .So 
this can lead to accidents. 
2. No  alarming  and  warning  system  is  present  for  icebergs 
and tsunami.-The boat is not well-equipped with any alarming 
or security  system that causes loss  of lives.  The fishermen  are 
not warned of any iceberg in the ocean, tsunami and crossing of 
the  maritime  boundary.  This  causes  improper  attention  during 
the  navigation  process  and  unknowingly  the  fishermen  had  to 
lose their lives. 
3. No security system is present which causes loss of life-No 
security from the rescue team can be obtained as no system for 
informing  the  coastal  guards  is  present.  The  coastal  guards 
have the rights to save the fishermen when they are in danger.

But  since they are not  known  to the  emergency  situation,  they 
cannot send any help from their side. 
 
 

 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM 
 

The  proposed  system  is  used  to  detect  the  maritime 
boundary  of  the  country  where  the  long  time  dispute  between 
Sri  Lanka  and  India  still  exists.  This  mainly  happens  when 
fisherman  crosses  maritime  border  of  neighboring  country  as 
he is not aware of the limits in sea.  

The  proposed  system  uses  a  GPS  receiver  which 
receives signals from the satellite and gives the current position 
of  the  boat.  With  already  known  details  of  the  latitude  and 
longitude  of  the  maritime  boundary,  the  microcontroller 
calculates  the  current  position  and  stored  boundary  positions 
and indicates the fisherman that he has crossed the boundary by 
an  alarm  system.  It  also  uses  a  message  transmitter  to  send 
message to the base station which monitors the boats in the sea.  
This  system  provides  an  indication  to  both  fisherman 
and  to  coastal  guard.  Thus  the  system  saves  the  lives  of  the 
fisherman  or  reduces  the  damages  caused  to  them  by  Lankan 
coast guards. 

       Additionally,  sensors  for  iceberg  detection  and  tsunami 
prediction have been included. A report for weather can also be 
obtained  through  temperature  and  humidity  sensor.  These  all 
features have been made cheap in order to be installed on boats 
of  fishermen  for 
the  system 
economical.

A  sensor  such  as  ultrasonic  is  used  for  detection  of  the 
iceberg  and  MEMS  for  Tsunami.  Humidity  and  temperature 
sensor is used for weather report. The signals of all the sensors 
are  given  to  the  microcontroller  through  ADC.  With  already 
known  set  point  in  microcontroller  maritime  boundary  is 
detected. If the boat crosses the border a message through voice 
board  is  heard  and  viewed  through  LCD.  The  motor  gets 
switched off as it crosses the boundary.

maritime  boundary  for  the  fishermen  and  a  proper  warning 
system in order to prevent their lives while they cross the Indo-
Srilankan  maritime  boundary  unknowingly.  Also  there  is  a 

system where the motor automatically gets off if the fishermen 
cross the border. 

Furthermore  we  have  also  been  able  to  create  an 
alarming  system  for  an  iceberg  or  tsunami  in  the  ocean.  The 
same can be viewed in the LCD display also. 

The weather report and detection helps the mariner to 
find  the  condition  of  weather  and  decide  if  it  is  suitable  for 
them to go in the ocean for navigation or not.

V.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
 

 

This  system  implements  GPS  and  Embedded  system 
together  to  create  a  security  system.  The  fisherman,  while 
navigating crosses the maritime boundary, unknowingly as they 
are  unable  to  visualize  it  in  the  ocean  which  causes  loss  to  its 
life.  Through  this  project  a  GPS  based  security  system  is 
provided  to  the  fisherman  so  that  they  can  find  out  when  they 
are in danger. 

In  this  system,  a  GPS  receiver  is  being  set  up  on  the 
earth  and  through  satellite  all  the  information  regarding 
crossing  of  the  maritime  boundary  can  be  obtained  by  the 
mariners  and  coastal  guards  .In  case  of  any  danger  the  rescue 
team  will  be  sent  to  them.  A  variety  of  sensors  are  used  for 
detection  of  other  parameters.  An  iceberg  can  be  detected 
through  ultrasonic  sensor,  Tsunami  through  MEMS  and  for 
weather  report  temperature  and  humidity  sensor  is  being 
implemented. 
 
This  system  is  an  implication  of  security  system  for 
safe  navigation  of  mariner’s  auto  boat.  It  is  a  helpful  step  in 
saving  lives  of  fisherman  and  a  useful  contribution  to  the 
society.

 ABSTRACT – The Fisherman Autoboat system uses GPS 
that  stands  for  global  positioning  system  which  finds  out 
the location and position of the boat in ocean. The main aim 
of  this  Autoboat  system  is  to  identify  the  zone.  By  using 
ultrasonic sensor, iceberg in the sea can be found out while 
travelling in boat or ship. As well as, to find the prediction 
of  tsunami  MEMS  is  being  used.  If  the  fisherman  crosses 
the limitation of border it gives voice message, even though 
if  he  try  to  move  forward  then  automatically  motor  of  the 
ship/boat  will  stop.  For  weather  report,  temperature  and 
humidity sensor is used. 

In the problematic time, from the control room the 
navy  section  can  trace  out  the  ship/boat  which  has  crossed 
the border & in danger for the rescue, and also there is one 
emergency  switch  available  on  the  boat  side  that  will 
inform  about  the  route  to  home.  A  ZigBee  transmitter  is 
used to transmit these data from the transmitter side.

I. INTRODUCTION 

GPS  radio  occultation  has  proved  to  be  a  powerful 
tool  for  remotely  sensing  the  Earth’s  neutral  atmosphere  and 
ionosphere. Through this project, we propose a novel approach 
to  retrieving  marine  troposphere  profiles  based  on  single 
ground-based  GPS  occultation  observations.  A  new  retrieval 
method  uses  the  data  from  a  ground-based  receiver  while  the 
GPS satellites rise or set at the local horizon in the direction of 
the  ocean  [1].  The  subsequent  experiment  was  carried  out  on 
the coast of the Yellow Sea from August 2010 to July  2011 in 
this  regard  a  GPS  based  system  determines  the  location  of 
maritime  boundary  in  the  ocean  which  is  not  visible  to  the 
mariners and they cross it. A GPS receiver is set on earth while 
the satellite raises high in universe [2]. An ultrasonic sensor is 
used  for  detection  of  iceberg  and  MEMS  is  implemented  to 
and crosses the boundary and detect vibration in the ocean .The 
relevant information is visible on LCD also.  

A  temperature  and  humidity  sensor  is  used  to  report 
weather.  The  buzzer  beeps  when  boat  approaches  the  iceberg. 
A  ZigBee  transmitter  is  used  to  transmit  these  data  from  the 
transmitter  side.  The  ZigBee  receiver  receives  the  transmitted 
parameters  and  monitored  through  display  unit.  In  this 
transmitter is Master and it will be in constant place. While the 

receiver enters into particular limit it automatically receives the 
data from transmitter and displayed.

are  unable  to  find  the  marine  boundary  in  the  ocean  by  their 
own  and  also  unable  to  predict  any  iceberg  or  tsunami. 
Additionally, it helps in finding weather conditions  

In future, technological  improvements can  be done to 
get  the  alert  signals  on  smart  phones  to  reduce  complexity  of 
components and cost. The smart phones are now available at a 
very cheap rate and are used by almost everyone in the society 
without taking in account  of the economical  status. So it  is an 
imagination  to  use  smart  phones  for  the  alert  and  warning  in 
place  of the complex  hardwares which will  reduce  complexity 
and thereby enhancing ease of operation.
