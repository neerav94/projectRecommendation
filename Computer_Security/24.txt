Abstract: This paper is based on biometrics which provides automatic identification of an individual based on
a unique feature or characteristics possessed by an individual. Iris recognition is regarded as the most reliable
and accurate biometric identification system available. The system has been effectively implemented for the
intensive  care units in  the hospital  as a security  measure to prevent illegal access. Implementation of this

INTRODUCTION

Object  segmentation,  Normalization,  Encoding  and
matching are the building blocks of this biometric system.
The goal of this is to match the acquired image with the
database so that the ICU door is accessed when the image
is matched [1].

The input image is fed to the iris recognition system
which consists of an automated segmentation system that
is based on the canny edge detection system and hough
transform, which is able to localize the circular iris and
pupil  region,  occluding  eyelids  and  eyelashes.  The
extracted iris region is then normalized into a rectangular
block  with  constant  dimensions  to  account  for  imaging
inconsistencies [2]. Finally, the phase data from 1D log
gabor  filter  is  extracted  and  quantized  to  encode  the
unique  pattern  of  the  iris  in  to  a  bit-wise  biometric
template. The  hamming  distance 
is  employed  for
classification  of  iris  templates.  The  two  iris  codes  are
found to  match if the hamming distance is  below 0.35,
which is a fractional measure of the dissimilarity [3].

actual iris region in a digital eye image. It is also used for
the removal of artifacts from the image due to eyelids and

information in that image.Edge detection is often the first
step in image segmentation. Image segmentation, a field
of image analysis, is used to group pixels into regions to
determine an image's composition [6].

Canny Method: The Canny edge detection algorithm is
known to many as the optimal edge detector. It is optimal
for  step  edges  corrupted  by  white  noise.  Canny  edge
detection  follows  a  list  of  criteria  to  improve  current
methods of edge detection.

Gamma    Correction:    A    gamma    function  is  used  to
correct
  the    brightness    profile    of    an    image  by
multiplying  each  pixel  by  the  value  of  the function.
This is typically done in order to prepare the image for
display or printing on a particular device. The brightness
of  an  image  can  be  adjusted  with  a  gamma  correction
transformation [5].

Non-Maximum Suppression 
Interpolation:
Interpolation  is  the  process  used  to
estimate an image value at a location in between image
pixels.

Image    Thresholding:      Image      thresholding      is a
subclass  of  image  segmentation.  In  the  case  of  image
thres  holding,  the  objective  is   to   divide   an  image
into two   segments  only. The criterion for assigning a
pixel  to  either  segment is whether its value is less or
larger than a prescribed threshold value. A binary image
is obtained by marking pixels with values less than the
threshold with zeros and the remaining pixels with ones
[7].

algorithms typically  are  followed  by  linking  another
boundary  detection  procedures  designed  to  assemble
edge pixels into meaningful boundaries. The edge linking
technique used here is hough transform [8].

Segmentation of Iris:
Isolation of Top Eyelid:

Normalization: Normalization transforms the iris region in
to a  fixed  dimension  in  order  to  allow  accurate
comparison.  It  produces  an  iris  region  with  constant
dimension  so  that  two  photographs  of  same  iris  under
different condition will have same characteristic feature at
the same spatial location.

Feature Encoding: In this stage the most discriminating
information present  in  the  iris  pattern  is  extracted.  The
extracted  features  are  encoded  so  that  comparison
between templates can be made.

Feature      encoding      was      implemented

by
convolving  the  normalized  iris  pattern with  1  D Log-
Gabor  wavelets.  The  2D  normalized  pattern  is  broken
up into a number of 1D signals are convolved with 1 D
gabor  wavelets.  Gabor  filters  are  used  mostly  in  shape
detection  and  feature  extraction  in  image  processing.
Gabor wavelets  are  specialized  filters

regions.  Thus  edge  detection Matching:  Matching-based  segmentation  localizes  all
image  positions  at  which  close  copies  of  the  searched
pattern are located. These copies must match the pattern
in size and rotation and the geometric distortion must be
small.

Hough Transform:  The  Hough  transform  is  a  feature
extraction technique used in digital image processing. The
classical transform identifies lines in the image, but it has
been  extended  to  identifying  positions  of  arbitrary
shapes.

In  this  Hamming  distance  is  used  to  measure  how
many  bits  are  the  sam  between  two  bit  patterns.  In
comparing any two bit pattern, the hamming distance, HD,
is  defined  as  the  sum  of  disagreeing  bits  (sum  of  the
exclusive-OR between two bit patterns) over N, the total
number of the bits in the bit pattern.

CONCLUSION

Object  segmentation,  Normalization,  Encoding  and

The goal of this is to match the acquired image with the

The input image is fed to the iris recognition system
which consists of an automated segmentation system that
is based on the canny edge detection system and hough

hamming  distance  is  employed  for  classification  of  iris

The two iris codes are found to match if the hamming

Both intra class and inter class comparisons should
have values  that  are  distinct  and  separate  so  that
decisions can be made with high confidence.

Application Hardware: The output of the above process
is given  to  an  intensive  care  unit  door.  The  signal  of
authentication  or  non-authentication  either  opens  or
closes the door respectively.

Implementation in Intensive Care Unit
Intensive Care Unit: Intensive care unit is defined as a
separate,  clearly  designated  service  area  which 
is
maintained  within  a  Hospital  solely  for  the  care  and
treatment  of  patients  who  are  critically  ill.  This  also
includes what is referred to as an acute care unit. 

It  is a specialized  part of  the hospital designed  for
care  of  the  critically  ill  whose  conditions  necessitate
constant  monitoring,  characterized  by  high  quality  and
quantity of continuous nursing and medical supervision
and by use of sophisticated monitoring and resuscitative
equipment.

ICU Security Management: ICU is an integral part of the
hospital  system  and  caters  to  the  needs  of  seriously  ill
patients.  The  category  of  critically  ill  patients  also
encompass patient  who  are  eyewitness  to  some  illegal
activity. The main motto of our project is to secure their
lives, during their recovery period, incase of any life threat
from criminals.

Iris recognition has been used as a tool to give shape
to the above idea. For this project we are using CASIA
database images. But for real time application a camera
can be installed on the ICU door. The authorized person’s
iris image is kept in the database. This will allow him to
access the room on subsequent visits, after his iris pattern
is  matched with  the database. In case any unauthorized
person tries to enter the ICU, his iris pattern has to match
with  the  patterns  stored  in  the  database.  If  there  is a
mismatch  the  person  will  not  be  allowed  to  access  the
room [9].

Future Trends: Iris recognition can be used as the best
option for physical and wireless arenas. 
It can be used in authentication of funds transfer. 
It can be used to provide signature verification. 
Healthcare solutions based on iris recognition can protect
access to patient medical records at hospitals.
