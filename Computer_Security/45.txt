Power Unit 
In every electrical or electronic system, the power unit 
is  the  most  important  part  because  the  overall 
functionality  of  the  system  depends  on  it.  Most 
electronic  devices  make  use  of  direct  current  as 
opposed  to  alternating  current  supplied  by  Power 
Company  which  is  240V  AC  [3].  This  mains supply 
has  to  be  reduced  to  12V  AC  using  a  step  down 
transformer;  and  passed  through  a  bridge  rectifier  to 
be converted to 12V DC and then through a filtering 
capacitor  for  a  smoother  DC  output.  Appropriate 
voltage  regulators  are  then  used  to  get  the  required 
voltage  outputs,  in  this  case  12V  and  5V  voltage 
regulator.  
 

 

The Controller Unit 
The Microcontroller (AT89C52) is known as a single 
integrated  chip  or  device  which  has  features like  the 
Central  Processing  Unit,  memory,  input  and  the 
output  ports  [4].  It  can  also  be  called  a  miniaturized 
computer  in  the  sense  that  it  has  input  and  output 
ports,  the  central  processing  unit,  Random  Access 
Memory (RAM) and the Read Only Memory (ROM). 
It  is  a  programmable  memory  device  which  accepts 
hexadecimal codes and produces an output according 
to  the  instruction  written  in  either  C-language  or 
assembly 
consumes 
relatively  low  power  (milliwatts),  and  will  generally 
have  the  ability  to  “sleep”  while  waiting  for  an 
interesting  peripheral  work [5].  The  specific  features 
of the AT89C52 microcontroller used in this paper are 
as follows:

The  on-chip  flash  allows  the  program  memory  to  be 
reprogrammed 
in-system  or  by  a  conventional 
nonvolatile  memory  programmer.  By  combining  a 
versatile  8bit  CPU  with  in-system  programmable 
flash on  a  monolithic  chip, the  Atmel  AT89C52 is  a 
powerful  microcontroller  which  provides  a  highly 
flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded 
control  applications.  It  is  also  designed  with  a  static 
logic  for  operation  down  to  zero  frequency  and 
supports two software selectable power saving modes. 
The  idle  mode  stops  the  CPU  while  allowing  the 
RAM,  Timer/counters,  serial  port  and  interrupts 
system  to  continue  functioning.  The  power-down 
mode  saves  the  RAM  contents  but  freezes  the 
oscillators, disabling all other chip functions until the 
next external interrupt or hardware reset [7]. 
 
The AT89C52 has 40 pins which is divided into four 
ports used as input/output ports: port 1 (pins 1-8), port 
3(pins 10-17), port 2(pins 21-28), and port 0 (pins 32-
39); with the following special pins: 
i)  Reset  pin  (pin  9):  Upon  applying  a  high  pulse  to 
this  pin,  the  microcontroller  will  reset  and  terminate 
all  activities.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a  power-on 
reset.  Activating  a  power-on  reset  will  cause  all 
values in the registers to be lost. 
ii) XTAL1 and XTAL2 (pins 19 and 18 respectively): 
Used to provide external clock to the microcontroller, 
by  connecting  a  crystal  oscillator  (11.0592MHz) 
across the two pins. The speed of AT89C52 refers to 
the  maximum  oscillator  frequency  connected  to  in 
between XTAL1 andXTAL2. 
iii) VSS (pin 20): Used to ground microcontroller. 
iv) VCC (pin 40):  Use to power the microcontroller, 
+5V. 
v) PSEN (pin 29): It is called Program Store Enable.  
vi) ALE (pin 30): It is called Address Latch Enable. It 
is used for data and address transmission. 
vii) EA (pin 31): It is called External Access pin. It is 
used to read external memory. 
 
 
 

 
Display Unit: 
The type  of display used in this research is the LCD 
which  is  finding  widespread  use  in  replacing  LED. 
This is due to the following reasons: 
i) The declining prices of LCDs. 
ii)  The  ability  to  display  numbers,  character,  and 
graphics. 
iii) Ease of programming for characters and graphics. 
iv) Low power consumption. 
The function of each LCD pin is presented in table 1.

can be developed using 12 push buttons. The keys are 
arranged 
rows  and  columns  equally  and 
adequately spaced. All buttons on a row are connected 
together and linked to one pin of connector, same for 
other  rows.  All  buttons  on  the  same  column  are 
connected together and linked to one pin of connector 
using 10K pull-up resistors; same for other columns. 
The  keypad  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  in

Power Unit 
In every electrical or electronic system, the power unit 
is  the  most  important  part  because  the  overall 
functionality  of  the  system  depends  on  it.  Most 
electronic  devices  make  use  of  direct  current  as 
opposed  to  alternating  current  supplied  by  Power 
Company  which  is  240V  AC  [3].  This  mains supply 
has  to  be  reduced  to  12V  AC  using  a  step  down 
transformer;  and  passed  through  a  bridge  rectifier  to 
be converted to 12V DC and then through a filtering 
capacitor  for  a  smoother  DC  output.  Appropriate 
voltage  regulators  are  then  used  to  get  the  required 
voltage  outputs,  in  this  case  12V  and  5V  voltage 
regulator.  
 

 

The Controller Unit 
The Microcontroller (AT89C52) is known as a single 
integrated  chip  or  device  which  has  features like  the 
Central  Processing  Unit,  memory,  input  and  the 
output  ports  [4].  It  can  also  be  called  a  miniaturized 
computer  in  the  sense  that  it  has  input  and  output 
ports,  the  central  processing  unit,  Random  Access 
Memory (RAM) and the Read Only Memory (ROM). 
It  is  a  programmable  memory  device  which  accepts 
hexadecimal codes and produces an output according 
to  the  instruction  written  in  either  C-language  or 
assembly 
consumes 
relatively  low  power  (milliwatts),  and  will  generally 
have  the  ability  to  “sleep”  while  waiting  for  an 
interesting  peripheral  work [5].  The  specific  features 
of the AT89C52 microcontroller used in this paper are 
as follows: 
 
•  Compatible with MC5-51 products 
• 

language.  Microcontroller 

256 bytes of internal RAM

•  Fully static operation: 0Hz-33MHz 
•

The AT89C52 is a low powered microcontroller, high 
performance  CMOS  8-bit  microcontroller  which  is 
compatible  with 
industry  standard  80C51 
instruction set and pin-out [6].

The  on-chip  flash  allows  the  program  memory  to  be 
reprogrammed 
in-system  or  by  a  conventional 
nonvolatile  memory  programmer.  By  combining  a 
versatile  8bit  CPU  with  in-system  programmable 
flash on  a  monolithic  chip, the  Atmel  AT89C52 is  a 
powerful  microcontroller  which  provides  a  highly 
flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded 
control  applications.  It  is  also  designed  with  a  static 
logic  for  operation  down  to  zero  frequency  and 
supports two software selectable power saving modes. 
The  idle  mode  stops  the  CPU  while  allowing  the 
RAM,  Timer/counters,  serial  port  and  interrupts 
system  to  continue  functioning.  The  power-down 
mode  saves  the  RAM  contents  but  freezes  the 
oscillators, disabling all other chip functions until the 
next external interrupt or hardware reset [7]. 
 
The AT89C52 has 40 pins which is divided into four 
ports used as input/output ports: port 1 (pins 1-8), port 
3(pins 10-17), port 2(pins 21-28), and port 0 (pins 32-
39); with the following special pins: 
i)  Reset  pin  (pin  9):  Upon  applying  a  high  pulse  to 
this  pin,  the  microcontroller  will  reset  and  terminate 
all  activities.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a  power-on 
reset.  Activating  a  power-on  reset  will  cause  all 
values in the registers to be lost. 
ii) XTAL1 and XTAL2 (pins 19 and 18 respectively): 
Used to provide external clock to the microcontroller, 
by  connecting  a  crystal  oscillator  (11.0592MHz) 
across the two pins. The speed of AT89C52 refers to 
the  maximum  oscillator  frequency  connected  to  in 
between XTAL1 andXTAL2. 
iii) VSS (pin 20): Used to ground microcontroller. 
iv) VCC (pin 40):  Use to power the microcontroller, 
+5V. 
v) PSEN (pin 29): It is called Program Store Enable.  
vi) ALE (pin 30): It is called Address Latch Enable. It 
is used for data and address transmission. 
vii) EA (pin 31): It is called External Access pin. It is 
used to read external memory. 
 
 
 

 
Display Unit: 
The type  of display used in this research is the LCD 
which  is  finding  widespread  use  in  replacing  LED. 
This is due to the following reasons: 
i) The declining prices of LCDs. 
ii)  The  ability  to  display  numbers,  character,  and 
graphics. 
iii) Ease of programming for characters and graphics. 
iv) Low power consumption.

Input Unit 
The  input  unit  comprises  of  the  keypad  that  allows 
user  to  interact  with  microcontroller.  A  4x3  keypad 
can be developed using 12 push buttons. The keys are 
arranged 
rows  and  columns  equally  and 
adequately spaced. All buttons on a row are connected 
together and linked to one pin of connector, same for 
other  rows.  All  buttons  on  the  same  column  are 
connected together and linked to one pin of connector 
using 10K pull-up resistors; same for other columns. 
The  keypad  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  in 
rows before the columns, and occupying port 1 of the 
microcontroller. This is shown in figure 2.

2) To transfer a bit to/from EEPROM.

uses a SIM (subscriber identification module) to send

communicates  with  GSM  module  serially,  sending 
time.  It  uses  UART  (universal 
one  bit  at  a 
asynchronous  Receiver 
chip 
transferring data synchronously [9]. The Receive and 
transmit pins are connected to DB9 RS232 connector 
of GSM module through a Line Driver MAX232.  A 
line driver (voltage converter) is needed to convert the 
RS232’s  signals  to  TTL  voltage  levels  that  will  be 
acceptable to 89C52’s TxD and RxD pins. 
The  GSM  module  utilizes  a 
registered  SIM 
(Subscriber  Identifier  Module)  that  connects  to  a 
network provider. The  program codes for interfacing

Abstract- This Paper Presents The Design And Implementation Of A Low Cost Electronic Door Lock System With 
Short  Message  service  (SMS)  alert.  The  system  was  designed  such  that  AT89C52  microcontroller  serves  as  its 
controller which is interfaced to a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module (that enables a GSM 
message or alert to be sent), a liquid crystal display (for display of information), and a keypad (that serves as input 
device where the security code is entered). An SMS alert is sent to a predefined phone number if a wrong password is 
entered for a certain number of times (three times) to inform the home owner of a possible intrusion. The door opens 
automatically when the right code is entered and remains open for 10 seconds before closing. Real-time simulation of 
the system was carried-out using Proteus software. It tested ok and proved to be a reasonable advancement in access 
control and door security system technology. 
 
Key Words: Decoder, GSM module, keypad, Microcontroller, security, SMS. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, home security has been a major issue 
of concern because of the dramatic increase in crime 
rate, and everybody wants to  take proper measure to 
prevent  intrusion  or  unauthorized  entry.  The  main 
reason  for  providing 
locks  for  homes,  offices, 
churches,  schools  and  other  buildings  is  for  security 
of lives and property [1].  
Various  control  systems  have  been  previously 
designed to prevent access to unauthorized users. It is 
therefore 
to  have  a  stress  free  and 
convenient  means  of  achieving  this  purpose  through 
the use of intelligent security door locks. 
 
An  electronic  security  door  lock  with  short  message 
service (SMS) alert uses a GSM module interfaced to 
a microcontroller [2]. A Liquid crystal display (LCD) 
is  used  to  show  the  predefined  password  entered 
through  a  keypad  and  an  alarm  is  activated  when  a 
wrong  code  is  entered  for  a  predefined  number  of 
times.  An  SMS  is  also  sent  to  a  predefined  phone 
number if the wrong password is entered for a certain 
number of times to alert the home owner of a possible 
intrusion.

Microcontroller 
Interfacing a 5V DC Electric Motor to Microcontroller 
is done using a relay. A relay is an electrically operated 
switch,  current  flowing  through  the  coil  of  a  relay 
creates  a  magnetic  field  which  attracts  a  lever  and 
changes the switch contacts. The coil current can be on 
or off; since a relay has two switch positions. 
 
Relay  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  using  two 
NPN  BC547  transistors  because  of  the  different 
voltage  of  operation.  The  relay  works  on  12V  while 
the  microcontroller  and  the  motor  operate  on  5V. 
They act as switches connected to microcontroller and 
operate  when  forward  biased  by  microcontroller  to 
vary direction of motor rotation to open or close door. 
The operation causes one of the relays to change from 
normally closed (grounded) to normally open (VCC) 
or vice versa. Figure 7 shows how the two relays are 
connected to the electric motor for switching on both 
directions.

Abstract- This Paper Presents The Design And Implementation Of A Low Cost Electronic Door Lock System With 
Short  Message  service  (SMS)  alert.  The  system  was  designed  such  that  AT89C52  microcontroller  serves  as  its 
controller which is interfaced to a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module (that enables a GSM 
message or alert to be sent), a liquid crystal display (for display of information), and a keypad (that serves as input 
device where the security code is entered). An SMS alert is sent to a predefined phone number if a wrong password is 
entered for a certain number of times (three times) to inform the home owner of a possible intrusion. The door opens 
automatically when the right code is entered and remains open for 10 seconds before closing. Real-time simulation of 
the system was carried-out using Proteus software. It tested ok and proved to be a reasonable advancement in access 
control and door security system technology.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, home security has been a major issue 
of concern because of the dramatic increase in crime 
rate, and everybody wants to  take proper measure to 
prevent  intrusion  or  unauthorized  entry.  The  main 
reason  for  providing 
locks  for  homes,  offices, 
churches,  schools  and  other  buildings  is  for  security 
of lives and property [1].  
Various  control  systems  have  been  previously 
designed to prevent access to unauthorized users. It is 
therefore 
to  have  a  stress  free  and 
convenient  means  of  achieving  this  purpose  through 
the use of intelligent security door locks. 
 
An  electronic  security  door  lock  with  short  message 
service (SMS) alert uses a GSM module interfaced to 
a microcontroller [2]. A Liquid crystal display (LCD) 
is  used  to  show  the  predefined  password  entered 
through  a  keypad  and  an  alarm  is  activated  when  a 
wrong  code  is  entered  for  a  predefined  number  of 
times.  An  SMS  is  also  sent  to  a  predefined  phone 
number if the wrong password is entered for a certain 
number of times to alert the home owner of a possible 
intrusion.

In general, the block diagram of the system has:

24v/500mA  center  tapped  transformer,  a  smoothing 
capacitor and a voltage regulator.

microcontroller  unit  through  a  DB9  connector  and 
transistor.

Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory 
(EEPROM). 
 
Power Unit 
In every electrical or electronic system, the power unit 
is  the  most  important  part  because  the  overall 
functionality  of  the  system  depends  on  it.  Most 
electronic  devices  make  use  of  direct  current  as 
opposed  to  alternating  current  supplied  by  Power 
Company  which  is  240V  AC  [3].  This  mains supply 
has  to  be  reduced  to  12V  AC  using  a  step  down 
transformer;  and  passed  through  a  bridge  rectifier  to 
be converted to 12V DC and then through a filtering 
capacitor  for  a  smoother  DC  output.  Appropriate 
voltage  regulators  are  then  used  to  get  the  required 
voltage  outputs,  in  this  case  12V  and  5V  voltage 
regulator.  
 

 

The Controller Unit 
The Microcontroller (AT89C52) is known as a single 
integrated  chip  or  device  which  has  features like  the 
Central  Processing  Unit,  memory,  input  and  the 
output  ports  [4].  It  can  also  be  called  a  miniaturized 
computer  in  the  sense  that  it  has  input  and  output 
ports,  the  central  processing  unit,  Random  Access 
Memory (RAM) and the Read Only Memory (ROM). 
It  is  a  programmable  memory  device  which  accepts 
hexadecimal codes and produces an output according 
to  the  instruction  written  in  either  C-language  or 
assembly 
consumes 
relatively  low  power  (milliwatts),  and  will  generally 
have  the  ability  to  “sleep”  while  waiting  for  an 
interesting  peripheral  work [5].  The  specific  features 
of the AT89C52 microcontroller used in this paper are 
as follows: 
 
•  Compatible with MC5-51 products 
• 

language.  Microcontroller 

256 bytes of internal RAM 
32 programmable 1/O lines 

8Kb  of  ROM  in  system  programmable  flash 
memory-endurance: 1000 write/Erase cycle.

• 
•  Fully static operation: 0Hz-33MHz 
• 
• 
•  Six interrupts sources 
•  Full duplex UART serial channel 
•  Fast programmable time  
 
The AT89C52 is a low powered microcontroller, high 
performance  CMOS  8-bit  microcontroller  which  is 
compatible  with 
industry  standard  80C51 
instruction set and pin-out [6].

The  on-chip  flash  allows  the  program  memory  to  be 
reprogrammed 
in-system  or  by  a  conventional 
nonvolatile  memory  programmer.  By  combining  a 
versatile  8bit  CPU  with  in-system  programmable 
flash on  a  monolithic  chip, the  Atmel  AT89C52 is  a 
powerful  microcontroller  which  provides  a  highly 
flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded 
control  applications.  It  is  also  designed  with  a  static 
logic  for  operation  down  to  zero  frequency  and 
supports two software selectable power saving modes. 
The  idle  mode  stops  the  CPU  while  allowing  the 
RAM,  Timer/counters,  serial  port  and  interrupts 
system  to  continue  functioning.  The  power-down 
mode  saves  the  RAM  contents  but  freezes  the 
oscillators, disabling all other chip functions until the 
next external interrupt or hardware reset [7]. 
 
The AT89C52 has 40 pins which is divided into four 
ports used as input/output ports: port 1 (pins 1-8), port 
3(pins 10-17), port 2(pins 21-28), and port 0 (pins 32-
39); with the following special pins: 
i)  Reset  pin  (pin  9):  Upon  applying  a  high  pulse  to 
this  pin,  the  microcontroller  will  reset  and  terminate 
all  activities.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a  power-on 
reset.  Activating  a  power-on  reset  will  cause  all 
values in the registers to be lost. 
ii) XTAL1 and XTAL2 (pins 19 and 18 respectively): 
Used to provide external clock to the microcontroller, 
by  connecting  a  crystal  oscillator  (11.0592MHz) 
across the two pins. The speed of AT89C52 refers to 
the  maximum  oscillator  frequency  connected  to  in 
between XTAL1 andXTAL2. 
iii) VSS (pin 20): Used to ground microcontroller. 
iv) VCC (pin 40):  Use to power the microcontroller, 
+5V. 
v) PSEN (pin 29): It is called Program Store Enable.  
vi) ALE (pin 30): It is called Address Latch Enable. It 
is used for data and address transmission. 
vii) EA (pin 31): It is called External Access pin. It is 
used to read external memory. 
 
 
 

 
Display Unit: 
The type  of display used in this research is the LCD 
which  is  finding  widespread  use  in  replacing  LED. 
This is due to the following reasons: 
i) The declining prices of LCDs. 
ii)  The  ability  to  display  numbers,  character,  and 
graphics. 
iii) Ease of programming for characters and graphics. 
iv) Low power consumption. 
The function of each LCD pin is presented in table 1.

Input Unit 
The  input  unit  comprises  of  the  keypad  that  allows 
user  to  interact  with  microcontroller.  A  4x3  keypad 
can be developed using 12 push buttons. The keys are 
arranged 
rows  and  columns  equally  and 
adequately spaced. All buttons on a row are connected 
together and linked to one pin of connector, same for 
other  rows.  All  buttons  on  the  same  column  are 
connected together and linked to one pin of connector 
using 10K pull-up resistors; same for other columns. 
The  keypad  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  in 
rows before the columns, and occupying port 1 of the 
microcontroller. This is shown in figure 2.

Erasable 
Programmable  Read  Only  Memory.  It  is  a non-
volatile  memory; meaning  that  it  retains  its  content 
even  when  power  is  off.  It  stores  information 
permanently.  The  prime  advantage  of  EEPROM  is 
that  it’s  content  can  be  erased  electrically  and  stores 
new data programmably [8]. There are many kinds of 
EEPROM  devices  that  are  available  from  various 
reputed  manufactures like  ATMEL,  NXP,  Microchip 
etc.  But  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  EEPROM 
24CXX family is 24C01. Figure 3 shows how 24C01 
EEPROM is interfaced to a microcontroller.

Any  read  or  write  operation  in  24C01  requires a 
sequence  of  interaction  with  the  controller.  This 
involves the following steps: 
1) To set Start condition to initiate any Read or Write 
operation. 
2) To transfer a bit to/from EEPROM. 
3)  A  superset  of  these  is  used  to transfer  a  word to/ 
from EEPROM. 
4)  To monitor  acknowledgements for  the  receipt  or 
transfer of each word.   
5)  A  superset  of  signals  for  transferring  words

6)  Setting

Response Unit 
The  Response  unit  consists  of  a  GSM  module  that 
uses a SIM (subscriber identification module) to send 
an  SMS  to  predefined  number.  The  microcontroller 
communicates  with  GSM  module  serially,  sending 
time.  It  uses  UART  (universal 
one  bit  at  a 
asynchronous  Receiver 
chip 
transferring data synchronously [9]. The Receive and 
transmit pins are connected to DB9 RS232 connector 
of GSM module through a Line Driver MAX232.  A 
line driver (voltage converter) is needed to convert the 
RS232’s  signals  to  TTL  voltage  levels  that  will  be 
acceptable to 89C52’s TxD and RxD pins. 
The  GSM  module  utilizes  a 
registered  SIM 
(Subscriber  Identifier  Module)  that  connects  to  a 
network provider. The  program codes for interfacing 
LCD,  keypad  and  GSM  module  to  microcontroller 
were  adequately  developed.  Interfacing  the  GSM 
module

have  the  ability  to  “sleep”  while  waiting  for  an 
interesting  peripheral  work [5].  The  specific  features

The  on-chip  flash  allows  the  program  memory  to  be 
reprogrammed 
in-system  or  by  a  conventional 
nonvolatile  memory  programmer.  By  combining  a 
versatile  8bit  CPU  with  in-system  programmable 
flash on  a  monolithic  chip, the  Atmel  AT89C52 is  a 
powerful  microcontroller  which  provides  a  highly 
flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded 
control  applications.  It  is  also  designed  with  a  static 
logic  for  operation  down  to  zero  frequency  and 
supports two software selectable power saving modes. 
The  idle  mode  stops  the  CPU  while  allowing  the 
RAM,  Timer/counters,  serial  port  and  interrupts 
system  to  continue  functioning.  The  power-down 
mode  saves  the  RAM  contents  but  freezes  the 
oscillators, disabling all other chip functions until the 
next external interrupt or hardware reset [7]. 
 
The AT89C52 has 40 pins which is divided into four 
ports used as input/output ports: port 1 (pins 1-8), port 
3(pins 10-17), port 2(pins 21-28), and port 0 (pins 32-
39); with the following special pins: 
i)  Reset  pin  (pin  9):  Upon  applying  a  high  pulse  to 
this  pin,  the  microcontroller  will  reset  and  terminate 
all  activities.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a  power-on 
reset.  Activating  a  power-on  reset  will  cause  all 
values in the registers to be lost. 
ii) XTAL1 and XTAL2 (pins 19 and 18 respectively): 
Used to provide external clock to the microcontroller, 
by  connecting  a  crystal  oscillator  (11.0592MHz) 
across the two pins. The speed of AT89C52 refers to 
the  maximum  oscillator  frequency  connected  to  in 
between XTAL1 andXTAL2. 
iii) VSS (pin 20): Used to ground microcontroller. 
iv) VCC (pin 40):  Use to power the microcontroller, 
+5V. 
v) PSEN (pin 29): It is called Program Store Enable.  
vi) ALE (pin 30): It is called Address Latch Enable. It 
is used for data and address transmission. 
vii) EA (pin 31): It is called External Access pin. It is 
used to read external memory. 
 
 
 

 
Display Unit: 
The type  of display used in this research is the LCD 
which  is  finding  widespread  use  in  replacing  LED. 
This is due to the following reasons: 
i) The declining prices of LCDs. 
ii)  The  ability  to  display  numbers,  character,  and 
graphics. 
iii) Ease of programming for characters and graphics. 
iv) Low power consumption. 
The function of each LCD pin is presented in table 1.

Input Unit 
The  input  unit  comprises  of  the  keypad  that  allows 
user  to  interact  with  microcontroller.  A  4x3  keypad 
can be developed using 12 push buttons. The keys are 
arranged 
rows  and  columns  equally  and 
adequately spaced. All buttons on a row are connected 
together and linked to one pin of connector, same for 
other  rows.  All  buttons  on  the  same  column  are 
connected together and linked to one pin of connector 
using 10K pull-up resistors; same for other columns. 
The  keypad  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  in 
rows before the columns, and occupying port 1 of the 
microcontroller. This is shown in figure 2.

EEPROM 
Erasable 
Programmable  Read  Only  Memory.  It  is  a non-
volatile  memory; meaning  that  it  retains  its  content 
even  when  power  is  off.  It  stores  information 
permanently.  The  prime  advantage  of  EEPROM  is 
that  it’s  content  can  be  erased  electrically  and  stores 
new data programmably [8]. There are many kinds of 
EEPROM  devices  that  are  available  from  various 
reputed  manufactures like  ATMEL,  NXP,  Microchip 
etc.  But  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  EEPROM 
24CXX family is 24C01. Figure 3 shows how 24C01 
EEPROM is interfaced to a microcontroller.

Any  read  or  write  operation  in  24C01  requires a 
sequence  of  interaction  with  the  controller.  This 
involves the following steps: 
1) To set Start condition to initiate any Read or Write 
operation. 
2) To transfer a bit to/from EEPROM. 
3)  A  superset  of  these  is  used  to transfer  a  word to/ 
from EEPROM. 
4)  To monitor  acknowledgements for  the  receipt  or 
transfer of each word.   
5)  A  superset  of  signals  for  transferring  words

6)  Setting

Response Unit 
The  Response  unit  consists  of  a  GSM  module  that 
uses a SIM (subscriber identification module) to send 
an  SMS  to  predefined  number.  The  microcontroller 
communicates  with  GSM  module  serially,  sending 
time.  It  uses  UART  (universal 
one  bit  at  a 
asynchronous  Receiver 
chip 
transferring data synchronously [9]. The Receive and 
transmit pins are connected to DB9 RS232 connector 
of GSM module through a Line Driver MAX232.  A 
line driver (voltage converter) is needed to convert the 
RS232’s  signals  to  TTL  voltage  levels  that  will  be 
acceptable to 89C52’s TxD and RxD pins. 
The  GSM  module  utilizes  a 
registered  SIM 
(Subscriber  Identifier  Module)  that  connects  to  a 
network provider. The  program codes for interfacing 
LCD,  keypad  and  GSM  module  to  microcontroller 
were  adequately  developed.  Interfacing  the  GSM 
module 
is 
presented in figure 4.

When terminal is turned on, it sends  out signal DTR 
to indicate that it is ready for communication 
DSR (data set  ready): When DCE  is turned on and 
has  gone  through  the  self-test,  it  asserts  DSR  to 
indicate that it is ready to communicate. 
RTS  (request  to  send):  When  the  DTE  device  has 
byte  to  transmit,  it  assert  RTS  to  signal  the  modem 
that it has a byte of data to transmit. 
CTS (clear to send): When the modem has room for 
storing  the  data  it  is  to  receive,  it  sends  out  signal 
CTS  to  DTE  to  indicate  that  it  can  receive  the  data 
now. 
DCD  (data  carrier  detect):  The  modem  asserts 
signal DCD to inform the DTE that a valid carrier has 
been  detected  and  that  contact  between  it  and  the 
other modem is established. 
RI (ring indicator): An output from the modem and 
an  input  to  a  PC  indicates  that  the  telephone  is 
ringing.  It  goes  on  and  off  in  synchronous  with  the 
ringing sound.

Interfacing 
Microcontroller 
Interfacing a 5V DC Electric Motor to Microcontroller 
is done using a relay. A relay is an electrically operated 
switch,  current  flowing  through  the  coil  of  a  relay 
creates  a  magnetic  field  which  attracts  a  lever  and 
changes the switch contacts. The coil current can be on 
or off; since a relay has two switch positions. 
 
Relay  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  using  two 
NPN  BC547  transistors  because  of  the  different 
voltage  of  operation.  The  relay  works  on  12V  while 
the  microcontroller  and  the  motor  operate  on  5V. 
They act as switches connected to microcontroller and 
operate  when  forward  biased  by  microcontroller  to 
vary direction of motor rotation to open or close door. 
The operation causes one of the relays to change from 
normally closed (grounded) to normally open (VCC) 
or vice versa. Figure 7 shows how the two relays are 
connected to the electric motor for switching on both 
directions.

Abstract- This Paper Presents The Design And Implementation Of A Low Cost Electronic Door Lock System With 
Short  Message  service  (SMS)  alert.  The  system  was  designed  such  that  AT89C52  microcontroller  serves  as  its 
controller which is interfaced to a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module (that enables a GSM 
message or alert to be sent), a liquid crystal display (for display of information), and a keypad (that serves as input 
device where the security code is entered). An SMS alert is sent to a predefined phone number if a wrong password is 
entered for a certain number of times (three times) to inform the home owner of a possible intrusion. The door opens 
automatically when the right code is entered and remains open for 10 seconds before closing. Real-time simulation of 
the system was carried-out using Proteus software. It tested ok and proved to be a reasonable advancement in access 
control and door security system technology. 
 
Key Words: Decoder, GSM module, keypad, Microcontroller, security, SMS. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, home security has been a major issue 
of concern because of the dramatic increase in crime 
rate, and everybody wants to  take proper measure to 
prevent  intrusion  or  unauthorized  entry.  The  main 
reason  for  providing 
locks  for  homes,  offices, 
churches,  schools  and  other  buildings  is  for  security 
of lives and property [1].  
Various  control  systems  have  been  previously 
designed to prevent access to unauthorized users. It is 
therefore 
to  have  a  stress  free  and 
convenient  means  of  achieving  this  purpose  through 
the use of intelligent security door locks. 
 
An  electronic  security  door  lock  with  short  message 
service (SMS) alert uses a GSM module interfaced to 
a microcontroller [2]. A Liquid crystal display (LCD) 
is  used  to  show  the  predefined  password  entered 
through  a  keypad  and  an  alarm  is  activated  when  a 
wrong  code  is  entered  for  a  predefined  number  of 
times.  An  SMS  is  also  sent  to  a  predefined  phone 
number if the wrong password is entered for a certain 
number of times to alert the home owner of a possible 
intrusion.

In general, the block diagram of the system has: 
i)  the  Power  Supply  Unit  which  is  built  using  a 
24v/500mA  center  tapped  transformer,  a  smoothing 
capacitor and a voltage regulator. 
ii)  the  Input  Unit  which  is  basically  a  4x3  matrix 
keypad constructed with push buttons. 
iii)  the  Display  Unit  which  is  a  16X2  LCD  display 
with backlight 
iv) 
the  Control  Unit  which  consists  of  a 
microcontroller in which the control program is burnt 
into its ROM 
v)  the  Response  Unit  which  consists  of  a  GSM 
module  and  an  electric  motor  interfaced  to  the  
microcontroller  unit  through  a  DB9  connector  and 
transistor. 
vi) the Memory Unit which is basically an Electrically 
Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory 
(EEPROM). 
 
Power Unit 
In every electrical or electronic system, the power unit 
is  the  most  important  part  because  the  overall 
functionality  of  the  system  depends  on  it.  Most 
electronic  devices  make  use  of  direct  current  as 
opposed  to  alternating  current  supplied  by  Power 
Company  which  is  240V  AC  [3].  This  mains supply 
has  to  be  reduced  to  12V  AC  using  a  step  down 
transformer;  and  passed  through  a  bridge  rectifier  to 
be converted to 12V DC and then through a filtering 
capacitor  for  a  smoother  DC  output.  Appropriate 
voltage  regulators  are  then  used  to  get  the  required 
voltage  outputs,  in  this  case  12V  and  5V  voltage 
regulator.  
 

 

The Controller Unit 
The Microcontroller (AT89C52) is known as a single 
integrated  chip  or  device  which  has  features like  the 
Central  Processing  Unit,  memory,  input  and  the 
output  ports  [4].  It  can  also  be  called  a  miniaturized 
computer  in  the  sense  that  it  has  input  and  output 
ports,  the  central  processing  unit,  Random  Access 
Memory (RAM) and the Read Only Memory (ROM). 
It  is  a  programmable  memory  device  which  accepts 
hexadecimal codes and produces an output according 
to  the  instruction  written  in  either  C-language  or 
assembly 
consumes 
relatively  low  power  (milliwatts),  and  will  generally 
have  the  ability  to  “sleep”  while  waiting  for  an 
interesting  peripheral  work [5].  The  specific  features 
of the AT89C52 microcontroller used in this paper are 
as follows: 
 
•  Compatible with MC5-51 products 
•

The AT89C52 is a low powered microcontroller, high 
performance  CMOS  8-bit  microcontroller  which  is 
compatible  with 
industry  standard  80C51 
instruction set and pin-out [6].

The  on-chip  flash  allows  the  program  memory  to  be 
reprogrammed 
in-system  or  by  a  conventional 
nonvolatile  memory  programmer.  By  combining  a 
versatile  8bit  CPU  with  in-system  programmable 
flash on  a  monolithic  chip, the  Atmel  AT89C52 is  a 
powerful  microcontroller  which  provides  a  highly 
flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded 
control  applications.  It  is  also  designed  with  a  static 
logic  for  operation  down  to  zero  frequency  and 
supports two software selectable power saving modes. 
The  idle  mode  stops  the  CPU  while  allowing  the 
RAM,  Timer/counters,  serial  port  and  interrupts 
system  to  continue  functioning.  The  power-down 
mode  saves  the  RAM  contents  but  freezes  the 
oscillators, disabling all other chip functions until the 
next external interrupt or hardware reset [7]. 
 
The AT89C52 has 40 pins which is divided into four 
ports used as input/output ports: port 1 (pins 1-8), port 
3(pins 10-17), port 2(pins 21-28), and port 0 (pins 32-
39); with the following special pins: 
i)  Reset  pin  (pin  9):  Upon  applying  a  high  pulse  to 
this  pin,  the  microcontroller  will  reset  and  terminate 
all  activities.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a  power-on 
reset.  Activating  a  power-on  reset  will  cause  all 
values in the registers to be lost. 
ii) XTAL1 and XTAL2 (pins 19 and 18 respectively): 
Used to provide external clock to the microcontroller, 
by  connecting  a  crystal  oscillator  (11.0592MHz) 
across the two pins. The speed of AT89C52 refers to 
the  maximum  oscillator  frequency  connected  to  in 
between XTAL1 andXTAL2. 
iii) VSS (pin 20): Used to ground microcontroller. 
iv) VCC (pin 40):  Use to power the microcontroller, 
+5V. 
v) PSEN (pin 29): It is called Program Store Enable.  
vi) ALE (pin 30): It is called Address Latch Enable. It 
is used for data and address transmission. 
vii) EA (pin 31): It is called External Access pin. It is 
used to read external memory. 
 
 
 

 
Display Unit: 
The type  of display used in this research is the LCD 
which  is  finding  widespread  use  in  replacing  LED. 
This is due to the following reasons: 
i) The declining prices of LCDs. 
ii)  The  ability  to  display  numbers,  character,  and 
graphics. 
iii) Ease of programming for characters and graphics. 
iv) Low power consumption. 
The function of each LCD pin is presented in table 1.

Input Unit 
The  input  unit  comprises  of  the  keypad  that  allows 
user  to  interact  with  microcontroller.  A  4x3  keypad 
can be developed using 12 push buttons. The keys are 
arranged 
rows  and  columns  equally  and 
adequately spaced. All buttons on a row are connected 
together and linked to one pin of connector, same for 
other  rows.  All  buttons  on  the  same  column  are 
connected together and linked to one pin of connector 
using 10K pull-up resistors; same for other columns. 
The  keypad  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  in 
rows before the columns, and occupying port 1 of the 
microcontroller. This is shown in figure 2.

Memory Unit  
EEPROM 
Erasable 
Programmable  Read  Only  Memory.  It  is  a non-
volatile  memory; meaning  that  it  retains  its  content 
even  when  power  is  off.  It  stores  information 
permanently.  The  prime  advantage  of  EEPROM  is 
that  it’s  content  can  be  erased  electrically  and  stores 
new data programmably [8]. There are many kinds of 
EEPROM  devices  that  are  available  from  various 
reputed  manufactures like  ATMEL,  NXP,  Microchip 
etc.  But  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  EEPROM 
24CXX family is 24C01. Figure 3 shows how 24C01 
EEPROM is interfaced to a microcontroller.

Any  read  or  write  operation  in  24C01  requires a 
sequence  of  interaction  with  the  controller.  This 
involves the following steps: 
1) To set Start condition to initiate any Read or Write 
operation. 
2) To transfer a bit to/from EEPROM. 
3)  A  superset  of  these  is  used  to transfer  a  word to/ 
from EEPROM. 
4)  To monitor  acknowledgements for  the  receipt  or 
transfer of each word.   
5)  A  superset  of  signals  for  transferring  words 
perform Read or Write operations. 
6)  Setting 
operation. 
 
Response Unit 
The  Response  unit  consists  of  a  GSM  module  that 
uses a SIM (subscriber identification module) to send 
an  SMS  to  predefined  number.  The  microcontroller 
communicates  with  GSM  module  serially,  sending 
time.  It  uses  UART  (universal 
one  bit  at  a 
asynchronous  Receiver 
chip 
transferring data synchronously [9]. The Receive and 
transmit pins are connected to DB9 RS232 connector 
of GSM module through a Line Driver MAX232.  A 
line driver (voltage converter) is needed to convert the 
RS232’s  signals  to  TTL  voltage  levels  that  will  be 
acceptable to 89C52’s TxD and RxD pins. 
The  GSM  module  utilizes  a 
registered  SIM 
(Subscriber  Identifier  Module)  that  connects  to  a 
network provider. The  program codes for interfacing 
LCD,  keypad  and  GSM  module  to  microcontroller 
were  adequately  developed.  Interfacing  the  GSM 
module 
is 
presented in figure 4.

DTR (data terminal ready) 
When terminal is turned on, it sends  out signal DTR 
to indicate that it is ready for communication 
DSR (data set  ready): When DCE  is turned on and 
has  gone  through  the  self-test,  it  asserts  DSR  to 
indicate that it is ready to communicate. 
RTS  (request  to  send):  When  the  DTE  device  has 
byte  to  transmit,  it  assert  RTS  to  signal  the  modem 
that it has a byte of data to transmit. 
CTS (clear to send): When the modem has room for 
storing  the  data  it  is  to  receive,  it  sends  out  signal 
CTS  to  DTE  to  indicate  that  it  can  receive  the  data 
now. 
DCD  (data  carrier  detect):  The  modem  asserts 
signal DCD to inform the DTE that a valid carrier has 
been  detected  and  that  contact  between  it  and  the 
other modem is established. 
RI (ring indicator): An output from the modem and 
an  input  to  a  PC  indicates  that  the  telephone  is 
ringing.  It  goes  on  and  off  in  synchronous  with  the 
ringing sound.

Interfacing 
Microcontroller 
Interfacing a 5V DC Electric Motor to Microcontroller 
is done using a relay. A relay is an electrically operated 
switch,  current  flowing  through  the  coil  of  a  relay 
creates  a  magnetic  field  which  attracts  a  lever  and 
changes the switch contacts. The coil current can be on 
or off; since a relay has two switch positions. 
 
Relay  is  interfaced  to  the  microcontroller  using  two 
NPN  BC547  transistors  because  of  the  different 
voltage  of  operation.  The  relay  works  on  12V  while 
the  microcontroller  and  the  motor  operate  on  5V. 
They act as switches connected to microcontroller and 
operate  when  forward  biased  by  microcontroller  to 
vary direction of motor rotation to open or close door. 
The operation causes one of the relays to change from 
normally closed (grounded) to normally open (VCC) 
or vice versa. Figure 7 shows how the two relays are 
connected to the electric motor for switching on both 
directions.

4. CONCLUSION 
This research involves the design and implementation 
of an electronic security door lock with SMS alert.  It 
uses  an  AT89C52  microcontroller  as  the  controller 
unit,  in  which  a  program  written  in  Assembly 
language  is  burnt  into  it  in  order  that  a  door  control 
application is achieved. It was powered using 5V Dc 
rectified  and  regulated  by  a  12-0-12v/500mA  AC 
center  tapped  transformer.  A  SIM900  GSM  module 
was 
through 
MAX232  line  driver  and  a  DB9  connector  for  SMS 
alert. This module was powered by a 12V adapter.  A 
4  x3  matrix  keypad  was  used  as  input  and  a  2x16 
character  LCD  HD44780  controller  was  used  as  a 
display  unit  powered  by  a  5V  DC.  A  5V  DC  motor 
was used to drive lock mechanism to lock or  unlock 
the door. A 5V DC-12V DC buzzer was interfaced to 
the  microcontroller  using  an  NPN  transistor  to  be 
activated  when  wrong  password 
is  entered  a 
predefined  number  of  times,  a  GSM  module  would 
also send an SMS to a predefined number.  
 
When  a  predefined  number  (right  password)  is 
entered  on  the  keypad  located  at  the  entrance  of  the 
door,  the  door  will  open  automatically  since  the 
password 
the 
microcontroller;  and  the  door  remains  open  for  10 
seconds as programmed. The number pressed will be 
seen on the LCD. The system was designed such that 
when  a  wrong  password  is  entered,  the  door  is  not 
opened.  And  if  the  wrong  password  is  entered  for 
three  times,  an  alarm  is  activated  and  the  GSM 
module  sends  an  SMS  alert  to  a  predefined  phone 
number  of  the  house  owner.  The  design  has  been 
proved  to  be  a  reasonable  advancement  in  access 
control and door security system technology.
