Abstract— Golle et al. proposed a universal re-encryption scheme for mix-net in RSA2004. In
case of re-encryption, this universal re-encryption does not need a public key, but just uses a random
encryption factor. Therefore, the decryption is very simple than that of other re-encryption schemes.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to e-voting system and RFID system which have
recently received a lot of attention for privacy and security with the advantage of the universal re-
encryption. Furthermore, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting system and RFID system. In
case of e-voting based on the universal re-encryption, it can take the eﬀective computational complexity
because the decryption for the counting of voting contents is possible at once. But, it needs the
requirement that the tallier is a trusted party. In case of RFID system, a consumer
s privacy can be
infringed by a strong tracing ability. Although ID of a RFID tag can be encrypted, it is possible to
pursue an object by tracing speciﬁc information. We discuss security and privacy of e-voting system
and RFID system using the universal re-encryption.

1.1 Motivation

Many e-voting systems have been proposed for se-
cure on-line voting [?, ?, ?]. A few systems of these are
used in real election. But, e-voting system is controver-
sial recent topic. The recent topics of e-voting system
are receipt-freeness and universal veriﬁability. Receipt-
freeness means that a voter can not construct a receipt
to provide the content of his vote. Universal veriﬁa-
bility means that anyone can verify a correctness of
election. Sako and Killian[?] proposed e-voting system
based on a mix-net to solve receipt-freeness and univer-
sal veriﬁability. A mix-net was proposed by Chaum[?].
A mix-net is used to apply many applications as anony-
mous channel. A mix-net takes a list of ciphertexts
of users and outputs a permuted list of the plaintexts
without revealing the relationship between and . Gen-
erally, a mix-net provides anonymity, privacy, and ro-
bustness as follows.
- Privacy : The messages are sent anonymously.
- Anonymity : Anyone should not know the relation
between a sender and his message.
- Robustness: Although one mix-centers is stopped,
it should not aﬀect an entire system.
- Individual Veriﬁability : A sender has to check
whether or not his message has reached to its destina-
tion.

Michels and Horster [?] pointed out that Sako-Killian s
scheme has problems of privacy and robustness. These
problems give rise to a serious loss on voting system.
Golle et al.[?] proposed a universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique that permits the universal re-encryption
of ciphertexts. Like standard re-encryption, the uni-
versal re-encryption transforms a ciphertext into a new
ciphertext with same corresponding plaintext. More-
over, they proposed a mix-net based on their universal
re-encryption.

A Radio-Frequency-Identiﬁcation (RFID) tag is a
small and inexpensive device that consists of an IC chip
and an antenna which communicate by radio frequency.
A radio communication device called as a reader emits
a query to RFID tags and reads their ID. Some read-
ers also transmit power to RFID tags when they emit
a query.
In this case, RFID tags do not have power
supply. Therefore RFID tags are expected to be used
as a substitute for a bar code in the future [?, ?, ?, ?].
In order to use as a bar code, the cost of RFID tags is
0.05$/unit, and tags are small as 0.4mm 0.4mm and
thin enough to be embedded in the papers [?, ?]. For
this reason, the processing capacity of a RFID tag is
limited. The RFID system using this tag and a reader
is used for the automobile object identiﬁcation. Since
the goods attached the RFID tags in a cardboard box
can be checked even if the box is not opened, so it is
used for management of goods[?, ?]. A RFID tag is
attached to goods, and it is expected that its function
like a bar code is achieved and it is useful to theft de-
tection. Moreover, after goods are purchased, a RFID
system gives a useful function for a consumer. For ex-
ample, a refrigerator with the reader will be able to

to oﬀer a few of the enticing possibilities of its con-

has proposed to embedded RFID tags in Euro ban-
knotes [?]. By using identiﬁcation combined ID on
RFID tags and serial number printed on banknotes, it
is expected to prevent
forgery or money laundering.
The communication between a reader and a RFID tag
is performed by radio. So it is simply tapped by an at-
tacker. The reader can simply derive information from
the RFID tag and it can be used to infringement of the
privacy [?, ?]. Since the RFID tag has unique ID, if the
attacker obtains the ID, he can get the information on
the object that the tag was attached. For example, the
size and the price of clothes, the contents of a wallet,
the inventory information on the goods of a store etc.
can be leaked. As a result, it infringes on the owner
s privacy. Moreover, the location of the owner can be
traced by tracing the information on the speciﬁc RFID
tag even if the attacker cannot understand the contents
of ID. This privacy about owner
s location is called
as location privacy [?]. For this reason, there are some
problems such as a retail store pursues a consumer and
the circulation information on goods is revealed.

1.2 Related works

As above mentioned, many schemes for secure e-
voting system have been proposed. Fujioka, Okamoto
and Ohta [?] proposed a practical secret voting scheme
for large scale elections based on blind signature and
bit-commitment. Ohkubo et al.[?] upgraded the e-
voting scheme of [?] through threshold encryption in-
stead of bit-commitment scheme. Benaloh and Tuin-
stra [?] proposed the ﬁrst receipt-free scheme for e-
voting system. They put physically guarantees secret
communication, as a voting booth, between the au-
thorities and each voter. Sako and Kilian [?] proposed
receipt-free voting protocol based on a mix-net channel.
They assumed the existence of one-way secret commu-
nication, as an untappable private channel, between
each authority and each voter. The important disad-
vantage of this scheme is that heavy cost load can be
happened in tallying because of mix-net scheme [?].
Hirt and Sako[?] introduced the eﬃcient receipt-free
voting based on homomorphic encryption. To achieve
a receipt-freeness, they used schemes of [?] and [?].
Jakobsson[?] proposed a practical mix to achieve pri-
vacy, robustness, and veriﬁability in 1998. He used
Blinding I, Blinding II, Unblinding I and Unblinding II.
Desmedt and Kurosawa [?] showed an attack such that
at least one malicious mix-centers can prevent comput-
ing the correct output. And, Jakobsson [?] proposed a
ﬂash mix-net to achieve privacy, robustness and veriﬁ-
ability. His mix-net consists of blinding protocol and
unblinding protocol using two dummy elements which
are inserted into the input list at the beginning of the
protocol in ﬂash mix. The blinding protocol consists
of the ﬁrst re-encryption and the second re-encryption.
Mitomo and Kurosawa [?] showed the attack method
of Jokobsson s ﬂash mix under the condition which at
most among mix-centers and at most among senders is
malicious.

Also, since the communication between a RFID tag
and a reader is monitored simply, it applies encryp-
tion to the communication, or uses authentication an
owner or a speciﬁc reader [?]. Since the reader
s ca-
pability is not restricted, the reader can encrypt the
contents of a RFID tag. However, since the cost of a
RFID tag is cheap, the RFID tag has only the limited
processing capability. Moreover it is possible that the
communication between a RFID tag and a reader is
intercepted. Therefore, it is diﬃcult for the RFID tag
to authenticate the speciﬁc reader. In addition to en-
crypt the information on the RFID tag, there is an ap-
proach of re-encrypting the encrypted information on
the RFID tag periodically [?]. Re-encryption means
encrypting a ciphertext again. It is performed by us-
ing public key cryptography. Even if a ciphertext is
re-encrypted repeatedly, we can obtain the plaintext
by decrypting only once with using a private key. By
using symmetric key cryptography, we must decrypt
the re-encrypted ciphertext many times or the reader
has to synchronize with the RFID tag. Moreover, if re-
encryption has the property of semantic security, it is
diﬃcult for an attacker to get the original cipher-text
from the re-encrypted ciphertext [?]. Since the infor-
mation on a RFID tag is changed by re-encryption, it
can prevent from tracing the information on the spe-
ciﬁc RFID tag. Moreover, if the reader processes re-
encryption, a RFID tag does not need carry out com-
plicated processing. However, if a reader processes re-
encryption with a public key, the owner has to deliver
information about the public key for the reader in case
of re-encryption. In that case, the attacker will be pos-
sible to trace the RFID tag relevant to the public key
[?]. Although you may consider making the RFID tag
itself process re-encryption, it is diﬃcult for the RFID
tag to process re-encryption because its processing ca-
pability is restricted.

1.3 Our Contribution

We apply the universal re-encryption public tech-
nique for a mix-net which is proposed by Golle et al.
to an e-voting system and an RFID system. For the
re-encryption, this universal re-encryption uses just a
random encryption factor, not a public key. Therefore,
the application system based on the can get the eﬀec-
tive communication complexity in the decryption stage.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to
e-voting system and RFID system which have recently
received a lot of attention for privacy and security with
the advantage of the universal re-encryption. Further-
more, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting
system and RFID system based on the universal re-
encryption. Our e-voting system and RFID system
consist of each three kinds of participants as follows.
E-voting system : A voter, Mix-centers, Tallier
RFID system : IC tag, Readers, Database
A voter and IC tags play a role as a sender, and mix-
centers and readers are mixing-center to shuﬄe the re-
ceived data. Tallier and database are authorities to
decrypt. Then, mix-centers and readers satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and untraceability for secure e-voting system

We apply the universal re-encryption public tech-

to an e-voting system and an RFID system. For the
re-encryption, this universal re-encryption uses just a
random encryption factor, not a public key. Therefore,
the application system based on the can get the eﬀec-

In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to
e-voting system and RFID system which have recently
received a lot of attention for privacy and security with
the advantage of the universal re-encryption. Further-
more, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting
system and RFID system based on the universal re-
encryption. Our e-voting system and RFID system
consist of each three kinds of participants as follows.
E-voting system : A voter, Mix-centers, Tallier
RFID system : IC tag, Readers, Database
A voter and IC tags play a role as a sender, and mix-
centers and readers are mixing-center to shuﬄe the re-
ceived data. Tallier and database are authorities to
decrypt. Then, mix-centers and readers satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and untraceability for secure e-voting system

and RFID system. The tallier of an e-voting system
satisﬁes untraceability, not conﬁdentiality. If the tal-
lier satisﬁes conﬁdentiality, he can trace a voter
s ID.
Therefore, it can be happened the privacy of a voter.
Also, the database of RFID system does not satisfy
conﬁdentiality and untraceability to protect the secu-
rity of IC tag from the readers.

red When we apply the universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique to the e-voting system and RFID system,
the tallier of the e-voting system does not satisfy un-
traceability. This problem is caused by the original
the universal re-encryption public technique. The uni-
versal re-encryption public technique guarantees only
external anonymity. But, if the tallier is a trust party
and should not collude with other participant, the pri-
vacy of a voter can be guaranteed. Moreover, our
e-voting system based on the unviersal re-encryption
public technique has the excellent computational cost
than other e-voting systems based on a mix-net scheme
like table 1.

2 The universal re-encryption for Mix-

net and Security Analysis

2.1 The universal re-encryption for Mix-net

The outline of Golle et al. s the universal re-encryption

for mix-net is as follows.
- Every input to the mix-net is encrypted under the
public key of the recipient for whom it is intended.
- Thus, unlike standard re-encryption mix-net, univer-
sal mix-net accepts ciphertexts encrypted under the in-
dividual public keys of receivers, rather than encrypted
the unique public key of the mix network.
- The output of universal mix-net is a set of cipher-
texts.
- Recipients can retrieve from the set of output cipher-
texts those addressed to them, and decrypt them.
Key generation (UKG) Output (PK,SK)= (y =
gx, x) for x ∈U Zq.
Encryption (UE) Input comprises a message m, a
public key y, and a random encryption factor r =
(k0, k1) ∈ Z 2
q . The output is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] = [(myk0 , gk0); (yk1 , gk1)].
We write C = U EP K(m, r) or C = U EP K(m) for
brevity.
Decryption (UD) Input is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] under public key y. Verify α0, β0, α1, β1 ∈ g
; if not, the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output. Compute m0 = α0/βx

If m1 = 1, then the output is m = m0. Otherwise,
the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output.
Note that this ensures a binding between ciphertexts
and keys: a given ciphertext can be decrypted only un-
der one given key.

mix the concept of the bulletin board. This involves
two operations : (1) The server re-encrypts all the uni-
versal ciphertexts on the bulletin board using URe,
and (2) The server writes the resulting new ciphertexts
back to the bulletin board in random order, overwrit-
ing the old ones. It is also desirable that a mix server
be able to prove that it operated correctly.

2.2 Security Analysis

The advantages of the universal re-encryption are as

follows.
- Can be done without knowledge of public keys.
- Construct a mix-net of this kind in which servers hold
no public or private keying material.
- Half as eﬃcient as standard ElGamal encryption.
The main properties of universal mix-net are as follows.
- Universal mix-net holds no keying material.
- Universal mix-net guarantees forward anonymity.
- Universal mix-net does not support escrow capability.
In the universal re-encryption mix-net, if a malicious
mix-server St selects kt
1, a coercer can know the
inputs from the outputs of St as follows.
Input :

0 = kt

C t−1 = [(αt−1

Output :

Then, a coercer can get parts of C (t − 1) from C t as
follows.

But, if only one mix-center among mix-centers is trust,
privacy, anonymous and robustness are guaranteed. Only,

Security and Privacy in E-voting and RFID System Based on

Universal Re-encryption Mix-net

Abstract— Golle et al. proposed a universal re-encryption scheme for mix-net in RSA2004. In
case of re-encryption, this universal re-encryption does not need a public key, but just uses a random
encryption factor. Therefore, the decryption is very simple than that of other re-encryption schemes.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to e-voting system and RFID system which have
recently received a lot of attention for privacy and security with the advantage of the universal re-
encryption. Furthermore, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting system and RFID system. In
case of e-voting based on the universal re-encryption, it can take the eﬀective computational complexity
because the decryption for the counting of voting contents is possible at once. But, it needs the
requirement that the tallier is a trusted party. In case of RFID system, a consumer
s privacy can be
infringed by a strong tracing ability. Although ID of a RFID tag can be encrypted, it is possible to
pursue an object by tracing speciﬁc information. We discuss security and privacy of e-voting system
and RFID system using the universal re-encryption.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Many e-voting systems have been proposed for se-
cure on-line voting [?, ?, ?]. A few systems of these are
used in real election. But, e-voting system is controver-
sial recent topic. The recent topics of e-voting system
are receipt-freeness and universal veriﬁability. Receipt-
freeness means that a voter can not construct a receipt
to provide the content of his vote. Universal veriﬁa-
bility means that anyone can verify a correctness of
election. Sako and Killian[?] proposed e-voting system
based on a mix-net to solve receipt-freeness and univer-
sal veriﬁability. A mix-net was proposed by Chaum[?].
A mix-net is used to apply many applications as anony-
mous channel. A mix-net takes a list of ciphertexts
of users and outputs a permuted list of the plaintexts
without revealing the relationship between and . Gen-
erally, a mix-net provides anonymity, privacy, and ro-
bustness as follows.
- Privacy : The messages are sent anonymously.
- Anonymity : Anyone should not know the relation
between a sender and his message.
- Robustness: Although one mix-centers is stopped,
it should not aﬀect an entire system.
- Individual Veriﬁability : A sender has to check
whether or not his message has reached to its destina-
tion.

Michels and Horster [?] pointed out that Sako-Killian s
scheme has problems of privacy and robustness. These
problems give rise to a serious loss on voting system.
Golle et al.[?] proposed a universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique that permits the universal re-encryption
of ciphertexts. Like standard re-encryption, the uni-
versal re-encryption transforms a ciphertext into a new
ciphertext with same corresponding plaintext. More-
over, they proposed a mix-net based on their universal
re-encryption.

A Radio-Frequency-Identiﬁcation (RFID) tag is a
small and inexpensive device that consists of an IC chip
and an antenna which communicate by radio frequency.
A radio communication device called as a reader emits
a query to RFID tags and reads their ID. Some read-
ers also transmit power to RFID tags when they emit
a query.
In this case, RFID tags do not have power
supply. Therefore RFID tags are expected to be used
as a substitute for a bar code in the future [?, ?, ?, ?].
In order to use as a bar code, the cost of RFID tags is
0.05$/unit, and tags are small as 0.4mm 0.4mm and
thin enough to be embedded in the papers [?, ?]. For
this reason, the processing capacity of a RFID tag is
limited. The RFID system using this tag and a reader
is used for the automobile object identiﬁcation. Since
the goods attached the RFID tags in a cardboard box
can be checked even if the box is not opened, so it is
used for management of goods[?, ?]. A RFID tag is
attached to goods, and it is expected that its function
like a bar code is achieved and it is useful to theft de-
tection. Moreover, after goods are purchased, a RFID
system gives a useful function for a consumer. For ex-
ample, a refrigerator with the reader will be able to
recognize expired food-stuﬀs, and a closet will be able

to oﬀer a few of the enticing possibilities of its con-
tents [?]. Moreover the European Central Bank (ECB)
has proposed to embedded RFID tags in Euro ban-
knotes [?]. By using identiﬁcation combined ID on
RFID tags and serial number printed on banknotes, it
is expected to prevent
forgery or money laundering.
The communication between a reader and a RFID tag
is performed by radio. So it is simply tapped by an at-
tacker. The reader can simply derive information from
the RFID tag and it can be used to infringement of the
privacy [?, ?]. Since the RFID tag has unique ID, if the
attacker obtains the ID, he can get the information on
the object that the tag was attached. For example, the
size and the price of clothes, the contents of a wallet,
the inventory information on the goods of a store etc.
can be leaked. As a result, it infringes on the owner
s privacy. Moreover, the location of the owner can be
traced by tracing the information on the speciﬁc RFID
tag even if the attacker cannot understand the contents
of ID. This privacy about owner
s location is called
as location privacy [?]. For this reason, there are some
problems such as a retail store pursues a consumer and
the circulation information on goods is revealed.

1.2 Related works

As above mentioned, many schemes for secure e-
voting system have been proposed. Fujioka, Okamoto
and Ohta [?] proposed a practical secret voting scheme
for large scale elections based on blind signature and
bit-commitment. Ohkubo et al.[?] upgraded the e-
voting scheme of [?] through threshold encryption in-
stead of bit-commitment scheme. Benaloh and Tuin-
stra [?] proposed the ﬁrst receipt-free scheme for e-
voting system. They put physically guarantees secret
communication, as a voting booth, between the au-
thorities and each voter. Sako and Kilian [?] proposed
receipt-free voting protocol based on a mix-net channel.
They assumed the existence of one-way secret commu-
nication, as an untappable private channel, between
each authority and each voter. The important disad-
vantage of this scheme is that heavy cost load can be
happened in tallying because of mix-net scheme [?].
Hirt and Sako[?] introduced the eﬃcient receipt-free
voting based on homomorphic encryption. To achieve
a receipt-freeness, they used schemes of [?] and [?].
Jakobsson[?] proposed a practical mix to achieve pri-
vacy, robustness, and veriﬁability in 1998. He used
Blinding I, Blinding II, Unblinding I and Unblinding II.
Desmedt and Kurosawa [?] showed an attack such that
at least one malicious mix-centers can prevent comput-
ing the correct output. And, Jakobsson [?] proposed a
ﬂash mix-net to achieve privacy, robustness and veriﬁ-
ability. His mix-net consists of blinding protocol and
unblinding protocol using two dummy elements which
are inserted into the input list at the beginning of the
protocol in ﬂash mix. The blinding protocol consists
of the ﬁrst re-encryption and the second re-encryption.
Mitomo and Kurosawa [?] showed the attack method
of Jokobsson s ﬂash mix under the condition which at
most among mix-centers and at most among senders is
malicious.

Also, since the communication between a RFID tag
and a reader is monitored simply, it applies encryp-
tion to the communication, or uses authentication an
owner or a speciﬁc reader [?]. Since the reader
s ca-
pability is not restricted, the reader can encrypt the
contents of a RFID tag. However, since the cost of a
RFID tag is cheap, the RFID tag has only the limited
processing capability. Moreover it is possible that the
communication between a RFID tag and a reader is
intercepted. Therefore, it is diﬃcult for the RFID tag
to authenticate the speciﬁc reader. In addition to en-
crypt the information on the RFID tag, there is an ap-
proach of re-encrypting the encrypted information on
the RFID tag periodically [?]. Re-encryption means
encrypting a ciphertext again. It is performed by us-
ing public key cryptography. Even if a ciphertext is
re-encrypted repeatedly, we can obtain the plaintext
by decrypting only once with using a private key. By
using symmetric key cryptography, we must decrypt
the re-encrypted ciphertext many times or the reader
has to synchronize with the RFID tag. Moreover, if re-
encryption has the property of semantic security, it is
diﬃcult for an attacker to get the original cipher-text
from the re-encrypted ciphertext [?]. Since the infor-
mation on a RFID tag is changed by re-encryption, it
can prevent from tracing the information on the spe-
ciﬁc RFID tag. Moreover, if the reader processes re-
encryption, a RFID tag does not need carry out com-
plicated processing. However, if a reader processes re-
encryption with a public key, the owner has to deliver
information about the public key for the reader in case
of re-encryption. In that case, the attacker will be pos-
sible to trace the RFID tag relevant to the public key
[?]. Although you may consider making the RFID tag
itself process re-encryption, it is diﬃcult for the RFID
tag to process re-encryption because its processing ca-
pability is restricted.

1.3 Our Contribution

We apply the universal re-encryption public tech-
nique for a mix-net which is proposed by Golle et al.
to an e-voting system and an RFID system. For the
re-encryption, this universal re-encryption uses just a
random encryption factor, not a public key. Therefore,
the application system based on the can get the eﬀec-
tive communication complexity in the decryption stage.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to
e-voting system and RFID system which have recently
received a lot of attention for privacy and security with
the advantage of the universal re-encryption. Further-
more, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting
system and RFID system based on the universal re-
encryption. Our e-voting system and RFID system
consist of each three kinds of participants as follows.
E-voting system : A voter, Mix-centers, Tallier
RFID system : IC tag, Readers, Database
A voter and IC tags play a role as a sender, and mix-
centers and readers are mixing-center to shuﬄe the re-
ceived data. Tallier and database are authorities to
decrypt. Then, mix-centers and readers satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and untraceability for secure e-voting system

and RFID system. The tallier of an e-voting system
satisﬁes untraceability, not conﬁdentiality. If the tal-
lier satisﬁes conﬁdentiality, he can trace a voter
s ID.
Therefore, it can be happened the privacy of a voter.
Also, the database of RFID system does not satisfy
conﬁdentiality and untraceability to protect the secu-
rity of IC tag from the readers.

red When we apply the universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique to the e-voting system and RFID system,
the tallier of the e-voting system does not satisfy un-
traceability. This problem is caused by the original
the universal re-encryption public technique. The uni-
versal re-encryption public technique guarantees only
external anonymity. But, if the tallier is a trust party
and should not collude with other participant, the pri-
vacy of a voter can be guaranteed. Moreover, our
e-voting system based on the unviersal re-encryption
public technique has the excellent computational cost
than other e-voting systems based on a mix-net scheme
like table 1.

2 The universal re-encryption for Mix-

net and Security Analysis

2.1 The universal re-encryption for Mix-net

The outline of Golle et al. s the universal re-encryption

for mix-net is as follows.
- Every input to the mix-net is encrypted under the
public key of the recipient for whom it is intended.
- Thus, unlike standard re-encryption mix-net, univer-
sal mix-net accepts ciphertexts encrypted under the in-
dividual public keys of receivers, rather than encrypted
the unique public key of the mix network.
- The output of universal mix-net is a set of cipher-
texts.
- Recipients can retrieve from the set of output cipher-
texts those addressed to them, and decrypt them.
Key generation (UKG) Output (PK,SK)= (y =
gx, x) for x ∈U Zq.
Encryption (UE) Input comprises a message m, a
public key y, and a random encryption factor r =
(k0, k1) ∈ Z 2
q . The output is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] = [(myk0 , gk0); (yk1 , gk1)].
We write C = U EP K(m, r) or C = U EP K(m) for
brevity.
Decryption (UD) Input is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] under public key y. Verify α0, β0, α1, β1 ∈ g
; if not, the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output. Compute m0 = α0/βx
0 and m1 = α1/βx
1 .
If m1 = 1, then the output is m = m0. Otherwise,
the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output.
Note that this ensures a binding between ciphertexts
and keys: a given ciphertext can be decrypted only un-
der one given key.
Re-encryption (URe) Input is a ciphertext C =
[(α0, β0); (α1, β1)] with a random re-encryption fac-
tor r(cid:48) = (k(cid:48)

two operations : (1) The server re-encrypts all the uni-

and (2) The server writes the resulting new ciphertexts
back to the bulletin board in random order, overwrit-

be able to prove that it operated correctly.

2.2 Security Analysis

The advantages of the universal re-encryption are as

follows.
- Can be done without knowledge of public keys.
- Construct a mix-net of this kind in which servers hold
no public or private keying material.
- Half as eﬃcient as standard ElGamal encryption.
The main properties of universal mix-net are as follows.
- Universal mix-net holds no keying material.
- Universal mix-net guarantees forward anonymity.
- Universal mix-net does not support escrow capability.
In the universal re-encryption mix-net, if a malicious
mix-server St selects kt
1, a coercer can know the
inputs from the outputs of St as follows.

But, if only one mix-center among mix-centers is trust,

3.3 Eﬃciency

The important problem in the application systems
based on a mix-net scheme is the eﬃcient proof and
decryption methods. Sako and Killian [?] proposed

cut and choose zero-knowledge proof. This scheme
has not only problems of privacy, but also the high
load of tallying [?, ?]. Neﬀ [?] proposed the polyno-
mial scheme for more eﬃcient proof of correct mixing.
However, this scheme has an inﬂuence on the com-
putational complexity by the number of mix-center.
Jakobsson et al.[?] proposed randomized partial check-
ing scheme, and Golle et al.
[?] proposed optimistic
mixing sheme. Table 1shows the computational costs
of these systems. Although a mix-net scheme is eﬃ-

cient as an anonymous channel, due to the load of the
correctness proof of mixing and decryption, the worth
of a mix-net scheme has fallen. Maintaining the ef-
fect of the anonymity channel of a mix-net, these prob-
lems must be solved in order to use a mix-net scheme.
The universal re-encryption mix-net of Golle et al. [?]
can decrease the computation complexity by decryp-
tion. In order to de-crease the computation complex-
ity by a proof of mixing, we use designated-veriﬁer re-
encryption proof.
In this proof, each mix-center has
only 2nk for the proof of his mixing like Table 1.

4 RFID System Using the universal re-

encryption

4.1 Model of the system

We deﬁne a model in the RFID system using Uni-
versal Re-encryption based on ElGamal. The model
consists of a RFID tag, a database, a reader, and an
attacker. If the property of universal re-encryption is
used in the case of re-encryption, then third party,

Abstract— Golle et al. proposed a universal re-encryption scheme for mix-net in RSA2004. In
case of re-encryption, this universal re-encryption does not need a public key, but just uses a random
encryption factor. Therefore, the decryption is very simple than that of other re-encryption schemes.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to e-voting system and RFID system which have
recently received a lot of attention for privacy and security with the advantage of the universal re-
encryption. Furthermore, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting system and RFID system. In
case of e-voting based on the universal re-encryption, it can take the eﬀective computational complexity
because the decryption for the counting of voting contents is possible at once. But, it needs the
requirement that the tallier is a trusted party. In case of RFID system, a consumer
s privacy can be
infringed by a strong tracing ability. Although ID of a RFID tag can be encrypted, it is possible to
pursue an object by tracing speciﬁc information. We discuss security and privacy of e-voting system
and RFID system using the universal re-encryption.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Many e-voting systems have been proposed for se-
cure on-line voting [?, ?, ?]. A few systems of these are
used in real election. But, e-voting system is controver-
sial recent topic. The recent topics of e-voting system
are receipt-freeness and universal veriﬁability. Receipt-
freeness means that a voter can not construct a receipt
to provide the content of his vote. Universal veriﬁa-
bility means that anyone can verify a correctness of
election. Sako and Killian[?] proposed e-voting system
based on a mix-net to solve receipt-freeness and univer-
sal veriﬁability. A mix-net was proposed by Chaum[?].
A mix-net is used to apply many applications as anony-
mous channel. A mix-net takes a list of ciphertexts
of users and outputs a permuted list of the plaintexts
without revealing the relationship between and . Gen-
erally, a mix-net provides anonymity, privacy, and ro-
bustness as follows.
- Privacy : The messages are sent anonymously.
- Anonymity : Anyone should not know the relation
between a sender and his message.
- Robustness: Although one mix-centers is stopped,
it should not aﬀect an entire system.
- Individual Veriﬁability : A sender has to check
whether or not his message has reached to its destina-
tion.

Michels and Horster [?] pointed out that Sako-Killian s
scheme has problems of privacy and robustness. These
problems give rise to a serious loss on voting system.
Golle et al.[?] proposed a universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique that permits the universal re-encryption
of ciphertexts. Like standard re-encryption, the uni-
versal re-encryption transforms a ciphertext into a new
ciphertext with same corresponding plaintext. More-
over, they proposed a mix-net based on their universal
re-encryption.

A Radio-Frequency-Identiﬁcation (RFID) tag is a
small and inexpensive device that consists of an IC chip
and an antenna which communicate by radio frequency.
A radio communication device called as a reader emits
a query to RFID tags and reads their ID. Some read-
ers also transmit power to RFID tags when they emit
a query.
In this case, RFID tags do not have power
supply. Therefore RFID tags are expected to be used
as a substitute for a bar code in the future [?, ?, ?, ?].
In order to use as a bar code, the cost of RFID tags is
0.05$/unit, and tags are small as 0.4mm 0.4mm and
thin enough to be embedded in the papers [?, ?]. For
this reason, the processing capacity of a RFID tag is
limited. The RFID system using this tag and a reader
is used for the automobile object identiﬁcation. Since
the goods attached the RFID tags in a cardboard box
can be checked even if the box is not opened, so it is
used for management of goods[?, ?]. A RFID tag is
attached to goods, and it is expected that its function
like a bar code is achieved and it is useful to theft de-
tection. Moreover, after goods are purchased, a RFID
system gives a useful function for a consumer. For ex-
ample, a refrigerator with the reader will be able to
recognize expired food-stuﬀs, and a closet will be able

to oﬀer a few of the enticing possibilities of its con-
tents [?]. Moreover the European Central Bank (ECB)
has proposed to embedded RFID tags in Euro ban-
knotes [?]. By using identiﬁcation combined ID on
RFID tags and serial number printed on banknotes, it
is expected to prevent
forgery or money laundering.
The communication between a reader and a RFID tag
is performed by radio. So it is simply tapped by an at-
tacker. The reader can simply derive information from
the RFID tag and it can be used to infringement of the
privacy [?, ?]. Since the RFID tag has unique ID, if the
attacker obtains the ID, he can get the information on
the object that the tag was attached. For example, the
size and the price of clothes, the contents of a wallet,
the inventory information on the goods of a store etc.
can be leaked. As a result, it infringes on the owner
s privacy. Moreover, the location of the owner can be
traced by tracing the information on the speciﬁc RFID
tag even if the attacker cannot understand the contents
of ID. This privacy about owner
s location is called
as location privacy [?]. For this reason, there are some
problems such as a retail store pursues a consumer and
the circulation information on goods is revealed.

1.2 Related works

As above mentioned, many schemes for secure e-
voting system have been proposed. Fujioka, Okamoto
and Ohta [?] proposed a practical secret voting scheme
for large scale elections based on blind signature and
bit-commitment. Ohkubo et al.[?] upgraded the e-
voting scheme of [?] through threshold encryption in-
stead of bit-commitment scheme. Benaloh and Tuin-
stra [?] proposed the ﬁrst receipt-free scheme for e-
voting system. They put physically guarantees secret
communication, as a voting booth, between the au-
thorities and each voter. Sako and Kilian [?] proposed
receipt-free voting protocol based on a mix-net channel.
They assumed the existence of one-way secret commu-
nication, as an untappable private channel, between
each authority and each voter. The important disad-
vantage of this scheme is that heavy cost load can be
happened in tallying because of mix-net scheme [?].
Hirt and Sako[?] introduced the eﬃcient receipt-free
voting based on homomorphic encryption. To achieve
a receipt-freeness, they used schemes of [?] and [?].
Jakobsson[?] proposed a practical mix to achieve pri-
vacy, robustness, and veriﬁability in 1998. He used
Blinding I, Blinding II, Unblinding I and Unblinding II.
Desmedt and Kurosawa [?] showed an attack such that
at least one malicious mix-centers can prevent comput-
ing the correct output. And, Jakobsson [?] proposed a
ﬂash mix-net to achieve privacy, robustness and veriﬁ-
ability. His mix-net consists of blinding protocol and
unblinding protocol using two dummy elements which
are inserted into the input list at the beginning of the
protocol in ﬂash mix. The blinding protocol consists
of the ﬁrst re-encryption and the second re-encryption.
Mitomo and Kurosawa [?] showed the attack method
of Jokobsson s ﬂash mix under the condition which at
most among mix-centers and at most among senders is
malicious.

Also, since the communication between a RFID tag
and a reader is monitored simply, it applies encryp-
tion to the communication, or uses authentication an
owner or a speciﬁc reader [?]. Since the reader
s ca-
pability is not restricted, the reader can encrypt the
contents of a RFID tag. However, since the cost of a
RFID tag is cheap, the RFID tag has only the limited
processing capability. Moreover it is possible that the
communication between a RFID tag and a reader is
intercepted. Therefore, it is diﬃcult for the RFID tag
to authenticate the speciﬁc reader. In addition to en-
crypt the information on the RFID tag, there is an ap-
proach of re-encrypting the encrypted information on
the RFID tag periodically [?]. Re-encryption means
encrypting a ciphertext again. It is performed by us-
ing public key cryptography. Even if a ciphertext is
re-encrypted repeatedly, we can obtain the plaintext
by decrypting only once with using a private key. By
using symmetric key cryptography, we must decrypt
the re-encrypted ciphertext many times or the reader
has to synchronize with the RFID tag. Moreover, if re-
encryption has the property of semantic security, it is
diﬃcult for an attacker to get the original cipher-text
from the re-encrypted ciphertext [?]. Since the infor-
mation on a RFID tag is changed by re-encryption, it
can prevent from tracing the information on the spe-
ciﬁc RFID tag. Moreover, if the reader processes re-
encryption, a RFID tag does not need carry out com-
plicated processing. However, if a reader processes re-
encryption with a public key, the owner has to deliver
information about the public key for the reader in case
of re-encryption. In that case, the attacker will be pos-
sible to trace the RFID tag relevant to the public key
[?]. Although you may consider making the RFID tag
itself process re-encryption, it is diﬃcult for the RFID
tag to process re-encryption because its processing ca-
pability is restricted.

1.3 Our Contribution

We apply the universal re-encryption public tech-
nique for a mix-net which is proposed by Golle et al.
to an e-voting system and an RFID system. For the
re-encryption, this universal re-encryption uses just a
random encryption factor, not a public key. Therefore,
the application system based on the can get the eﬀec-
tive communication complexity in the decryption stage.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to
e-voting system and RFID system which have recently
received a lot of attention for privacy and security with
the advantage of the universal re-encryption. Further-
more, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting
system and RFID system based on the universal re-
encryption. Our e-voting system and RFID system
consist of each three kinds of participants as follows.
E-voting system : A voter, Mix-centers, Tallier
RFID system : IC tag, Readers, Database
A voter and IC tags play a role as a sender, and mix-
centers and readers are mixing-center to shuﬄe the re-
ceived data. Tallier and database are authorities to
decrypt. Then, mix-centers and readers satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and untraceability for secure e-voting system

and RFID system. The tallier of an e-voting system
satisﬁes untraceability, not conﬁdentiality. If the tal-
lier satisﬁes conﬁdentiality, he can trace a voter
s ID.
Therefore, it can be happened the privacy of a voter.
Also, the database of RFID system does not satisfy
conﬁdentiality and untraceability to protect the secu-
rity of IC tag from the readers.

red When we apply the universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique to the e-voting system and RFID system,
the tallier of the e-voting system does not satisfy un-
traceability. This problem is caused by the original
the universal re-encryption public technique. The uni-
versal re-encryption public technique guarantees only
external anonymity. But, if the tallier is a trust party
and should not collude with other participant, the pri-
vacy of a voter can be guaranteed. Moreover, our
e-voting system based on the unviersal re-encryption
public technique has the excellent computational cost
than other e-voting systems based on a mix-net scheme
like table 1.

2 The universal re-encryption for Mix-

net and Security Analysis

2.1 The universal re-encryption for Mix-net

The outline of Golle et al. s the universal re-encryption

for mix-net is as follows.
- Every input to the mix-net is encrypted under the
public key of the recipient for whom it is intended.
- Thus, unlike standard re-encryption mix-net, univer-
sal mix-net accepts ciphertexts encrypted under the in-
dividual public keys of receivers, rather than encrypted
the unique public key of the mix network.
- The output of universal mix-net is a set of cipher-
texts.
- Recipients can retrieve from the set of output cipher-
texts those addressed to them, and decrypt them.
Key generation (UKG) Output (PK,SK)= (y =
gx, x) for x ∈U Zq.
Encryption (UE) Input comprises a message m, a
public key y, and a random encryption factor r =
(k0, k1) ∈ Z 2
q . The output is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] = [(myk0 , gk0); (yk1 , gk1)].
We write C = U EP K(m, r) or C = U EP K(m) for
brevity.
Decryption (UD) Input is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] under public key y. Verify α0, β0, α1, β1 ∈ g
; if not, the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output. Compute m0 = α0/βx
0 and m1 = α1/βx
1 .
If m1 = 1, then the output is m = m0. Otherwise,
the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output.
Note that this ensures a binding between ciphertexts
and keys: a given ciphertext can be decrypted only un-
der one given key.
Re-encryption (URe) Input is a ciphertext C =
[(α0, β0); (α1, β1)] with a random re-encryption fac-
tor r(cid:48) = (k(cid:48)

mix the concept of the bulletin board. This involves
two operations : (1) The server re-encrypts all the uni-
versal ciphertexts on the bulletin board using URe,
and (2) The server writes the resulting new ciphertexts
back to the bulletin board in random order, overwrit-
ing the old ones. It is also desirable that a mix server
be able to prove that it operated correctly.

2.2 Security Analysis

The advantages of the universal re-encryption are as

follows.
- Can be done without knowledge of public keys.
- Construct a mix-net of this kind in which servers hold
no public or private keying material.
- Half as eﬃcient as standard ElGamal encryption.
The main properties of universal mix-net are as follows.
- Universal mix-net holds no keying material.
- Universal mix-net guarantees forward anonymity.
- Universal mix-net does not support escrow capability.
In the universal re-encryption mix-net, if a malicious
mix-server St selects kt
1, a coercer can know the
inputs from the outputs of St as follows.
Input :

0 = kt

C t−1 = [(αt−1

Output :

C t = [(αt

Then, a coercer can get parts of C (t − 1) from C t as
follows.

But, if only one mix-center among mix-centers is trust,
privacy, anonymous and robustness are guaranteed. Only,
the trust mix-center should select each diﬀerent ran-
dom re-encryption factor.

3.3 Eﬃciency

The important problem in the application systems
based on a mix-net scheme is the eﬃcient proof and
decryption methods. Sako and Killian [?] proposed

cut and choose zero-knowledge proof. This scheme
has not only problems of privacy, but also the high
load of tallying [?, ?]. Neﬀ [?] proposed the polyno-
mial scheme for more eﬃcient proof of correct mixing.
However, this scheme has an inﬂuence on the com-
putational complexity by the number of mix-center.
Jakobsson et al.[?] proposed randomized partial check-
ing scheme, and Golle et al.
[?] proposed optimistic
mixing sheme. Table 1shows the computational costs
of these systems. Although a mix-net scheme is eﬃ-

cient as an anonymous channel, due to the load of the
correctness proof of mixing and decryption, the worth
of a mix-net scheme has fallen. Maintaining the ef-
fect of the anonymity channel of a mix-net, these prob-
lems must be solved in order to use a mix-net scheme.
The universal re-encryption mix-net of Golle et al. [?]
can decrease the computation complexity by decryp-
tion. In order to de-crease the computation complex-
ity by a proof of mixing, we use designated-veriﬁer re-
encryption proof.
In this proof, each mix-center has
only 2nk for the proof of his mixing like Table 1.

4 RFID System Using the universal re-

encryption

4.1 Model of the system

We deﬁne a model in the RFID system using Uni-
versal Re-encryption based on ElGamal. The model
consists of a RFID tag, a database, a reader, and an
attacker. If the property of universal re-encryption is
used in the case of re-encryption, then third party,
such as a bank and a public institution, can process
re-encryption procedure as a service. The components
of the proposal system are shown below.

• RFID tag: A RFID tag emits an ID information
(ciphertext C) in response to query from a reader.
Its ID information (ciphertext C) is encrypted by
universal re-encryption.

• Database: A database has private key x for ID
information (ciphertext C) on a RFID tag, and
the information on the item relevant to the RFID
tag. Private key x is saved securely by an existing
access control scheme. In addition, it is necessary

to use the existing authentication scheme for ac-
cessing this information. Moreover, this also per-
forms calculation of re-encryption of ID informa-
tion.

• Reader: This emits a query to a RFID tag and
receives ID information (ciphertext C). And it
re-encrypt the cipertext C by using universal re-
encryption. Then, it updates the ID information
of the RFID tag. Using universal re-encryption, if
a reader for re-encryption saved ID information,
it becomes diﬃcult for tracing a RFID tag by
semantic security when the next re-encryption is
performed by another reader.

• Attacker: This tries to derive information from
a RFID tag and to infringe on an owner’s location
privacy. Moreover, he alters the information on
a RFID tag.

4.2 Protocol of the system

The protocol of Universal Re-encryption based on

ElGamal is shown below.

• Key generation: Output secret key x and pub-

lic key (y = gx).

• Encryption: Ciphertext C = [(α0, β0); (α1, β1)]
is generated from the following formulas using
message m, public key y, and random number
r = (k0, k1).

5 Security analysis

Here, we analyze security and privacy on our e-voting
and RFID system.
In section 3 and 4, we proposed
simple e-voting system and RFID system based on the
universal re-encryption public technique of Golle et al.
When we compare e-voting system to RFID system, we
can ﬁnd the common points as follows.
- Votes and tag contents should arrive safely and surely
at the destination.
- No one should know the relation between a voter and
a vote, and between an IC tag and tag contents.
- The mix-centers should shuﬄe honestly the contents.
Also, we can ﬁnd the similar roles by participants in
two application systems as table 2.
In table 2, there

and RFID system.

tag content. Then, it should keep the following con-
ditions for secure e-voting and RFID system in view-

is output.
A given key can be decrypted only under one given

It will get a message m0 as ID of the RFID tag.
Even if ciphertext C is re-encrypted many times,
it can return to plaintext by decryption once.

reader selects random number r(cid:48) = (k(cid:48)

it generates new ciphertext C(cid:48) by calculating the

Abstract— Golle et al. proposed a universal re-encryption scheme for mix-net in RSA2004. In
case of re-encryption, this universal re-encryption does not need a public key, but just uses a random
encryption factor. Therefore, the decryption is very simple than that of other re-encryption schemes.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to e-voting system and RFID system which have
recently received a lot of attention for privacy and security with the advantage of the universal re-
encryption. Furthermore, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting system and RFID system. In
case of e-voting based on the universal re-encryption, it can take the eﬀective computational complexity
because the decryption for the counting of voting contents is possible at once. But, it needs the
requirement that the tallier is a trusted party. In case of RFID system, a consumer
s privacy can be
infringed by a strong tracing ability. Although ID of a RFID tag can be encrypted, it is possible to
pursue an object by tracing speciﬁc information. We discuss security and privacy of e-voting system
and RFID system using the universal re-encryption.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Many e-voting systems have been proposed for se-
cure on-line voting [?, ?, ?]. A few systems of these are
used in real election. But, e-voting system is controver-
sial recent topic. The recent topics of e-voting system
are receipt-freeness and universal veriﬁability. Receipt-
freeness means that a voter can not construct a receipt
to provide the content of his vote. Universal veriﬁa-
bility means that anyone can verify a correctness of
election. Sako and Killian[?] proposed e-voting system
based on a mix-net to solve receipt-freeness and univer-
sal veriﬁability. A mix-net was proposed by Chaum[?].
A mix-net is used to apply many applications as anony-
mous channel. A mix-net takes a list of ciphertexts
of users and outputs a permuted list of the plaintexts
without revealing the relationship between and . Gen-
erally, a mix-net provides anonymity, privacy, and ro-
bustness as follows.
- Privacy : The messages are sent anonymously.
- Anonymity : Anyone should not know the relation
between a sender and his message.
- Robustness: Although one mix-centers is stopped,
it should not aﬀect an entire system.
- Individual Veriﬁability : A sender has to check
whether or not his message has reached to its destina-
tion.

Michels and Horster [?] pointed out that Sako-Killian s
scheme has problems of privacy and robustness. These
problems give rise to a serious loss on voting system.
Golle et al.[?] proposed a universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique that permits the universal re-encryption
of ciphertexts. Like standard re-encryption, the uni-
versal re-encryption transforms a ciphertext into a new
ciphertext with same corresponding plaintext. More-
over, they proposed a mix-net based on their universal
re-encryption.

A Radio-Frequency-Identiﬁcation (RFID) tag is a
small and inexpensive device that consists of an IC chip
and an antenna which communicate by radio frequency.
A radio communication device called as a reader emits
a query to RFID tags and reads their ID. Some read-
ers also transmit power to RFID tags when they emit
a query.
In this case, RFID tags do not have power
supply. Therefore RFID tags are expected to be used
as a substitute for a bar code in the future [?, ?, ?, ?].
In order to use as a bar code, the cost of RFID tags is
0.05$/unit, and tags are small as 0.4mm 0.4mm and
thin enough to be embedded in the papers [?, ?]. For
this reason, the processing capacity of a RFID tag is
limited. The RFID system using this tag and a reader
is used for the automobile object identiﬁcation. Since
the goods attached the RFID tags in a cardboard box
can be checked even if the box is not opened, so it is
used for management of goods[?, ?]. A RFID tag is
attached to goods, and it is expected that its function
like a bar code is achieved and it is useful to theft de-
tection. Moreover, after goods are purchased, a RFID
system gives a useful function for a consumer. For ex-
ample, a refrigerator with the reader will be able to
recognize expired food-stuﬀs, and a closet will be able

to oﬀer a few of the enticing possibilities of its con-
tents [?]. Moreover the European Central Bank (ECB)
has proposed to embedded RFID tags in Euro ban-
knotes [?]. By using identiﬁcation combined ID on
RFID tags and serial number printed on banknotes, it
is expected to prevent
forgery or money laundering.
The communication between a reader and a RFID tag
is performed by radio. So it is simply tapped by an at-
tacker. The reader can simply derive information from
the RFID tag and it can be used to infringement of the
privacy [?, ?]. Since the RFID tag has unique ID, if the
attacker obtains the ID, he can get the information on
the object that the tag was attached. For example, the
size and the price of clothes, the contents of a wallet,
the inventory information on the goods of a store etc.
can be leaked. As a result, it infringes on the owner
s privacy. Moreover, the location of the owner can be
traced by tracing the information on the speciﬁc RFID
tag even if the attacker cannot understand the contents
of ID. This privacy about owner
s location is called
as location privacy [?]. For this reason, there are some
problems such as a retail store pursues a consumer and
the circulation information on goods is revealed.

1.2 Related works

As above mentioned, many schemes for secure e-
voting system have been proposed. Fujioka, Okamoto
and Ohta [?] proposed a practical secret voting scheme
for large scale elections based on blind signature and
bit-commitment. Ohkubo et al.[?] upgraded the e-
voting scheme of [?] through threshold encryption in-
stead of bit-commitment scheme. Benaloh and Tuin-
stra [?] proposed the ﬁrst receipt-free scheme for e-
voting system. They put physically guarantees secret
communication, as a voting booth, between the au-
thorities and each voter. Sako and Kilian [?] proposed
receipt-free voting protocol based on a mix-net channel.
They assumed the existence of one-way secret commu-
nication, as an untappable private channel, between
each authority and each voter. The important disad-
vantage of this scheme is that heavy cost load can be
happened in tallying because of mix-net scheme [?].
Hirt and Sako[?] introduced the eﬃcient receipt-free
voting based on homomorphic encryption. To achieve
a receipt-freeness, they used schemes of [?] and [?].
Jakobsson[?] proposed a practical mix to achieve pri-
vacy, robustness, and veriﬁability in 1998. He used
Blinding I, Blinding II, Unblinding I and Unblinding II.
Desmedt and Kurosawa [?] showed an attack such that
at least one malicious mix-centers can prevent comput-
ing the correct output. And, Jakobsson [?] proposed a
ﬂash mix-net to achieve privacy, robustness and veriﬁ-
ability. His mix-net consists of blinding protocol and
unblinding protocol using two dummy elements which
are inserted into the input list at the beginning of the
protocol in ﬂash mix. The blinding protocol consists
of the ﬁrst re-encryption and the second re-encryption.
Mitomo and Kurosawa [?] showed the attack method
of Jokobsson s ﬂash mix under the condition which at
most among mix-centers and at most among senders is
malicious.

Also, since the communication between a RFID tag
and a reader is monitored simply, it applies encryp-
tion to the communication, or uses authentication an
owner or a speciﬁc reader [?]. Since the reader
s ca-
pability is not restricted, the reader can encrypt the
contents of a RFID tag. However, since the cost of a
RFID tag is cheap, the RFID tag has only the limited
processing capability. Moreover it is possible that the
communication between a RFID tag and a reader is
intercepted. Therefore, it is diﬃcult for the RFID tag
to authenticate the speciﬁc reader. In addition to en-
crypt the information on the RFID tag, there is an ap-
proach of re-encrypting the encrypted information on
the RFID tag periodically [?]. Re-encryption means
encrypting a ciphertext again. It is performed by us-
ing public key cryptography. Even if a ciphertext is
re-encrypted repeatedly, we can obtain the plaintext
by decrypting only once with using a private key. By
using symmetric key cryptography, we must decrypt
the re-encrypted ciphertext many times or the reader
has to synchronize with the RFID tag. Moreover, if re-
encryption has the property of semantic security, it is
diﬃcult for an attacker to get the original cipher-text
from the re-encrypted ciphertext [?]. Since the infor-
mation on a RFID tag is changed by re-encryption, it
can prevent from tracing the information on the spe-
ciﬁc RFID tag. Moreover, if the reader processes re-
encryption, a RFID tag does not need carry out com-
plicated processing. However, if a reader processes re-
encryption with a public key, the owner has to deliver
information about the public key for the reader in case
of re-encryption. In that case, the attacker will be pos-
sible to trace the RFID tag relevant to the public key
[?]. Although you may consider making the RFID tag
itself process re-encryption, it is diﬃcult for the RFID
tag to process re-encryption because its processing ca-
pability is restricted.

1.3 Our Contribution

We apply the universal re-encryption public tech-
nique for a mix-net which is proposed by Golle et al.
to an e-voting system and an RFID system. For the
re-encryption, this universal re-encryption uses just a
random encryption factor, not a public key. Therefore,
the application system based on the can get the eﬀec-
tive communication complexity in the decryption stage.
In this paper, we apply this universal re-encryption to
e-voting system and RFID system which have recently
received a lot of attention for privacy and security with
the advantage of the universal re-encryption. Further-
more, we analyze security and privacy of our e-voting
system and RFID system based on the universal re-
encryption. Our e-voting system and RFID system
consist of each three kinds of participants as follows.
E-voting system : A voter, Mix-centers, Tallier
RFID system : IC tag, Readers, Database
A voter and IC tags play a role as a sender, and mix-
centers and readers are mixing-center to shuﬄe the re-
ceived data. Tallier and database are authorities to
decrypt. Then, mix-centers and readers satisfy conﬁ-
dentiality and untraceability for secure e-voting system

and RFID system. The tallier of an e-voting system
satisﬁes untraceability, not conﬁdentiality. If the tal-
lier satisﬁes conﬁdentiality, he can trace a voter
s ID.
Therefore, it can be happened the privacy of a voter.
Also, the database of RFID system does not satisfy
conﬁdentiality and untraceability to protect the secu-
rity of IC tag from the readers.

red When we apply the universal re-encryption pub-
lic technique to the e-voting system and RFID system,
the tallier of the e-voting system does not satisfy un-
traceability. This problem is caused by the original
the universal re-encryption public technique. The uni-
versal re-encryption public technique guarantees only
external anonymity. But, if the tallier is a trust party
and should not collude with other participant, the pri-
vacy of a voter can be guaranteed. Moreover, our
e-voting system based on the unviersal re-encryption
public technique has the excellent computational cost
than other e-voting systems based on a mix-net scheme
like table 1.

2 The universal re-encryption for Mix-

net and Security Analysis

2.1 The universal re-encryption for Mix-net

The outline of Golle et al. s the universal re-encryption

for mix-net is as follows.
- Every input to the mix-net is encrypted under the
public key of the recipient for whom it is intended.
- Thus, unlike standard re-encryption mix-net, univer-
sal mix-net accepts ciphertexts encrypted under the in-
dividual public keys of receivers, rather than encrypted
the unique public key of the mix network.
- The output of universal mix-net is a set of cipher-
texts.
- Recipients can retrieve from the set of output cipher-
texts those addressed to them, and decrypt them.
Key generation (UKG) Output (PK,SK)= (y =
gx, x) for x ∈U Zq.
Encryption (UE) Input comprises a message m, a
public key y, and a random encryption factor r =
(k0, k1) ∈ Z 2
q . The output is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] = [(myk0 , gk0); (yk1 , gk1)].
We write C = U EP K(m, r) or C = U EP K(m) for
brevity.
Decryption (UD) Input is a ciphertext C = [(α0, β0);
(α1, β1)] under public key y. Verify α0, β0, α1, β1 ∈ g
; if not, the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output. Compute m0 = α0/βx
0 and m1 = α1/βx
1 .
If m1 = 1, then the output is m = m0. Otherwise,
the decryption fails, and a special symbol
is output.
Note that this ensures a binding between ciphertexts
and keys: a given ciphertext can be decrypted only un-
der one given key.
Re-encryption (URe) Input is a ciphertext C =
[(α0, β0); (α1, β1)] with a random re-encryption fac-
tor r(cid:48) = (k(cid:48)

mix the concept of the bulletin board. This involves
two operations : (1) The server re-encrypts all the uni-
versal ciphertexts on the bulletin board using URe,
and (2) The server writes the resulting new ciphertexts
back to the bulletin board in random order, overwrit-
ing the old ones. It is also desirable that a mix server
be able to prove that it operated correctly.

2.2 Security Analysis

The advantages of the universal re-encryption are as

follows.
- Can be done without knowledge of public keys.
- Construct a mix-net of this kind in which servers hold
no public or private keying material.
- Half as eﬃcient as standard ElGamal encryption.
The main properties of universal mix-net are as follows.
- Universal mix-net holds no keying material.
- Universal mix-net guarantees forward anonymity.
- Universal mix-net does not support escrow capability.
In the universal re-encryption mix-net, if a malicious
mix-server St selects kt
1, a coercer can know the
inputs from the outputs of St as follows.
Input :

0 = kt

C t−1 = [(αt−1

Output :

C t = [(αt

Then, a coercer can get parts of C (t − 1) from C t as
follows.

C t−1 = [(α(t−1)

But, if only one mix-center among mix-centers is trust,
privacy, anonymous and robustness are guaranteed. Only,
the trust mix-center should select each diﬀerent ran-
dom re-encryption factor.

3.3 Eﬃciency

The important problem in the application systems
based on a mix-net scheme is the eﬃcient proof and
decryption methods. Sako and Killian [?] proposed

cut and choose zero-knowledge proof. This scheme
has not only problems of privacy, but also the high
load of tallying [?, ?]. Neﬀ [?] proposed the polyno-
mial scheme for more eﬃcient proof of correct mixing.
However, this scheme has an inﬂuence on the com-
putational complexity by the number of mix-center.
Jakobsson et al.[?] proposed randomized partial check-
ing scheme, and Golle et al.
[?] proposed optimistic
mixing sheme. Table 1shows the computational costs
of these systems. Although a mix-net scheme is eﬃ-

cient as an anonymous channel, due to the load of the
correctness proof of mixing and decryption, the worth
of a mix-net scheme has fallen. Maintaining the ef-
fect of the anonymity channel of a mix-net, these prob-
lems must be solved in order to use a mix-net scheme.
The universal re-encryption mix-net of Golle et al. [?]
can decrease the computation complexity by decryp-
tion. In order to de-crease the computation complex-
ity by a proof of mixing, we use designated-veriﬁer re-
encryption proof.
In this proof, each mix-center has
only 2nk for the proof of his mixing like Table 1.

4 RFID System Using the universal re-

encryption

4.1 Model of the system

We deﬁne a model in the RFID system using Uni-
versal Re-encryption based on ElGamal. The model
consists of a RFID tag, a database, a reader, and an
attacker. If the property of universal re-encryption is
used in the case of re-encryption, then third party,
such as a bank and a public institution, can process
re-encryption procedure as a service. The components
of the proposal system are shown below.

• RFID tag: A RFID tag emits an ID information
(ciphertext C) in response to query from a reader.
Its ID information (ciphertext C) is encrypted by
universal re-encryption.

• Database: A database has private key x for ID
information (ciphertext C) on a RFID tag, and
the information on the item relevant to the RFID
tag. Private key x is saved securely by an existing
access control scheme. In addition, it is necessary

to use the existing authentication scheme for ac-
cessing this information. Moreover, this also per-
forms calculation of re-encryption of ID informa-
tion.

• Reader: This emits a query to a RFID tag and
receives ID information (ciphertext C). And it
re-encrypt the cipertext C by using universal re-
encryption. Then, it updates the ID information
of the RFID tag. Using universal re-encryption, if
a reader for re-encryption saved ID information,
it becomes diﬃcult for tracing a RFID tag by
semantic security when the next re-encryption is
performed by another reader.

• Attacker: This tries to derive information from
a RFID tag and to infringe on an owner’s location
privacy. Moreover, he alters the information on
a RFID tag.

4.2 Protocol of the system

The protocol of Universal Re-encryption based on

ElGamal is shown below.

• Key generation: Output secret key x and pub-

lic key (y = gx).

• Encryption: Ciphertext C = [(α0, β0); (α1, β1)]
is generated from the following formulas using
message m, public key y, and random number
r = (k0, k1).

5 Security analysis

Here, we analyze security and privacy on our e-voting
and RFID system.
In section 3 and 4, we proposed
simple e-voting system and RFID system based on the
universal re-encryption public technique of Golle et al.
When we compare e-voting system to RFID system, we
can ﬁnd the common points as follows.
- Votes and tag contents should arrive safely and surely
at the destination.
- No one should know the relation between a voter and
a vote, and between an IC tag and tag contents.
- The mix-centers should shuﬄe honestly the contents.
Also, we can ﬁnd the similar roles by participants in
two application systems as table 2.
In table 2, there

and RFID system.

are voters and IC tag such as a sender. The receivers
are the tallier of e-voting and the database of RFID sys-
tem. Also, mix-centers of e-voting system and readers
of RFID system shuﬄe the data which are a vote and
tag content. Then, it should keep the following con-
ditions for secure e-voting and RFID system in view-

calculates decryption algorithm described as fol-
lows.

Compute m0 = α0/βx
phertext C = [(α0, β0); (α1, β1)] under public key
y from a RFID tag and secret key x. If m1 = 1,
then output message m = m0. Otherwise the de-
cryption fails, and a special symbol
is output.
A given key can be decrypted only under one given
key.
It will get a message m0 as ID of the RFID tag.
Even if ciphertext C is re-encrypted many times,
it can return to plaintext by decryption once.

• Re-encryption: The reader derives ciphertext

C =
[(α0, β0); (α1, β1)] from a RFID tag. And the
reader selects random number r(cid:48) = (k(cid:48)
1). And
it generates new ciphertext C(cid:48) by calculating the
formula described as follow.

we analyze security and privacy on our e-voting and
RFID system using the universal re-encryption public
technique of Golle et al. For secure e-voting system
and RFID system, it should be satisﬁed the conditions
of table 3. For the intermediaries which are the mix-
centers of e-voting system and readers of RFID system,
it should be satisﬁed conﬁdentiality and untraceability.
Their roles are just to shuﬄe the received data.
In
case of the tallier, he should not have conﬁdentiality,
but untraceabiltiy for the counting of voting contents.
But, in case of database of RFID system, she should
not have conﬁdentiality and untraceability, and saves
safely the private key and computes the re-encrypted
ID information. So, she should not have conﬁdentiality
and untraceabilty.

Re-encrypted ciphertext C(cid:48) is written in a RFID
tag by the reader.

Internal anonymity VS. External anonymity
red The general mix-net schemes[?, ?, ?, ?] satisfy the

inner anonymity in order to prevent an eﬄuence of mes-
sages by a malicious mix-center. Although a mix-center
proves his mixing, he can know a piece of messages, be-
cause he has a public key and a private key to encrypt
and decrypt the message. The piece of messages can
become proof to guess the original messages. As Golle
et al pointed out that the universal re-encryption mix-
net guarantees only external anonymity, this mix-net
does not satisfy the inner anonymity. Since the mes-
sage is encrypted under the receiver
s public key, the
receiver can decrypt the encrypted message anytime
and anywhere as well as trace a message intended for
her throughout the mixing process. That is, it does not
provide anonymity for senders with respect to the re-
ceiver. When this mix-net is applied to application sys-
tems such as e-voting system, RFID system and so on,
if the receiver is a trust party, the privacy of a sender is
guaranteed. In our e-voting system, if the tallier should
not collude with other people or other participant, the
voter
s privacy can be guaranteed and our e-voting
system has the eﬀective computational cost like table
1. Moreover, in the universal re-encryption mix-net, a
malicious mix-center can not overﬂow a piece of votes,
because he plays just a role of mixing and has not a
public key and a private key.

6 Conclusion

Golle et al. proposed the universal re-encryption
public technique. In this paper, we apply this univer-
sal re-encryption public technique to an e-voting sys-
tem and a RFID system. Also, we analyze security and
privacy of our e-voting system and RFID system based
on the universal re-encryption public technique. The
universal re-encryption public technique can support
security and privacy for the secure RFID system. But,
in case of the e-voting, tallier should to be the trusted
third party. That is, the tallier should not collude with
other people including participants. Also, the tallier
should compute honestly the counting of voting con-
tents. Under this condition, the universal re-encryption
public technique can support eﬃciently for the secure
e-voting system.
