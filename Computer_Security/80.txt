It consists of a PC memory unit it stores the different driver image. FDS is used to 
detect the face of the driver and compare it with the predefined image. If the image 
doesn’t  match  then  the  information  is  send  to  the  owner  through  the  multimedia 
messaging service. Owner can trace the location through GPS. This system owner can 
identify the theft image as well as the location of the vehicle.  

The security system has a built in memory card module to store the image of the 
owner and family members. During driving the camera will capture the image of the 
person who is driving and compare it with the original image. If both the images are 
matched perfectly then there is no problem. The image processing is done such that the 
skin tone provides a contrast between the face and the background and thus rotation or 
movement  of  face  is  not  taken  into  consideration.  If  the  car  is  theft  then  the  image 
processing plays a vital role. The thief photo is captured and it is compared with the 
photos available in the memory card and suspects that there is no perfect match. At this 
instant  the  GSM  module  is  alerted  such  that  the  photo  of  the  thief  is  sent  as  a 
multimedia  message  to  the  owner  as  well  as  to  the  nearest  police  station.  The  GPS 
tracker  will  track  the  location  and  speed  of  the  vehicle  and  immediately  alert  the 
nearest toll gate to issue that vehicle is stolen and to cease the vehicle.

5.  Working: 
The  AC  voltage  typically  220V  RMS  is  connected  to  the  transformer  which  steps 
down  the  level  of  the  AC  voltage  down  to  level  of  desired  DC  output.  A  diode 
provides the full wave rectified voltage that is initially filtered by a simple capacitor 
filter. 

The embedded unit basically consists of the microcontroller having four ports. Port 
0  is  the  external  port  and  other  three  internal  ports.  The  heavy  devices  like  motor, 
alarm devices are connected to port0. This microcontroller used to transmit and receive 
the data’s.  

The serial communication has the MAX 232 IC and two serial ports, one serial port 
connects the GSM module and other connects the GPS module. Serial communication 
is basically the transmission or reception of data one bit at a time. Today’s computer 
generally addresses data in bytes. Every characteris actually represented as 1 byte. The 
serial  port  is  used  to  convert  the  byte  to  a  stream  of  ones  and  zeros  as  well  as  to 
convert a stream of ones and zeros to bytes. The serial port contains the electronic chip 
called the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) that actually does the 
conversion. 

6.  Face Detection algorithm: 
Object  detection  and  tracking  are  important  in  many  computer  vision  applications 
including  activity  recognition,  automotive  safety,  and  surveillance.  In  this  we 
developed a simple face tracking system by dividing the tracking problem into three 
separate problems: 

 
 

1.  Detect a face to track 
2.  Identify facial features to track 
3.  Track the face. 
 
Before  we  begin

it.  Use 
the CascadeObjectDetector to  detect  the  location  of  a  face  in  a  frame.  The  cascade 
object  detector  uses  the  Viola-Jones  detection  algorithm  and  a  trained  classification 
model for detection. By default, the detector is configured to detect faces, but it can be 
configured for other object types. 

face,  we  need 

first  detect 

We can use the cascade object detector to track a face across successive frames. 
However,  when  the  face  tilts  or  the  person  turns  their  head,  you  may  lose  tracking. 
This limitation is due to the type of trained classification model used for detection. To 
avoid  this  issue,  and  because  performing  face  detection  for  every  video  frame  is 
computationally intensive, this uses a simple facial feature for tracking. 

Once the face is located, the next step is to identify a feature that will help you 
track the face. For example, we can use the shape, texture, or color. Choose a feature 
that is unique to the object and remains invariant even when the object moves. 

In this paper, we use skin tone as the feature to track. The skin tone provides a 
good deal of contrast between the face and the background and does not change as the

processing plays a vital role. The thief photo is captured and it is compared with the 
photos available in the memory card and suspects that there is no perfect match. At this 
instant  the  GSM  module  is  alerted  such  that  the  photo  of  the  thief  is  sent  as  a 
multimedia  message  to  the  owner  as  well  as  to  the  nearest  police  station.  The  GPS 
tracker  will  track  the  location  and  speed  of  the  vehicle  and  immediately  alert  the 
nearest toll gate to issue that vehicle is stolen and to cease the vehicle.

5.  Working: 
The  AC  voltage  typically  220V  RMS  is  connected  to  the  transformer  which  steps 
down  the  level  of  the  AC  voltage  down  to  level  of  desired  DC  output.  A  diode 
provides the full wave rectified voltage that is initially filtered by a simple capacitor 
filter. 

The embedded unit basically consists of the microcontroller having four ports. Port 
0  is  the  external  port  and  other  three  internal  ports.  The  heavy  devices  like  motor, 
alarm devices are connected to port0. This microcontroller used to transmit and receive 
the data’s.  

The serial communication has the MAX 232 IC and two serial ports, one serial port 
connects the GSM module and other connects the GPS module. Serial communication 
is basically the transmission or reception of data one bit at a time. Today’s computer 
generally addresses data in bytes. Every characteris actually represented as 1 byte. The 
serial  port  is  used  to  convert  the  byte  to  a  stream  of  ones  and  zeros  as  well  as  to 
convert a stream of ones and zeros to bytes. The serial port contains the electronic chip 
called the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) that actually does the 
conversion. 

6.  Face Detection algorithm: 
Object  detection  and  tracking  are  important  in  many  computer  vision  applications 
including  activity  recognition,  automotive  safety,  and  surveillance.  In  this  we 
developed a simple face tracking system by dividing the tracking problem into three 
separate problems: 

 
 

1.  Detect a face to track 
2.  Identify facial features to track 
3.  Track the face. 
 
Before  we  begin 

tracking  a

it.  Use 
the CascadeObjectDetector to  detect  the  location  of  a  face  in  a  frame.  The  cascade 
object  detector  uses  the  Viola-Jones  detection  algorithm  and  a  trained  classification 
model for detection. By default, the detector is configured to detect faces, but it can be 
configured for other object types. 

face,  we  need 

first  detect 

We can use the cascade object detector to track a face across successive frames. 
However,  when  the  face  tilts  or  the  person  turns  their  head,  you  may  lose  tracking. 
This limitation is due to the type of trained classification model used for detection. To 
avoid  this  issue,  and  because  performing  face  detection  for  every  video  frame  is 
computationally intensive, this uses a simple facial feature for tracking. 

Once the face is located, the next step is to identify a feature that will help you 
track the face. For example, we can use the shape, texture, or color. Choose a feature 
that is unique to the object and remains invariant even when the object moves. 

In this paper, we use skin tone as the feature to track. The skin tone provides a 
good deal of contrast between the face and the background and does not change as the

face rotates or moves.With the skin tone selected as the feature to track, we can now 
use  theHistogramBasedTracker for  tracking.  The  histogram  based  tracker  uses  the 
CAM-Shift  algorithm,  which  provides  the  capability  to  track  an  object  using  a 
histogram of pixel values. In this the Hue channel pixels are extracted from the nose 
region of the detected face. These pixels are used to initialize the histogram for the 
tracker. Thispaper tracks the object over successive video frames using this histogram.

7.  Conclusion: 
From this we implement image recognition techniques that can provide the important 
functions  by  advanced  intelligent  automobile  security,  to  avoid  vehicle  theft  and 
protect the use of unauthenticated users. Secured and safety environment system for 
automobile  users  and  also  key  points  for  the  investigators  can  easily  find  out  the 
hijacked image. We can predict the theft by using this in our daily life. This paper will 
help to reduce the complexity and improve security, also much cheaper and smarter 
than traditional one’s.

In this proposed embedded automobile security system face detection 
system (FDS) is used to detect the face of the driver and compare it 
with  the  predefined  face.  In  the  night  when  the  vehicle  owner  is 
sleeping  and  someone  has  theft  the  vehicle,  then  FDS  obtains  the 
images by one tiny webcam which can be hidden in the steering. FDS 
compares the obtained image with the predefined if the image doesn’t 
match,  then  the  information  is  sent  to  owner  through  MMS.  So  now 
owner can obtain the image of the thief in mobile and trace the location 
of  the  vehicle  using  GPS.The  location  and  speed  of  the  vehicle  can 
also be displayed to owner through SMS. This face detection system 
uses the optimized algorithm and detects the face in the cars during the 
period  and  in  which  nobody  should  be  in  the  vehicle  and  makes  an 
alarm loudly. 
 
 

1.  Introduction 
The main aim of this paper is to offer an advanced security system in automotive, in 
which consists of a face detection system a GPS module, a GSM module and a control 
platform. The face detection system bases an optimized algorithm and detects faces in 
vehicles especially four wheelers during which nobody should be in the car, and make 
an alarm loudly.  

This  system  is  built  on  an  embedded  platform  in  which  one  system  on  a  chip 
(SOC)  named  “SEP4020”  (at  100MHz)  controls  all  the  processes.  The  automobile 
security  system  design  and  analysis  are  constantly  improving  in  the  embedded

platform.  New  techniques  such  as  the  biometric  recognition  and  image  processing 
techniques have been integrated into the automotive industry.  

Face detection system have been studied in the recent years and it is an important 
computer vision problem with applications to surveillance, multimedia processing and 
consumer  products.  Many  new  face  detection  techniques  have  been  developed  to 
achieve higher detection rate and faster. In this embedded smart automobile security 
system, FDS aims at detect somebody’s face in the vehicle during the time in which 
nobody should be in the vehicle.  

When FDS detects one face in alarm period, one alarm signal will be sent to the 
control central of the system. In silent alarm pattern, no direct alarm will be made, but 
several modules are working at inform owner and the police several important data, for 
example precise location of the vehicle. 

The GPS module obtains the precise locality by parsing received GPS signal. The 
GSM module can send the information out by SMS and the location of the vehicle. 
The  process  is  controlled  by  embedded  central  module,  including  images,  face 
detection and communicating by IIC bus interface.

Traditional  automobile  security  systems  rely  on  sensors  which  are  more  costly. 
When one vehicle is really lost, no more description could be valid to help people to 
find it back. We put forth the face detection technique to be applied in security because 
this kind of technique is effective and fast, and one alarm could be given to make a call 
to the police and the host soundlessly with the help of the other modules in the system 
prototype. 

3.  Description of the block diagram: 
The present existing security alarm system are still of no match to the well-equipped 
thieves.  It  is  just  a  matter  of  seconds  to  break  through  the  system.  This  paper 
introduces and describes a GSM based controlled automobile security system offering 
higher level of vehicle security features. The mobile controlled vehicle security offers 
many features of an effective two-way communication between the alarm system and 
the  owner.  This  system  is  able  to  notify  the  owner  immediately  when  intrusion  is 
detected. Additionally the owner can remotely control any of the features anytime at

anywhere via a phone call. Based on the GSM positioning concept, this system has the 
potential to provide location information to assist in stolen vehicle recovery therefore 
providing enhancement over the conventional alarm system. 

The  existing  system  has  the  demerits  like  only  alarm  system  exists,  can’t  be 
controlled via a network, after vehicle is theft its position can’t be detected, face of the 
person can’t be identified.

It consists of a PC memory unit it stores the different driver image. FDS is used to 
detect the face of the driver and compare it with the predefined image. If the image 
doesn’t  match  then  the  information  is  send  to  the  owner  through  the  multimedia 
messaging service. Owner can trace the location through GPS. This system owner can 
identify the theft image as well as the location of the vehicle.  

The security system has a built in memory card module to store the image of the 
owner and family members. During driving the camera will capture the image of the 
person who is driving and compare it with the original image. If both the images are 
matched perfectly then there is no problem. The image processing is done such that the 
skin tone provides a contrast between the face and the background and thus rotation or 
movement  of  face  is  not  taken  into  consideration.  If  the  car  is  theft  then  the  image 
processing plays a vital role. The thief photo is captured and it is compared with the 
photos available in the memory card and suspects that there is no perfect match. At this 
instant  the  GSM  module  is  alerted  such  that  the  photo  of  the  thief  is  sent  as  a 
multimedia  message  to  the  owner  as  well  as  to  the  nearest  police  station.  The  GPS 
tracker  will  track  the  location  and  speed  of  the  vehicle  and  immediately  alert  the 
nearest toll gate to issue that vehicle is stolen and to cease the vehicle.
