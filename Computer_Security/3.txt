ABSTRACT:

In the recent electronic world, we are facing various 
types of dangers to the confidentiality of information. 
The  information  is  saved  on  the  secondary  storage 
devices e. g. hard disks, compact disks, flash drives, 
floppy drives, etc. Some dangers are accidental, such 
as human error, while others are intended. Intended 
dangers are done by the persons for many reasons like 
causing harm, disturbance and other frauds. Among 
these frauds the common one is loss or theft of the 
storage devices. So, the majority of critical topics of 
computer world are security of information. 

It  is  focused  on  preventing  information  from  unau-
thorized access. Due to increase in the dangers to the 
important data which is possessed by the users and 
associations as the data loss results are shown in the 
thesis. There is a need of a robust solution to the dan-
ger  of  information  security.  But  everyone  has  their 
own benefits and limitations. Some are inconvenient 
to the users or others have technical faults. To protect 
and secure the data is very much vital than forever. 
The existing protected file systems are not well used 
by us. Cryptographic is the technique which is used to 
secure the computer systems. 

The encryption is the technique of the cryptography 
which is used and can  gratify the necessary security 
needs of the users for computing machines, internet, 
and the data beside varied dangers set. There are three 
main security assumptions. These are integrity, avail-
ability  and  the  confidentiality.  Our  main  focus  is  on 
improving the two characteristics of security namely 
confidentiality as well as availability, due to the loss of 
the information and the neglecting the services is the 
two biggest one attacks. 

I  INTRODUCTION:

This portion of the thesis will commence the defini-
tions  of  information,  and  information  security.  Also 
we  will  know  about  the  significance  of  information 
security and the penalties of information security, if 
we  will  compromise  it.  The  information  is  collected 
through the Data Loss DB (Open Security Foundation) 
association.

It  is  a  non-profitable  association  of  United  States. 
Data  Loss  DB  (http://datalossdb.org/)  is  a  project  of 
research of United States (but records also losses of 
worldwide data that include the United Kingdom and 
European countries) targeted to inform the events of 
losses of known data and world-wide retrieved. 

These are the society’s attempts to have knowledge 
about the great losses in the society. It is an open call 
to  the  society  by  the  association  that  demands  the 
contributors to contribute in their joint attempt to in-
troduce the novel events of the data losses.

When  information  is  not  protected  appropriate,  it 
may be impaired and is this as an information or secu-
rity breach well known. The penalties of an informa-
tion break are heavy. For commercialization, a breach 
requires usually gigantic financial punishments, luxuri-
ous law processes, loss of the call and business. 

For the personal point, a break to individuality steal-
ing and harm can lead at financial story or credit wor-
thiness. It takes so many years to recover from these 
breaks and is the gigantic costs.

In the starting year of study they were very less only 
10 incidents in the complete year which are to be con-
sidered  by  the  organization.  And  after  that  they  st 
increase till 2008, the year of highest number of inci-
dents takes place. 

There is slight down fall till the year 2010. But again 
they start to increase in the current year 2011. The re-
sults are till the month of September, there may be 
more one till the end of year.

1.2 Steganography:

Steganogrphy  is  another  way  to  protect  the  data 
from the intruders. The information is hided into the 
other images. It covers the vital information very ef-
ficiently that the intruders cannot easily recognize the 
available information. The terminology is taken from 
the  Greek  language.  It  is  the  art  for  communicating 
in which the availability of the communication is com-
pletely hidden. As we compare it with the cryptogra-
phy  where  the  intruders  are  permitted  to  see  or  in-
tercept or detect or modify the communicating data. 
In  the  case  of  this  technique  “Steganography”,  the 
intruders have no knowledge about the presence of 
the information.

Cryptographic goals. These are the basic aims for the 
security providers that are as follows. These are pri-
vacy of data (data confidentiality), integrity of data, 
user authenticity, and non-repudiation. The first three 
are also very well discussed in the first chapter which 
is named as “Introduction”.

 The confidentiality is also called as the privacy of the 
data. The applications which provide the confidential-
ity mean they are keeping the data or information in 
the reach of their permitted users. And keep away the 
unauthorized users. It has another name that is the 
secrecy of data or information. It is provided through 
the use of various methodologies.

 In it the physical security as well as the algorithmic 
conversions  takes  place.  2.  Integrity  of  data  tackles 
the  problems  of  data  alterations  or  data  modifica-
tions. For ensuring the integrity of the data, we must 
spot the manipulations of data done by the intruders. 
Any type of data modification can take place like inser-
tion of new data in between, or deletion of the exact 
data, or substitution of the communicated data.

1.1 Cryptography:

It is the learning of numerical practice narrated to fac-
ets of information protection for example authentica-
tion of entity and data source, confidentialism as well 
as integration of data . It does not merely provide the 
information protection, but it is also a set of mathe-
matical techniques. 

It is the exercise and revision of covering securely to 
the information. Recent cryptography interconnects 
the subjects of mathematical studies, computing tech-
nology, and electrical technology. The cryptographi-
cal  uses  comprise  Automatic  Telling  Machine  cards, 
passwords, and e-commerce. At the very early stage 
it was simply the cipher text that was the nonsense 
data that is not read by the intruders. 

It was only the simple conversion of the data to se-
cure it. As for example it was like, the original word 
“happy”, but after the treatment it was “ibqqz”. Now 
a  reasoning  person  can  easily  understand  the  data 
that it is the single character forward in the English al-
phabet. But some of the year passes it was much com-
plex that it is not possible for the reasoning person 
to understand the information. But the computer age 
grows more the processors with very high speeds. 

They can easily find the converted data to the original 
one.  It  becomes  the  challenge  for  the  cryptologists 
to think about much more accurate and high attach 
bearers algorithms must be developed by the math-
ematicians that the computers cannot resolve them 
easily. There was the use of encryption keys of small 
size but they are also sorted out easily by the intrud-
ers with the help of computers. 

Now there are so many algorithms which require the 
big size keys. At present there are the encryption keys 
of size 128 bytes, 152 bytes, and 256 bytes.

1.3 Electronic Codebook (ECB):
 
In this mode of operation, each block is encrypted in 
the same way. This is the simplest mode of operation 
to  implement,  and  is  easy  to  do  in  parallel  because 
there  are  no  inter-block  dependencies.  The  encryp-
tion simply runs the cipher block algorithm on each 
block  in  the  data;  see  Figure  3.4  for  the  encrypting 
procedure, and the decrypting procedure. 

This means that two identical plain texts will be en-
crypted to identical cipher texts. As mentioned it has 
a severe problem with security. We see in Figure 3.4 
that  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  the  original  picture, 
and this shows that the encryption with ECB in some 
cases is not sufficient. One should however, note that 
even though ECB looks random, it is not a guarantee 
that the encryption is secure.

The  electronic  media  is  controlled  for  the  file  to  be 
stored on it in an efficient way. The media may be of 
any type like floppy disk, compact disk, hard disk, flash 
drives, etc. It has a very clear working at the very first 
look. But it not only stores the data, it also protects 
them from any type of hazards. There are so many file 
systems  which  are  one  the  multiuser  operating  sys-
tems like UNIX operating system. 

In such type of configurations the task becomes more 
typical to handle all the files of many users on a single 
storage space. For a perfect file system it is mandato-
ry to cover the following tasks Totally control the elec-
tronic media which is very novel and it has not been 
maintained previously, The storage is utilized by the 
many processes which are the simultaneous one, In-
trinsic synchronization is needed for all the processes 
on the system, The security and the protection are en-
forced that permits the comfortable data accessing, 
Management of the independent files by many pro-
cess simultaneously, Differentiating of the problems 
within the physical media or rude use of the access-
ing ways by the operating system. It controls the data 
that has been lost because of hardware problems, An 
ordinary collection of the interface functioning must 
be given to the layers which are above of the file sys-
tem in the operating system.  

II  FILE SYSTEM:

It is the way to store and access the stored data in the 
form of files that may be information or executatble 
programs.  This  chapter  covers  the  high-level  details 
of  file  systems  and  the  concerned  matters  like  the 
caches  of  the  storage  devices,  the  interfaces  of  the 
file  systems,  and  the  user-oriented  Application  Pro-
gramming  Interfaces  which  utilizes  the  file  systems 
characteristics. This chapter will highlight the working 
of the file systems. 

It is the main part of the OS. It is used to create, ma-
nipulate, store, and retrieve data. At the highest level, 
a file system is a way to manage information on a sec-
ondary storage medium. There are so many layers un-
der and above the file system. 

All the layers are to be fully described here. This paper 
will give the explanatory knowledge of the file system 
designers and the researchers in the area. Any file sys-
tem is an important component of the operating sys-
tems. It is utilized to handle the storage devices.

There may be many types of categories of the hard 
disk drives. These may be arbitrary accessing, digital 
nature, magnetic nature, and the non-volatile. In nine-
teen hundred and fifty six, the International Business 
Machine launched the hard disks. There are numerous 
names  for  the  hard  disk  drives  like  hard  drive,  hard 
disk, disk drive etc. This device is utilized to store and 
access the digital data or information. It is a perma-
nent storage media. It has one or more numbers of 
the discs which are also known as the platters. These 
platters are furred using the magnetic material.

ABSTRACT:

In the recent electronic world, we are facing various 
types of dangers to the confidentiality of information. 
The  information  is  saved  on  the  secondary  storage 
devices e. g. hard disks, compact disks, flash drives, 
floppy drives, etc. Some dangers are accidental, such 
as human error, while others are intended. Intended 
dangers are done by the persons for many reasons like 
causing harm, disturbance and other frauds. Among 
these frauds the common one is loss or theft of the 
storage devices. So, the majority of critical topics of 
computer world are security of information. 

It  is  focused  on  preventing  information  from  unau-
thorized access. Due to increase in the dangers to the 
important data which is possessed by the users and 
associations as the data loss results are shown in the 
thesis. There is a need of a robust solution to the dan-
ger  of  information  security.  But  everyone  has  their 
own benefits and limitations. Some are inconvenient 
to the users or others have technical faults. To protect 
and secure the data is very much vital than forever. 
The existing protected file systems are not well used 
by us. Cryptographic is the technique which is used to 
secure the computer systems. 

The encryption is the technique of the cryptography 
which is used and can  gratify the necessary security 
needs of the users for computing machines, internet, 
and the data beside varied dangers set. There are three 
main security assumptions. These are integrity, avail-
ability  and  the  confidentiality.  Our  main  focus  is  on 
improving the two characteristics of security namely 
confidentiality as well as availability, due to the loss of 
the information and the neglecting the services is the 
two biggest one attacks. 

I  INTRODUCTION:

This portion of the thesis will commence the defini-
tions  of  information,  and  information  security.  Also 
we  will  know  about  the  significance  of  information 
security and the penalties of information security, if 
we  will  compromise  it.  The  information  is  collected 
through the Data Loss DB (Open Security Foundation) 
association.

It  is  a  non-profitable  association  of  United  States. 
Data  Loss  DB  (http://datalossdb.org/)  is  a  project  of 
research of United States (but records also losses of 
worldwide data that include the United Kingdom and 
European countries) targeted to inform the events of 
losses of known data and world-wide retrieved. 

These are the society’s attempts to have knowledge 
about the great losses in the society. It is an open call 
to  the  society  by  the  association  that  demands  the 
contributors to contribute in their joint attempt to in-
troduce the novel events of the data losses.

When  information  is  not  protected  appropriate,  it 
may be impaired and is this as an information or secu-
rity breach well known. The penalties of an informa-
tion break are heavy. For commercialization, a breach 
requires usually gigantic financial punishments, luxuri-
ous law processes, loss of the call and business. 

For the personal point, a break to individuality steal-
ing and harm can lead at financial story or credit wor-
thiness. It takes so many years to recover from these 
breaks and is the gigantic costs.

In the starting year of study they were very less only 
10 incidents in the complete year which are to be con-
sidered  by  the  organization.  And  after  that  they  st 
increase till 2008, the year of highest number of inci-
dents takes place. 

There is slight down fall till the year 2010. But again 
they start to increase in the current year 2011. The re-
sults are till the month of September, there may be 
more one till the end of year.

1.2 Steganography:

Steganogrphy  is  another  way  to  protect  the  data 
from the intruders. The information is hided into the 
other images. It covers the vital information very ef-
ficiently that the intruders cannot easily recognize the 
available information. The terminology is taken from 
the  Greek  language.  It  is  the  art  for  communicating 
in which the availability of the communication is com-
pletely hidden. As we compare it with the cryptogra-
phy  where  the  intruders  are  permitted  to  see  or  in-
tercept or detect or modify the communicating data. 
In  the  case  of  this  technique  “Steganography”,  the 
intruders have no knowledge about the presence of 
the information.

Cryptographic goals. These are the basic aims for the 
security providers that are as follows. These are pri-
vacy of data (data confidentiality), integrity of data, 
user authenticity, and non-repudiation. The first three 
are also very well discussed in the first chapter which 
is named as “Introduction”.

 The confidentiality is also called as the privacy of the 
data. The applications which provide the confidential-
ity mean they are keeping the data or information in 
the reach of their permitted users. And keep away the 
unauthorized users. It has another name that is the 
secrecy of data or information. It is provided through 
the use of various methodologies.

 In it the physical security as well as the algorithmic 
conversions  takes  place.  2.  Integrity  of  data  tackles 
the  problems  of  data  alterations  or  data  modifica-
tions. For ensuring the integrity of the data, we must 
spot the manipulations of data done by the intruders. 
Any type of data modification can take place like inser-
tion of new data in between, or deletion of the exact 
data, or substitution of the communicated data.

1.1 Cryptography:

It is the learning of numerical practice narrated to fac-
ets of information protection for example authentica-
tion of entity and data source, confidentialism as well 
as integration of data . It does not merely provide the 
information protection, but it is also a set of mathe-
matical techniques. 

It is the exercise and revision of covering securely to 
the information. Recent cryptography interconnects 
the subjects of mathematical studies, computing tech-
nology, and electrical technology. The cryptographi-
cal  uses  comprise  Automatic  Telling  Machine  cards, 
passwords, and e-commerce. At the very early stage 
it was simply the cipher text that was the nonsense 
data that is not read by the intruders. 

It was only the simple conversion of the data to se-
cure it. As for example it was like, the original word 
“happy”, but after the treatment it was “ibqqz”. Now 
a  reasoning  person  can  easily  understand  the  data 
that it is the single character forward in the English al-
phabet. But some of the year passes it was much com-
plex that it is not possible for the reasoning person 
to understand the information. But the computer age 
grows more the processors with very high speeds. 

They can easily find the converted data to the original 
one.  It  becomes  the  challenge  for  the  cryptologists 
to think about much more accurate and high attach 
bearers algorithms must be developed by the math-
ematicians that the computers cannot resolve them 
easily. There was the use of encryption keys of small 
size but they are also sorted out easily by the intrud-
ers with the help of computers. 

Now there are so many algorithms which require the 
big size keys. At present there are the encryption keys 
of size 128 bytes, 152 bytes, and 256 bytes.

1.3 Electronic Codebook (ECB):
 
In this mode of operation, each block is encrypted in 
the same way. This is the simplest mode of operation 
to  implement,  and  is  easy  to  do  in  parallel  because 
there  are  no  inter-block  dependencies.  The  encryp-
tion simply runs the cipher block algorithm on each 
block  in  the  data;  see  Figure  3.4  for  the  encrypting 
procedure, and the decrypting procedure. 

This means that two identical plain texts will be en-
crypted to identical cipher texts. As mentioned it has 
a severe problem with security. We see in Figure 3.4 
that  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  the  original  picture, 
and this shows that the encryption with ECB in some 
cases is not sufficient. One should however, note that 
even though ECB looks random, it is not a guarantee 
that the encryption is secure.

The  electronic  media  is  controlled  for  the  file  to  be 
stored on it in an efficient way. The media may be of 
any type like floppy disk, compact disk, hard disk, flash 
drives, etc. It has a very clear working at the very first 
look. But it not only stores the data, it also protects 
them from any type of hazards. There are so many file 
systems  which  are  one  the  multiuser  operating  sys-
tems like UNIX operating system. 

In such type of configurations the task becomes more 
typical to handle all the files of many users on a single 
storage space. For a perfect file system it is mandato-
ry to cover the following tasks Totally control the elec-
tronic media which is very novel and it has not been 
maintained previously, The storage is utilized by the 
many processes which are the simultaneous one, In-
trinsic synchronization is needed for all the processes 
on the system, The security and the protection are en-
forced that permits the comfortable data accessing, 
Management of the independent files by many pro-
cess simultaneously, Differentiating of the problems 
within the physical media or rude use of the access-
ing ways by the operating system. It controls the data 
that has been lost because of hardware problems, An 
ordinary collection of the interface functioning must 
be given to the layers which are above of the file sys-
tem in the operating system.  

II  FILE SYSTEM:

It is the way to store and access the stored data in the 
form of files that may be information or executatble 
programs.  This  chapter  covers  the  high-level  details 
of  file  systems  and  the  concerned  matters  like  the 
caches  of  the  storage  devices,  the  interfaces  of  the 
file  systems,  and  the  user-oriented  Application  Pro-
gramming  Interfaces  which  utilizes  the  file  systems 
characteristics. This chapter will highlight the working 
of the file systems. 

It is the main part of the OS. It is used to create, ma-
nipulate, store, and retrieve data. At the highest level, 
a file system is a way to manage information on a sec-
ondary storage medium. There are so many layers un-
der and above the file system. 

All the layers are to be fully described here. This paper 
will give the explanatory knowledge of the file system 
designers and the researchers in the area. Any file sys-
tem is an important component of the operating sys-
tems. It is utilized to handle the storage devices.

There may be many types of categories of the hard 
disk drives. These may be arbitrary accessing, digital 
nature, magnetic nature, and the non-volatile. In nine-
teen hundred and fifty six, the International Business 
Machine launched the hard disks. There are numerous 
names  for  the  hard  disk  drives  like  hard  drive,  hard 
disk, disk drive etc. This device is utilized to store and 
access the digital data or information. It is a perma-
nent storage media. It has one or more numbers of 
the discs which are also known as the platters. These 
platters are furred using the magnetic material.

                 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL & MAGAZINE OF ENGINEERING, TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH                                        October 2014

            Volume No: 1(2014), Issue No: 10 (October)                                 ISSN No: 2348-4845

These have some of the well arranged magnetic heads 
which are used for storing and accessing the data on 
the hard disk drives. Every platter has one or two sur-
faces for storage of the data.  of the basic terminol-
ogy is described here in this section which is used for 
the harddisks. In the Fig. 4.2, the basic components of 
the hard drive are displayed. 

There is more than one platter in the hard drive. One 
or both of the surfaces are furred with the magnetic 
material. This magnetic material is used for the data 
storage. Every surface of the platters has on read and 
write head hovering on it. It is utilized for examining 
or recording of the data. A common axis is used for ro-
tating all the platters. Usually the rotation speed is in 
between fifty four hundreds or seventy two hundreds 
numbers of rotations per minute. 

There are also the higher performance hard disks in 
the market and their costs also increases with better 
speeds. The older versions of the hard disks have the 
less revolution speeds. The movements of the head 
are done along the radius of the platters. It is the com-
bination of the movements done by the rotation head 
and the rotations of the platters. 

There is a communication between the processor and 
the hard disk with the help of the disk controller that 
has been discussed previously. This hides the working 
of the drive from the rest of the applications. While 
the disk controllers for diverse kind of disk drives are 
prepared for the use of the similar interface. The con-
troller is also utilized to work for other kind of jobs.

These are like the caching or removing of the bad sec-
tors.  From  the  above  readings  we  can  easily  know 
the hardware workings. There are more concepts like 
the motor that is used to rotate the platters and the 
movements of the heads backward or forward. The 
electronics  is  used  to  maintain  all  the  operations  of 
the mechanical components. But there is no need to 
know such workings for us of the hard drive.

DiskController:

A storage device is the fundamental part of any com-
puter system. Usually every computer system has the 
following  storage  media  Floppy  disk  drive,Hard  disk 
drive,CD-ROM  disk  drive,DVD  disk  drive  USB  flash 
drive All the devices are interconnected with the com-
puter with the help of the IDE (Integrated Drive Elec-
tronics) interface. . Basically it is the normal path for 
the storage media to interconnect with the computer 
system. This is not the actual interface name as the 
IDE. The unique name for the same interface is the Ad-
vanced Technology Attachment (ATA). 

It  was  developed  for  the  IBM  AT  machine.  Basically 
the disk controller is a circuitry that is enabled with 
the processor for communicating with the all types of 
disks (hard, floppy, DVD, CD, etc.). There are so many 
types of disk controllers available in the market. Some 
of these are like Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE) as 
well as Small computer system interconnects (SCSI). 
The  IDE  controllers  are  utilized  in  the  desktop  com-
puters or personal computers or the standalone com-
puters. Whereas the SCSI is utilized in soaring end per-
sonal computers, workstations for professionals and 
network file servers. All the disk controllers have their 
own individual processors with independent Random 
Access Memory buffers. There is also the availability 
of the Programmable Read Only Memory.

any type like floppy disk, compact disk, hard disk, flash 
drives, etc. It has a very clear working at the very first 
look. But it not only stores the data, it also protects 
them from any type of hazards. There are so many file 
systems  which  are  one  the  multiuser  operating  sys-
tems like UNIX operating system. 

In such type of configurations the task becomes more 
typical to handle all the files of many users on a single 
storage space. For a perfect file system it is mandato-
ry to cover the following tasks Totally control the elec-
tronic media which is very novel and it has not been 
maintained previously, The storage is utilized by the 
many processes which are the simultaneous one, In-
trinsic synchronization is needed for all the processes 
on the system, The security and the protection are en-
forced that permits the comfortable data accessing, 
Management of the independent files by many pro-
cess simultaneously, Differentiating of the problems 
within the physical media or rude use of the access-
ing ways by the operating system. It controls the data 
that has been lost because of hardware problems, An 
ordinary collection of the interface functioning must 
be given to the layers which are above of the file sys-
tem in the operating system.  

II  FILE SYSTEM:

It is the way to store and access the stored data in the 
form of files that may be information or executatble 
programs.  This  chapter  covers  the  high-level  details 
of  file  systems  and  the  concerned  matters  like  the 
caches  of  the  storage  devices,  the  interfaces  of  the 
file  systems,  and  the  user-oriented  Application  Pro-
gramming  Interfaces  which  utilizes  the  file  systems 
characteristics. This chapter will highlight the working 
of the file systems. 

It is the main part of the OS. It is used to create, ma-
nipulate, store, and retrieve data. At the highest level, 
a file system is a way to manage information on a sec-
ondary storage medium. There are so many layers un-
der and above the file system. 

All the layers are to be fully described here. This paper 
will give the explanatory knowledge of the file system 
designers and the researchers in the area. Any file sys-
tem is an important component of the operating sys-
tems. It is utilized to handle the storage devices.

There may be many types of categories of the hard 
disk drives. These may be arbitrary accessing, digital 
nature, magnetic nature, and the non-volatile. In nine-
teen hundred and fifty six, the International Business 
Machine launched the hard disks. There are numerous 
names  for  the  hard  disk  drives  like  hard  drive,  hard 
disk, disk drive etc. This device is utilized to store and 
access the digital data or information. It is a perma-
nent storage media. It has one or more numbers of 
the discs which are also known as the platters. These 
platters are furred using the magnetic material.

These have some of the well arranged magnetic heads 
which are used for storing and accessing the data on 
the hard disk drives. Every platter has one or two sur-
faces for storage of the data.  of the basic terminol-
ogy is described here in this section which is used for 
the harddisks. In the Fig. 4.2, the basic components of 
the hard drive are displayed. 

There is more than one platter in the hard drive. One 
or both of the surfaces are furred with the magnetic 
material. This magnetic material is used for the data 
storage. Every surface of the platters has on read and 
write head hovering on it. It is utilized for examining 
or recording of the data. A common axis is used for ro-
tating all the platters. Usually the rotation speed is in 
between fifty four hundreds or seventy two hundreds 
numbers of rotations per minute. 

There are also the higher performance hard disks in 
the market and their costs also increases with better 
speeds. The older versions of the hard disks have the 
less revolution speeds. The movements of the head 
are done along the radius of the platters. It is the com-
bination of the movements done by the rotation head 
and the rotations of the platters. 

There is a communication between the processor and 
the hard disk with the help of the disk controller that 
has been discussed previously. This hides the working 
of the drive from the rest of the applications. While 
the disk controllers for diverse kind of disk drives are 
prepared for the use of the similar interface. The con-
troller is also utilized to work for other kind of jobs.

These are like the caching or removing of the bad sec-
tors.  From  the  above  readings  we  can  easily  know 
the hardware workings. There are more concepts like 
the motor that is used to rotate the platters and the 
movements of the heads backward or forward. The 
electronics  is  used  to  maintain  all  the  operations  of 
the mechanical components. But there is no need to 
know such workings for us of the hard drive.

DiskController:

A storage device is the fundamental part of any com-
puter system. Usually every computer system has the 
following  storage  media  Floppy  disk  drive,Hard  disk 
drive,CD-ROM  disk  drive,DVD  disk  drive  USB  flash 
drive All the devices are interconnected with the com-
puter with the help of the IDE (Integrated Drive Elec-
tronics) interface. . Basically it is the normal path for 
the storage media to interconnect with the computer 
system. This is not the actual interface name as the 
IDE. The unique name for the same interface is the Ad-
vanced Technology Attachment (ATA). 

It  was  developed  for  the  IBM  AT  machine.  Basically 
the disk controller is a circuitry that is enabled with 
the processor for communicating with the all types of 
disks (hard, floppy, DVD, CD, etc.). There are so many 
types of disk controllers available in the market. Some 
of these are like Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE) as 
well as Small computer system interconnects (SCSI). 
The  IDE  controllers  are  utilized  in  the  desktop  com-
puters or personal computers or the standalone com-
puters. Whereas the SCSI is utilized in soaring end per-
sonal computers, workstations for professionals and 
network file servers. All the disk controllers have their 
own individual processors with independent Random 
Access Memory buffers. There is also the availability 
of the Programmable Read Only Memory.

When we use the operating system, we have to se-
cure some important data. The date is always stored 
in the files, so we secure the important files well. To 
check the proposed functionality, we experiment the 
above said system on the Windows operating system. 
With these experiments, we have found that the pro-
posed  system  is  working  properly,  according  to  the 
needs of the users.

The access control is one of the fundamental security 
services  in  the  computer  system.  It  is  a  mechanism 
for  constraining  the  interaction  between  users  and 
protected resources. File is one of the important re-
sources of the computer system. That must be pro-
tected from the unauthorized access that it can’t be 
tempered or stolen by intruders. The file security can 
enforced  using  cryptographic  techniques.  With  the 
help of these techniques the important files are enci-
phered as well as authorization of consumers are pro-
vided suitable encryption keys. 

The cryptographic techniques can be applied at any 
level of the storage systems because they use the lay-
ered architecture. The level may be the block or virtu-
al one in the operating system. Basically, file manage-
ment  is  an  important  task  of  the  computer  system. 
The suggested file security system storing encrypted 
files using Rijndael Algorithm (AES), so an unauthor-
ized user can’t access the important data. 

The encryption takes place for the selected files (im-
portant  ones  which  requires  the  security)  only.  We 
are using the concept of on-demand computing which 
results in the high performance of the computer sys-
tem. The proposed system is working properly for all 
types of the files. In this chapter there are more sec-
tions. Next section is section II which is about the re-
lated works. In section III, the design of the system is 
shown. In section IV, the evaluation is done. In section 
V, there is conclusion.

III USER PROCESS FILE SYSTEM:

The idea of developing a file system as a user process 
is appealing for a variety of reasons not least of which 
being that it is simpler than other techniques. By de-
veloping the file system as a user level process, the 
complexity of kernel level programming can be avoid-
ed.  This  simplifies  the  development  process  enor-
mously, as developing in the kernel is more restrictive 
than user level development. 

The standard development, debugging tools and pro-
gramming libraries can be used. This helps to reduce 
the time required to implement the file system. One 
of  the  most  advantages  of  developing  a  file  system 
as a user level process is that the file system can be 
installed by a user without the assistance of a system 
administrator. This provides the user with greater flex-
ibility in how they use files. Figure 4.4 illustrates how 
a file system developed to run in user space interacts 
with the local and remote operating systems. A user 
process requests access to a file from a user-space file 
system. The request is routed through the kernel. 

STORAGE  ENCRYPTION  AND  JAVA  FILE  SE-
CURITY SYSTEM:

Nowadays,  the  attacks  are  going  to  increase  at  the 
storage  data  systems.  So  the  security  systems  are 
going to turn into a compulsory attribute of any stor-
age  data  system.  For  the  security  purpose  we  are 
always  dependent  on  the  cryptography  techniques. 
These techniques take the performance costs for the 
complete system. So we have proposed the Java File 
Security System(JFSS). It is based on the on-demand 
computing  system  concept,  because  of  the  perfor-
mance issues. It is a greate comback for the system 
performance.

The  concept  is  used  because,  we  are  not  always  in 
need the secure the files, but the selected one only. 
The concerned chapter shows the design of the Java 
File Security System on WindowsXP.

ABSTRACT:

In the recent electronic world, we are facing various 
types of dangers to the confidentiality of information. 
The  information  is  saved  on  the  secondary  storage 
devices e. g. hard disks, compact disks, flash drives, 
floppy drives, etc. Some dangers are accidental, such 
as human error, while others are intended. Intended 
dangers are done by the persons for many reasons like 
causing harm, disturbance and other frauds. Among 
these frauds the common one is loss or theft of the 
storage devices. So, the majority of critical topics of 
computer world are security of information. 

It  is  focused  on  preventing  information  from  unau-
thorized access. Due to increase in the dangers to the 
important data which is possessed by the users and 
associations as the data loss results are shown in the 
thesis. There is a need of a robust solution to the dan-
ger  of  information  security.  But  everyone  has  their 
own benefits and limitations. Some are inconvenient 
to the users or others have technical faults. To protect 
and secure the data is very much vital than forever. 
The existing protected file systems are not well used 
by us. Cryptographic is the technique which is used to 
secure the computer systems. 

The encryption is the technique of the cryptography 
which is used and can  gratify the necessary security 
needs of the users for computing machines, internet, 
and the data beside varied dangers set. There are three 
main security assumptions. These are integrity, avail-
ability  and  the  confidentiality.  Our  main  focus  is  on 
improving the two characteristics of security namely 
confidentiality as well as availability, due to the loss of 
the information and the neglecting the services is the 
two biggest one attacks. 

I  INTRODUCTION:

This portion of the thesis will commence the defini-
tions  of  information,  and  information  security.  Also 
we  will  know  about  the  significance  of  information 
security and the penalties of information security, if 
we  will  compromise  it.  The  information  is  collected 
through the Data Loss DB (Open Security Foundation) 
association.

It  is  a  non-profitable  association  of  United  States. 
Data  Loss  DB  (http://datalossdb.org/)  is  a  project  of 
research of United States (but records also losses of 
worldwide data that include the United Kingdom and 
European countries) targeted to inform the events of 
losses of known data and world-wide retrieved. 

These are the society’s attempts to have knowledge 
about the great losses in the society. It is an open call 
to  the  society  by  the  association  that  demands  the 
contributors to contribute in their joint attempt to in-
troduce the novel events of the data losses.

When  information  is  not  protected  appropriate,  it 
may be impaired and is this as an information or secu-
rity breach well known. The penalties of an informa-
tion break are heavy. For commercialization, a breach 
requires usually gigantic financial punishments, luxuri-
ous law processes, loss of the call and business. 

For the personal point, a break to individuality steal-
ing and harm can lead at financial story or credit wor-
thiness. It takes so many years to recover from these 
breaks and is the gigantic costs.

In the starting year of study they were very less only 
10 incidents in the complete year which are to be con-
sidered  by  the  organization.  And  after  that  they  st 
increase till 2008, the year of highest number of inci-
dents takes place. 

There is slight down fall till the year 2010. But again 
they start to increase in the current year 2011. The re-
sults are till the month of September, there may be 
more one till the end of year.

1.2 Steganography:

Steganogrphy  is  another  way  to  protect  the  data 
from the intruders. The information is hided into the 
other images. It covers the vital information very ef-
ficiently that the intruders cannot easily recognize the 
available information. The terminology is taken from 
the  Greek  language.  It  is  the  art  for  communicating 
in which the availability of the communication is com-
pletely hidden. As we compare it with the cryptogra-
phy  where  the  intruders  are  permitted  to  see  or  in-
tercept or detect or modify the communicating data. 
In  the  case  of  this  technique  “Steganography”,  the 
intruders have no knowledge about the presence of 
the information.

Cryptographic goals. These are the basic aims for the 
security providers that are as follows. These are pri-
vacy of data (data confidentiality), integrity of data, 
user authenticity, and non-repudiation. The first three 
are also very well discussed in the first chapter which 
is named as “Introduction”.

 The confidentiality is also called as the privacy of the 
data. The applications which provide the confidential-
ity mean they are keeping the data or information in 
the reach of their permitted users. And keep away the 
unauthorized users. It has another name that is the 
secrecy of data or information. It is provided through 
the use of various methodologies.

 In it the physical security as well as the algorithmic 
conversions  takes  place.  2.  Integrity  of  data  tackles 
the  problems  of  data  alterations  or  data  modifica-
tions. For ensuring the integrity of the data, we must 
spot the manipulations of data done by the intruders. 
Any type of data modification can take place like inser-
tion of new data in between, or deletion of the exact 
data, or substitution of the communicated data.

1.1 Cryptography:

It is the learning of numerical practice narrated to fac-
ets of information protection for example authentica-
tion of entity and data source, confidentialism as well 
as integration of data . It does not merely provide the 
information protection, but it is also a set of mathe-
matical techniques. 

It is the exercise and revision of covering securely to 
the information. Recent cryptography interconnects 
the subjects of mathematical studies, computing tech-
nology, and electrical technology. The cryptographi-
cal  uses  comprise  Automatic  Telling  Machine  cards, 
passwords, and e-commerce. At the very early stage 
it was simply the cipher text that was the nonsense 
data that is not read by the intruders. 

It was only the simple conversion of the data to se-
cure it. As for example it was like, the original word 
“happy”, but after the treatment it was “ibqqz”. Now 
a  reasoning  person  can  easily  understand  the  data 
that it is the single character forward in the English al-
phabet. But some of the year passes it was much com-
plex that it is not possible for the reasoning person 
to understand the information. But the computer age 
grows more the processors with very high speeds. 

They can easily find the converted data to the original 
one.  It  becomes  the  challenge  for  the  cryptologists 
to think about much more accurate and high attach 
bearers algorithms must be developed by the math-
ematicians that the computers cannot resolve them 
easily. There was the use of encryption keys of small 
size but they are also sorted out easily by the intrud-
ers with the help of computers. 

Now there are so many algorithms which require the 
big size keys. At present there are the encryption keys 
of size 128 bytes, 152 bytes, and 256 bytes.

1.3 Electronic Codebook (ECB):
 
In this mode of operation, each block is encrypted in 
the same way. This is the simplest mode of operation 
to  implement,  and  is  easy  to  do  in  parallel  because 
there  are  no  inter-block  dependencies.  The  encryp-
tion simply runs the cipher block algorithm on each 
block  in  the  data;  see  Figure  3.4  for  the  encrypting 
procedure, and the decrypting procedure. 

This means that two identical plain texts will be en-
crypted to identical cipher texts. As mentioned it has 
a severe problem with security. We see in Figure 3.4 
that  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  the  original  picture, 
and this shows that the encryption with ECB in some 
cases is not sufficient. One should however, note that 
even though ECB looks random, it is not a guarantee 
that the encryption is secure.

The  electronic  media  is  controlled  for  the  file  to  be 
stored on it in an efficient way. The media may be of 
any type like floppy disk, compact disk, hard disk, flash 
drives, etc. It has a very clear working at the very first

electronics  is  used  to  maintain  all  the  operations  of 
the mechanical components. But there is no need to 
know such workings for us of the hard drive.

DiskController:

A storage device is the fundamental part of any com-
puter system. Usually every computer system has the 
following  storage  media  Floppy  disk  drive,Hard  disk 
drive,CD-ROM  disk  drive,DVD  disk  drive  USB  flash 
drive All the devices are interconnected with the com-
puter with the help of the IDE (Integrated Drive Elec-
tronics) interface. . Basically it is the normal path for 
the storage media to interconnect with the computer 
system. This is not the actual interface name as the 
IDE. The unique name for the same interface is the Ad-
vanced Technology Attachment (ATA). 

It  was  developed  for  the  IBM  AT  machine.  Basically 
the disk controller is a circuitry that is enabled with 
the processor for communicating with the all types of 
disks (hard, floppy, DVD, CD, etc.). There are so many 
types of disk controllers available in the market. Some 
of these are like Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE) as 
well as Small computer system interconnects (SCSI). 
The  IDE  controllers  are  utilized  in  the  desktop  com-
puters or personal computers or the standalone com-
puters. Whereas the SCSI is utilized in soaring end per-
sonal computers, workstations for professionals and 
network file servers. All the disk controllers have their 
own individual processors with independent Random 
Access Memory buffers. There is also the availability 
of the Programmable Read Only Memory.

When we use the operating system, we have to se-
cure some important data. The date is always stored 
in the files, so we secure the important files well. To 
check the proposed functionality, we experiment the 
above said system on the Windows operating system. 
With these experiments, we have found that the pro-
posed  system  is  working  properly,  according  to  the 
needs of the users.

The access control is one of the fundamental security 
services  in  the  computer  system.  It  is  a  mechanism 
for  constraining  the  interaction  between  users  and 
protected resources. File is one of the important re-
sources of the computer system. That must be pro-
tected from the unauthorized access that it can’t be 
tempered or stolen by intruders. The file security can 
enforced  using  cryptographic  techniques.  With  the 
help of these techniques the important files are enci-
phered as well as authorization of consumers are pro-
vided suitable encryption keys. 

The cryptographic techniques can be applied at any 
level of the storage systems because they use the lay-
ered architecture. The level may be the block or virtu-
al one in the operating system. Basically, file manage-
ment  is  an  important  task  of  the  computer  system. 
The suggested file security system storing encrypted 
files using Rijndael Algorithm (AES), so an unauthor-
ized user can’t access the important data. 

The encryption takes place for the selected files (im-
portant  ones  which  requires  the  security)  only.  We 
are using the concept of on-demand computing which 
results in the high performance of the computer sys-
tem. The proposed system is working properly for all 
types of the files. In this chapter there are more sec-
tions. Next section is section II which is about the re-
lated works. In section III, the design of the system is 
shown. In section IV, the evaluation is done. In section 
V, there is conclusion.

III USER PROCESS FILE SYSTEM:

The idea of developing a file system as a user process 
is appealing for a variety of reasons not least of which 
being that it is simpler than other techniques. By de-
veloping the file system as a user level process, the 
complexity of kernel level programming can be avoid-
ed.  This  simplifies  the  development  process  enor-
mously, as developing in the kernel is more restrictive 
than user level development. 

The standard development, debugging tools and pro-
gramming libraries can be used. This helps to reduce 
the time required to implement the file system. One 
of  the  most  advantages  of  developing  a  file  system 
as a user level process is that the file system can be 
installed by a user without the assistance of a system 
administrator. This provides the user with greater flex-
ibility in how they use files. Figure 4.4 illustrates how 
a file system developed to run in user space interacts 
with the local and remote operating systems. A user 
process requests access to a file from a user-space file 
system. The request is routed through the kernel. 

STORAGE  ENCRYPTION  AND  JAVA  FILE  SE-
CURITY SYSTEM:

Nowadays,  the  attacks  are  going  to  increase  at  the 
storage  data  systems.  So  the  security  systems  are 
going to turn into a compulsory attribute of any stor-
age  data  system.  For  the  security  purpose  we  are 
always  dependent  on  the  cryptography  techniques. 
These techniques take the performance costs for the 
complete system. So we have proposed the Java File 
Security System(JFSS). It is based on the on-demand 
computing  system  concept,  because  of  the  perfor-
mance issues. It is a greate comback for the system 
performance.

The  concept  is  used  because,  we  are  not  always  in 
need the secure the files, but the selected one only. 
The concerned chapter shows the design of the Java 
File Security System on WindowsXP.

TOWARDS  THE  FILE  SYSTEMS  PERFOR-
MANCE

IV EVALUATION FRAMEWORKS:

This is the era of High Performance Computing (HPC). 
There  is  a  great  demand  of  the  best  performance 
evaluation techniques for the file systems. The task of 
evaluation is both necessary and hard. It gives in depth 
analysis of the target system and that becomes the 
decision points for the users. That is also helpful for 
the inventors or developers to find out the bottleneck 
in  their  systems.  In  this  chapter  many  performance 
evaluation techniques are described for file and stor-
age system evaluation and the main stress is given on 
the important one that is replay traces. 

A survey has been done for the performance evalua-
tion techniques used by the researchers and on the 
replay traces. And the taxonomy of the replay traces 
is  described.  The  some  of  the  popular  replay  traces 
are just like, Tracefs, //Trace, Replayfs and VFS Inter-
ceptor. At last we have concluded all the features that 
must  be  considered  when  we  are  going  to  develop 
the new tool for the replay traces. 

The  complete  work  of  this  chapter  shows  that  the 
storage  system  developers  must  care  about  all  the 
techniques  which  are  utilized  for  the  evaluations  of 
the file storage systems. So they can develop highly 
efficient future file systems. File and storage system 
designs are being proposed in a little span of time be-
cause there is no robust file system is available which 
can perform all the functionalities according to the al-
ways changing user needs. 

Every user has their specific needs or demands which 
are not common at all. One user may ask for the secure 
file system because he/she has important information 
that must be protected from the others which are not 
authorized. Some are demanding for highly portable 
file systems. Considering all these a novel Java File Se-
curity  System  (JFSS)  has  been  developed.  One  user 
demands for the energy efficient file systems because 
he/she is using portable devices.

 Because of such diverse requirements by the users it 
isvery typical to develop a robust file storage system. 
Consequently  a  lot  of  diverse  kinds  of  file  storage 
systems are available. The user has to choose one of 
them which are suitable for them. Here the question 
is which one is better for the selection? To make this 
judgment we require theevaluation tools. These tools 
are to be applied by the researchers on the file sys-
tems under study for the performance evaluation..

VI Conclusion:

Java File Security System (JFSS) offers an answer to 
the file storage system’s main problems like the dif-
ficulty in the portability. This file storage security sys-
tem is designed for single operating system as well as 
grouped in the previously loaded Virtual Machine. The 
users can execute the JFSS on any operating system. 
It can be utilized as a file storage system. We have pre-
sented a JFSS design with minimal performance over-
heads because of ondemand computing and notice-
able semantic alterations for users. 

File storage system semantics are preserved exclusive 
of file system alterations, therefore supports the exist-
ing file storage systems performances. We have con-
tributed in designing and enlargement of a user space 
cryptographic file storage system. We have balanced 
the  design  goals  like  security,  performance,  conve-
nient  and  independability  of  the  system.  We  have 
achieved the high security by including the support of 
the Rijndeal Algorithm (AES) and we have saved the 
keys on the portable smart cards for the documents 
which are important. 

The performance is achieved with the help of on-de-
mand computing concept which is that we are not go-
ing to encrypt all the files on the computer system, 
but we are going to encrypt only the important docu-
ments only. It saves the performance overhead of the 
system. The system is very convenient to the users. 
And the independability is attained by the novel Java 
technology which is highly portable. So the complete 
system is a highly independent of the configuration. 
At the end of thesis, I would like to conclude that my 
design goals in the research have been achieved well. 

The proposed system has better system performance 
as well as expands it for the existing file system. It is 
an independent File System (it does not require the 
modifications in the other file systems or user appli-
cations). It offers strong storage protection alongside 
of the very unimportant and reasonable attacks. It is 
compatible  with  the  future  technology  for  separate 
key management just like smart cards for storing the 
encryption keys which are directly in the possession 
of authorized users. 

It is compatible with the existing file system services 
as the encrypted files should behave normally as of 
the other files within the system. This has been devel-
oped in a customer level space FS for convenience of 
users. All the design goals for the research study have 
been achieved.

ABSTRACT:

In the recent electronic world, we are facing various 
types of dangers to the confidentiality of information. 
The  information  is  saved  on  the  secondary  storage 
devices e. g. hard disks, compact disks, flash drives, 
floppy drives, etc. Some dangers are accidental, such 
as human error, while others are intended. Intended 
dangers are done by the persons for many reasons like 
causing harm, disturbance and other frauds. Among 
these frauds the common one is loss or theft of the 
storage devices. So, the majority of critical topics of 
computer world are security of information. 

It  is  focused  on  preventing  information  from  unau-
thorized access. Due to increase in the dangers to the 
important data which is possessed by the users and 
associations as the data loss results are shown in the 
thesis. There is a need of a robust solution to the dan-
ger  of  information  security.  But  everyone  has  their 
own benefits and limitations. Some are inconvenient 
to the users or others have technical faults. To protect 
and secure the data is very much vital than forever. 
The existing protected file systems are not well used 
by us. Cryptographic is the technique which is used to 
secure the computer systems. 

The encryption is the technique of the cryptography 
which is used and can  gratify the necessary security 
needs of the users for computing machines, internet, 
and the data beside varied dangers set. There are three 
main security assumptions. These are integrity, avail-
ability  and  the  confidentiality.  Our  main  focus  is  on 
improving the two characteristics of security namely 
confidentiality as well as availability, due to the loss of 
the information and the neglecting the services is the 
two biggest one attacks. 

I  INTRODUCTION:

This portion of the thesis will commence the defini-
tions  of  information,  and  information  security.  Also 
we  will  know  about  the  significance  of  information 
security and the penalties of information security, if 
we  will  compromise  it.  The  information  is  collected 
through the Data Loss DB (Open Security Foundation) 
association.

It  is  a  non-profitable  association  of  United  States. 
Data  Loss  DB  (http://datalossdb.org/)  is  a  project  of 
research of United States (but records also losses of 
worldwide data that include the United Kingdom and 
European countries) targeted to inform the events of 
losses of known data and world-wide retrieved. 

These are the society’s attempts to have knowledge 
about the great losses in the society. It is an open call 
to  the  society  by  the  association  that  demands  the 
contributors to contribute in their joint attempt to in-
troduce the novel events of the data losses.

When  information  is  not  protected  appropriate,  it 
may be impaired and is this as an information or secu-
rity breach well known. The penalties of an informa-
tion break are heavy. For commercialization, a breach 
requires usually gigantic financial punishments, luxuri-
ous law processes, loss of the call and business. 

For the personal point, a break to individuality steal-
ing and harm can lead at financial story or credit wor-
thiness. It takes so many years to recover from these 
breaks and is the gigantic costs.

In the starting year of study they were very less only 
10 incidents in the complete year which are to be con-
sidered  by  the  organization.  And  after  that  they  st 
increase till 2008, the year of highest number of inci-
dents takes place. 

There is slight down fall till the year 2010. But again 
they start to increase in the current year 2011. The re-
sults are till the month of September, there may be 
more one till the end of year.

1.2 Steganography:

Steganogrphy  is  another  way  to  protect  the  data 
from the intruders. The information is hided into the 
other images. It covers the vital information very ef-
ficiently that the intruders cannot easily recognize the 
available information. The terminology is taken from 
the  Greek  language.  It  is  the  art  for  communicating 
in which the availability of the communication is com-
pletely hidden. As we compare it with the cryptogra-
phy  where  the  intruders  are  permitted  to  see  or  in-
tercept or detect or modify the communicating data. 
In  the  case  of  this  technique  “Steganography”,  the 
intruders have no knowledge about the presence of 
the information.

Cryptographic goals. These are the basic aims for the 
security providers that are as follows. These are pri-
vacy of data (data confidentiality), integrity of data, 
user authenticity, and non-repudiation. The first three 
are also very well discussed in the first chapter which 
is named as “Introduction”.

 The confidentiality is also called as the privacy of the 
data. The applications which provide the confidential-
ity mean they are keeping the data or information in 
the reach of their permitted users. And keep away the 
unauthorized users. It has another name that is the 
secrecy of data or information. It is provided through 
the use of various methodologies.

 In it the physical security as well as the algorithmic 
conversions  takes  place.  2.  Integrity  of  data  tackles 
the  problems  of  data  alterations  or  data  modifica-
tions. For ensuring the integrity of the data, we must 
spot the manipulations of data done by the intruders. 
Any type of data modification can take place like inser-
tion of new data in between, or deletion of the exact 
data, or substitution of the communicated data.

1.1 Cryptography:

It is the learning of numerical practice narrated to fac-
ets of information protection for example authentica-
tion of entity and data source, confidentialism as well 
as integration of data . It does not merely provide the 
information protection, but it is also a set of mathe-
matical techniques. 

It is the exercise and revision of covering securely to 
the information. Recent cryptography interconnects 
the subjects of mathematical studies, computing tech-
nology, and electrical technology. The cryptographi-
cal  uses  comprise  Automatic  Telling  Machine  cards, 
passwords, and e-commerce. At the very early stage 
it was simply the cipher text that was the nonsense 
data that is not read by the intruders. 

It was only the simple conversion of the data to se-
cure it. As for example it was like, the original word 
“happy”, but after the treatment it was “ibqqz”. Now 
a  reasoning  person  can  easily  understand  the  data 
that it is the single character forward in the English al-
phabet. But some of the year passes it was much com-
plex that it is not possible for the reasoning person 
to understand the information. But the computer age 
grows more the processors with very high speeds. 

They can easily find the converted data to the original 
one.  It  becomes  the  challenge  for  the  cryptologists 
to think about much more accurate and high attach 
bearers algorithms must be developed by the math-
ematicians that the computers cannot resolve them 
easily. There was the use of encryption keys of small 
size but they are also sorted out easily by the intrud-
ers with the help of computers. 

Now there are so many algorithms which require the 
big size keys. At present there are the encryption keys 
of size 128 bytes, 152 bytes, and 256 bytes.

1.3 Electronic Codebook (ECB):
 
In this mode of operation, each block is encrypted in 
the same way. This is the simplest mode of operation 
to  implement,  and  is  easy  to  do  in  parallel  because 
there  are  no  inter-block  dependencies.  The  encryp-
tion simply runs the cipher block algorithm on each 
block  in  the  data;  see  Figure  3.4  for  the  encrypting 
procedure, and the decrypting procedure. 

This means that two identical plain texts will be en-
crypted to identical cipher texts. As mentioned it has 
a severe problem with security. We see in Figure 3.4 
that  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  the  original  picture, 
and this shows that the encryption with ECB in some 
cases is not sufficient. One should however, note that 
even though ECB looks random, it is not a guarantee 
that the encryption is secure.

The  electronic  media  is  controlled  for  the  file  to  be 
stored on it in an efficient way. The media may be of 
any type like floppy disk, compact disk, hard disk, flash 
drives, etc. It has a very clear working at the very first 
look. But it not only stores the data, it also protects 
them from any type of hazards. There are so many file 
systems  which  are  one  the  multiuser  operating  sys-
tems like UNIX operating system. 

In such type of configurations the task becomes more 
typical to handle all the files of many users on a single 
storage space. For a perfect file system it is mandato-
ry to cover the following tasks Totally control the elec-
tronic media which is very novel and it has not been 
maintained previously, The storage is utilized by the 
many processes which are the simultaneous one, In-
trinsic synchronization is needed for all the processes 
on the system, The security and the protection are en-
forced that permits the comfortable data accessing, 
Management of the independent files by many pro-
cess simultaneously, Differentiating of the problems 
within the physical media or rude use of the access-
ing ways by the operating system. It controls the data 
that has been lost because of hardware problems, An 
ordinary collection of the interface functioning must 
be given to the layers which are above of the file sys-
tem in the operating system.  

II  FILE SYSTEM:

It is the way to store and access the stored data in the 
form of files that may be information or executatble 
programs.  This  chapter  covers  the  high-level  details 
of  file  systems  and  the  concerned  matters  like  the 
caches  of  the  storage  devices,  the  interfaces  of  the 
file  systems,  and  the  user-oriented  Application  Pro-
gramming  Interfaces  which  utilizes  the  file  systems 
characteristics. This chapter will highlight the working 
of the file systems. 

It is the main part of the OS. It is used to create, ma-
nipulate, store, and retrieve data. At the highest level, 
a file system is a way to manage information on a sec-
ondary storage medium. There are so many layers un-
der and above the file system. 

All the layers are to be fully described here. This paper 
will give the explanatory knowledge of the file system 
designers and the researchers in the area. Any file sys-
tem is an important component of the operating sys-
tems. It is utilized to handle the storage devices.

There may be many types of categories of the hard 
disk drives. These may be arbitrary accessing, digital 
nature, magnetic nature, and the non-volatile. In nine-
teen hundred and fifty six, the International Business 
Machine launched the hard disks. There are numerous 
names  for  the  hard  disk  drives  like  hard  drive,  hard 
disk, disk drive etc. This device is utilized to store and 
access the digital data or information. It is a perma-
nent storage media. It has one or more numbers of 
the discs which are also known as the platters. These 
platters are furred using the magnetic material.

These have some of the well arranged magnetic heads 
which are used for storing and accessing the data on 
the hard disk drives. Every platter has one or two sur-
faces for storage of the data.  of the basic terminol-
ogy is described here in this section which is used for 
the harddisks. In the Fig. 4.2, the basic components of 
the hard drive are displayed. 

There is more than one platter in the hard drive. One 
or both of the surfaces are furred with the magnetic 
material. This magnetic material is used for the data 
storage. Every surface of the platters has on read and 
write head hovering on it. It is utilized for examining 
or recording of the data. A common axis is used for ro-
tating all the platters. Usually the rotation speed is in 
between fifty four hundreds or seventy two hundreds 
numbers of rotations per minute. 

There are also the higher performance hard disks in 
the market and their costs also increases with better 
speeds. The older versions of the hard disks have the 
less revolution speeds. The movements of the head 
are done along the radius of the platters. It is the com-
bination of the movements done by the rotation head 
and the rotations of the platters. 

There is a communication between the processor and 
the hard disk with the help of the disk controller that 
has been discussed previously. This hides the working 
of the drive from the rest of the applications. While 
the disk controllers for diverse kind of disk drives are 
prepared for the use of the similar interface. The con-
troller is also utilized to work for other kind of jobs.

These are like the caching or removing of the bad sec-
tors.  From  the  above  readings  we  can  easily  know 
the hardware workings. There are more concepts like 
the motor that is used to rotate the platters and the 
movements of the heads backward or forward. The 
electronics  is  used  to  maintain  all  the  operations  of 
the mechanical components. But there is no need to 
know such workings for us of the hard drive.

DiskController:

A storage device is the fundamental part of any com-
puter system. Usually every computer system has the 
following  storage  media  Floppy  disk  drive,Hard  disk 
drive,CD-ROM  disk  drive,DVD  disk  drive  USB  flash 
drive All the devices are interconnected with the com-
puter with the help of the IDE (Integrated Drive Elec-
tronics) interface. . Basically it is the normal path for 
the storage media to interconnect with the computer 
system. This is not the actual interface name as the 
IDE. The unique name for the same interface is the Ad-
vanced Technology Attachment (ATA). 

It  was  developed  for  the  IBM  AT  machine.  Basically 
the disk controller is a circuitry that is enabled with 
the processor for communicating with the all types of 
disks (hard, floppy, DVD, CD, etc.). There are so many 
types of disk controllers available in the market. Some 
of these are like Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE) as 
well as Small computer system interconnects (SCSI). 
The  IDE  controllers  are  utilized  in  the  desktop  com-
puters or personal computers or the standalone com-
puters. Whereas the SCSI is utilized in soaring end per-
sonal computers, workstations for professionals and 
network file servers. All the disk controllers have their 
own individual processors with independent Random 
Access Memory buffers. There is also the availability 
of the Programmable Read Only Memory.

When we use the operating system, we have to se-
cure some important data. The date is always stored 
in the files, so we secure the important files well. To 
check the proposed functionality, we experiment the 
above said system on the Windows operating system. 
With these experiments, we have found that the pro-
posed  system  is  working  properly,  according  to  the 
needs of the users.

The access control is one of the fundamental security 
services  in  the  computer  system.  It  is  a  mechanism 
for  constraining  the  interaction  between  users  and 
protected resources. File is one of the important re-
sources of the computer system. That must be pro-
tected from the unauthorized access that it can’t be 
tempered or stolen by intruders. The file security can 
enforced  using  cryptographic  techniques.  With  the 
help of these techniques the important files are enci-
phered as well as authorization of consumers are pro-
vided suitable encryption keys. 

The cryptographic techniques can be applied at any 
level of the storage systems because they use the lay-
ered architecture. The level may be the block or virtu-
al one in the operating system. Basically, file manage-
ment  is  an  important  task  of  the  computer  system. 
The suggested file security system storing encrypted 
files using Rijndael Algorithm (AES), so an unauthor-
ized user can’t access the important data. 

The encryption takes place for the selected files (im-
portant  ones  which  requires  the  security)  only.  We 
are using the concept of on-demand computing which 
results in the high performance of the computer sys-
tem. The proposed system is working properly for all 
types of the files. In this chapter there are more sec-
tions. Next section is section II which is about the re-
lated works. In section III, the design of the system is 
shown. In section IV, the evaluation is done. In section 
V, there is conclusion.

III USER PROCESS FILE SYSTEM:

The idea of developing a file system as a user process 
is appealing for a variety of reasons not least of which 
being that it is simpler than other techniques. By de-
veloping the file system as a user level process, the 
complexity of kernel level programming can be avoid-
ed.  This  simplifies  the  development  process  enor-
mously, as developing in the kernel is more restrictive 
than user level development. 

The standard development, debugging tools and pro-
gramming libraries can be used. This helps to reduce 
the time required to implement the file system. One 
of  the  most  advantages  of  developing  a  file  system 
as a user level process is that the file system can be 
installed by a user without the assistance of a system 
administrator. This provides the user with greater flex-
ibility in how they use files. Figure 4.4 illustrates how 
a file system developed to run in user space interacts 
with the local and remote operating systems. A user 
process requests access to a file from a user-space file 
system. The request is routed through the kernel. 

STORAGE  ENCRYPTION  AND  JAVA  FILE  SE-
CURITY SYSTEM:

Nowadays,  the  attacks  are  going  to  increase  at  the 
storage  data  systems.  So  the  security  systems  are 
going to turn into a compulsory attribute of any stor-
age  data  system.  For  the  security  purpose  we  are 
always  dependent  on  the  cryptography  techniques. 
These techniques take the performance costs for the 
complete system. So we have proposed the Java File 
Security System(JFSS). It is based on the on-demand 
computing  system  concept,  because  of  the  perfor-
mance issues. It is a greate comback for the system 
performance.

The  concept  is  used  because,  we  are  not  always  in 
need the secure the files, but the selected one only. 
The concerned chapter shows the design of the Java 
File Security System on WindowsXP.

TOWARDS  THE  FILE  SYSTEMS  PERFOR-
MANCE

IV EVALUATION FRAMEWORKS:

This is the era of High Performance Computing (HPC). 
There  is  a  great  demand  of  the  best  performance 
evaluation techniques for the file systems. The task of 
evaluation is both necessary and hard. It gives in depth 
analysis of the target system and that becomes the 
decision points for the users. That is also helpful for 
the inventors or developers to find out the bottleneck 
in  their  systems.  In  this  chapter  many  performance 
evaluation techniques are described for file and stor-
age system evaluation and the main stress is given on 
the important one that is replay traces. 

A survey has been done for the performance evalua-
tion techniques used by the researchers and on the 
replay traces. And the taxonomy of the replay traces 
is  described.  The  some  of  the  popular  replay  traces 
are just like, Tracefs, //Trace, Replayfs and VFS Inter-
ceptor. At last we have concluded all the features that 
must  be  considered  when  we  are  going  to  develop 
the new tool for the replay traces. 

The  complete  work  of  this  chapter  shows  that  the 
storage  system  developers  must  care  about  all  the 
techniques  which  are  utilized  for  the  evaluations  of 
the file storage systems. So they can develop highly 
efficient future file systems. File and storage system 
designs are being proposed in a little span of time be-
cause there is no robust file system is available which 
can perform all the functionalities according to the al-
ways changing user needs. 

Every user has their specific needs or demands which 
are not common at all. One user may ask for the secure 
file system because he/she has important information 
that must be protected from the others which are not 
authorized. Some are demanding for highly portable 
file systems. Considering all these a novel Java File Se-
curity  System  (JFSS)  has  been  developed.  One  user 
demands for the energy efficient file systems because 
he/she is using portable devices.

 Because of such diverse requirements by the users it 
isvery typical to develop a robust file storage system. 
Consequently  a  lot  of  diverse  kinds  of  file  storage 
systems are available. The user has to choose one of 
them which are suitable for them. Here the question 
is which one is better for the selection? To make this 
judgment we require theevaluation tools. These tools 
are to be applied by the researchers on the file sys-
tems under study for the performance evaluation..

VI Conclusion:

Java File Security System (JFSS) offers an answer to 
the file storage system’s main problems like the dif-
ficulty in the portability. This file storage security sys-
tem is designed for single operating system as well as 
grouped in the previously loaded Virtual Machine. The 
users can execute the JFSS on any operating system. 
It can be utilized as a file storage system. We have pre-
sented a JFSS design with minimal performance over-
heads because of ondemand computing and notice-
able semantic alterations for users. 

File storage system semantics are preserved exclusive 
of file system alterations, therefore supports the exist-
ing file storage systems performances. We have con-
tributed in designing and enlargement of a user space 
cryptographic file storage system. We have balanced 
the  design  goals  like  security,  performance,  conve-
nient  and  independability  of  the  system.  We  have 
achieved the high security by including the support of 
the Rijndeal Algorithm (AES) and we have saved the 
keys on the portable smart cards for the documents 
which are important. 

The performance is achieved with the help of on-de-
mand computing concept which is that we are not go-
ing to encrypt all the files on the computer system, 
but we are going to encrypt only the important docu-
ments only. It saves the performance overhead of the 
system. The system is very convenient to the users. 
And the independability is attained by the novel Java 
technology which is highly portable. So the complete 
system is a highly independent of the configuration. 
At the end of thesis, I would like to conclude that my 
design goals in the research have been achieved well. 

The proposed system has better system performance 
as well as expands it for the existing file system. It is 
an independent File System (it does not require the 
modifications in the other file systems or user appli-
cations). It offers strong storage protection alongside 
of the very unimportant and reasonable attacks. It is 
compatible  with  the  future  technology  for  separate 
key management just like smart cards for storing the 
encryption keys which are directly in the possession 
of authorized users. 

It is compatible with the existing file system services 
as the encrypted files should behave normally as of 
the other files within the system. This has been devel-
oped in a customer level space FS for convenience of 
users. All the design goals for the research study have 
been achieved.
