The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies.

C.  Traditional techniques 
 
i.  Geometric approach 

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and 
areas  of  some  figures  formed  by  the  points.  The  featured  set  is  studied  to  compare  the  recognition  result.  Distances  in  the

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4]. 
 

III. HARDWARE 

 

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring 
system sends a signal to the security system. Then security system initiate the web cam, webcam captures the image of the 
driver,  using  Principle  Component  Analysis  technique  compare  the  captured  image  with  data  bas  stored  images,  if  image 
matches  with  those  data  base  images  security  part  ignite  the  engine,  if  not  security  part  sends  that  captured  image  to  the 
owner Email id and it will also send the location information    
 
A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

I. INTRODUCTION 

A.  Control Area Network  
 

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple 
implementation  and  small  overhead.  CAN  is  a  serial  bus  communications  protocol  developed  by  Bosch  [3]  (an  electrical 
equipment manufacturer in Germany) in the  early 1980s. Thereafter, CAN was standardized as ISO-11898 and ISO-11519, 
establishing  itself  as  the  standard protocol  for  in  vehicle  networking  in  the  auto  industry.  By  networking  the  electronics  in 
vehicles with CAN, however, they could be controlled from a central point, the Engine Control Unit (ECU), thus increasing 
functionality,  adding  modularity,  and  making  diagnostic  processes  more  efficient.  CAN  offer  an  efficient  communication 
protocol  between  sensors,  actuators,  controllers,  and  other  nodes  in  real-time  applications,  and  is  known  for  its  simplicity, 
reliability, and high performance [1].

B.  Biometrics  
 

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

II. RELATED WORK  

 Douglas W. Gage (1995) discusses the history of developments made in control of unmanned ground vehicles. The 
basic  idea  of  a  digital  driving  system  and  how  to  formulate  digital  driving  system  architecture  have  been  discussed  by 
Wuhong Wang (2002), C. Little (1999), Gerd Krämer (2001), Fei-Yue Wang et al (2002), Julian Kolodko et al (2003). Luis 
Manuel  et  al  (2002)  and  Richard  Bishop  (2000)  have  dealt  with  the  various  features  that  can  be  included  to  improve  the 
driving experience in a digital driving system. Tatsuya Yoshida et al (2004) discuss the concept of adaptive driving systems. 
U. Franke et al (1999) discusses various approaches to develop autonomous vehicles. The issues in developing a CAN based 
embedded network system have been dealt by Robert Boys (2004), Steve Corrigan (2002) and John Rinaldi et al (2003). The 
website  of  Microchip  Inc.  USA  gives  information  about  how  to  develop  a  CAN  system  using  their  microcontroller  PIC 
18F4685. The website of CAN in Automation (CiA) provides information about the basics of CAN protocol. 
 
B.  Face Recognition 
 
                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies. 
 
C.  Traditional techniques 
 
i.  Geometric approach 

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and 
areas  of  some  figures  formed  by  the  points.  The  featured  set  is  studied  to  compare  the  recognition  result.  Distances  in  the 
feature  space  from  a  template  image  to  every  image  in  the  database  were  calculated.  Following  to  the  FERET  protocol,  5

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4]. 
 

III. HARDWARE 

 

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring 
system sends a signal to the security system. Then security system initiate the web cam, webcam captures the image of the 
driver,  using  Principle  Component  Analysis  technique  compare  the  captured  image  with  data  bas  stored  images,  if  image 
matches  with  those  data  base  images  security  part  ignite  the  engine,  if  not  security  part  sends  that  captured  image  to  the 
owner Email id and it will also send the location information    
 
A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always 
requires a metal target. 
 
D.  Load Sensor 
        A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens 
in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures 
the  deformation  (strain)  as  an  electrical  signal,  because  the  strain  changes  the  effective  electrical  resistance  of  the  wire.  A 
load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4].

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring

A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always 
requires a metal target. 
 
D.  Load Sensor 
        A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens 
in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures 
the  deformation  (strain)  as  an  electrical  signal,  because  the  strain  changes  the  effective  electrical  resistance  of  the  wire.  A 
load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

the  help  of  mat  lab  code  initializing  the  webcam  of  a  laptop,  capturing  the  image  and  comparing  it  with  the  database  of 
images (training images) present in the laptop. 
        Perform face recognition, the similarity score is calculated between an input face image and each of the training images. 
The matched face is the one with the highest similarity, and the magnitude of the similarity score indicates the confidence of 
the match (with a unit value indicating an exact match). There are various steps in performing this face recognition, we will 
be discussing step by step, however before that we will be discussing about Eigen faces used in this paper.  
 
 
A. 
       The steps involve in initialization process are 

The Eigen faces approach for face recognition involves the following two operations: 

Initialization process 

  Acquire a set of training images. 
  Calculate  the  Eigen  faces  from  the  training  set,  keeping  only  the  best  M  images  with  the  highest  Eigen  values. 

 

These M images define the “face space”. As new faces are experienced, the Eigen faces can be updated. 
·Calculate  the  corresponding  distribution  in  M-dimensional  weight  space  for  each  known  individual  (training 
image), by projecting their face images onto the face. 

 
B.  Recognition process 
 
        Having initialized the system, next process involves is recognition process and the steps involves in this process are, 

  Given an image to be recognized, calculate a set of weights of the M Eigen faces by projecting the it onto each of 

the Eigen faces. 

  Determine if the image is a face at all by checking to see if the image is sufficiently close to the face space. 
 
 
 

If it is a face, classify the weight pattern as either a known person or as unknown. 
(Optional) Update the Eigen faces and/or weight patterns. 
(Optional) Calculate the characteristic weight pattern of the new face image, and incorporate into the known faces. 

 

V. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

A.  Acquire a set of training images 
 
Training set of m images of size N x N are represented by vectors of size N2. Each face is represented by Г1, Г2, Г3… ГM 
 
.Feature vector of a face is stored in a N x N matrix. Now, this two dimensional vector is changed to one dimensional vector. 
For example, 

     
[
     

] = Гi  =   [

  
  
  
  

] 

Each face image is represented by the vector Гi.   

B.  Mean and Mean Centred Images 
 
 

Average face image is calculated by, 

 

Ψ = (1/M) ∑   

    i                                                  

Ψ = ( 1 +  1+  1+ ………. +  M) / M. 

 

Each face differs from the average by Φi = Гi - Ψ which is called mean cantered image. 
 
 C.  Covariance Matrix 
 
A covariance matrix is constructed as C = A AT, where A = [Φ1, Φ1, Φ2 …. ΦM ]  of size N2x N2.Size of covariance matrix 
 
will be N2 x N2. Eigen vectors corresponding to this covariance matrix is needed to be calculated, but that will be a tedious 
task therefore, calculate ATA Size of this matrix M x M. Then calculate the Eigen vector and Eigen value of the covariance 
matrix of size M x M. 
Consider the eigenvectors vi of AT A such that, 

ATA Xi = λi Xi

Abstract  —  Controller  Area  Network  (CAN)  is  a  network  protocol  that  allows  multiple  processors  in  a  system  to 
communicate  efficiently  with  each  other.    Based  on  requirements  of  modern  vehicles,  in  vehicle  Control  Area  Network 
(CAN) architecture has been implemented. In order to reduce point to point wiring harness in vehicle automation, CAN is 
suggested  as  a  means  for  data  communication  within  the  environment.  The  benefits  of  CAN  bus  based  network  over 
traditional point schemes will offer increased flexibility and expandability for future technology insertions. This project is 
aimed  at  the  implementation  of  CAN  protocol  using  PIC  for  vehicle  monitoring  system  and  security  using  Principle

system  automatically  takes  photos  of  driver  and  compares  his  or  her  face  with  database  to  check  whether  he  is  an 
authenticated  driver  or  not.  He  can  have  access  to  the  vehicle  only  if  he  is  an  authenticated  driver.  If  he  is  not  an

I. INTRODUCTION 

A.  Control Area Network  
 

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple 
implementation  and  small  overhead.  CAN  is  a  serial  bus  communications  protocol  developed  by  Bosch  [3]  (an  electrical 
equipment manufacturer in Germany) in the  early 1980s. Thereafter, CAN was standardized as ISO-11898 and ISO-11519, 
establishing  itself  as  the  standard protocol  for  in  vehicle  networking  in  the  auto  industry.  By  networking  the  electronics  in 
vehicles with CAN, however, they could be controlled from a central point, the Engine Control Unit (ECU), thus increasing 
functionality,  adding  modularity,  and  making  diagnostic  processes  more  efficient.  CAN  offer  an  efficient  communication 
protocol  between  sensors,  actuators,  controllers,  and  other  nodes  in  real-time  applications,  and  is  known  for  its  simplicity, 
reliability, and high performance [1].

B.  Biometrics  
 

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

II. RELATED WORK  

 Douglas W. Gage (1995) discusses the history of developments made in control of unmanned ground vehicles. The 
basic  idea  of  a  digital  driving  system  and  how  to  formulate  digital  driving  system  architecture  have  been  discussed  by 
Wuhong Wang (2002), C. Little (1999), Gerd Krämer (2001), Fei-Yue Wang et al (2002), Julian Kolodko et al (2003). Luis 
Manuel  et  al  (2002)  and  Richard  Bishop  (2000)  have  dealt  with  the  various  features  that  can  be  included  to  improve  the 
driving experience in a digital driving system. Tatsuya Yoshida et al (2004) discuss the concept of adaptive driving systems. 
U. Franke et al (1999) discusses various approaches to develop autonomous vehicles. The issues in developing a CAN based 
embedded network system have been dealt by Robert Boys (2004), Steve Corrigan (2002) and John Rinaldi et al (2003). The 
website  of  Microchip  Inc.  USA  gives  information  about  how  to  develop  a  CAN  system  using  their  microcontroller  PIC 
18F4685. The website of CAN in Automation (CiA) provides information about the basics of CAN protocol. 
 
B.  Face Recognition 
 
                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies.

load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

the  help  of  mat  lab  code  initializing  the  webcam  of  a  laptop,  capturing  the  image  and  comparing  it  with  the  database  of 
images (training images) present in the laptop. 
        Perform face recognition, the similarity score is calculated between an input face image and each of the training images. 
The matched face is the one with the highest similarity, and the magnitude of the similarity score indicates the confidence of 
the match (with a unit value indicating an exact match). There are various steps in performing this face recognition, we will 
be discussing step by step, however before that we will be discussing about Eigen faces used in this paper.  
 
 
A. 
       The steps involve in initialization process are 

The Eigen faces approach for face recognition involves the following two operations: 

Initialization process 

  Acquire a set of training images. 
  Calculate  the  Eigen  faces  from  the  training  set,  keeping  only  the  best  M  images  with  the  highest  Eigen  values. 

 

These M images define the “face space”. As new faces are experienced, the Eigen faces can be updated. 
·Calculate  the  corresponding  distribution  in  M-dimensional  weight  space  for  each  known  individual  (training 
image), by projecting their face images onto the face. 

 
B.  Recognition process 
 
        Having initialized the system, next process involves is recognition process and the steps involves in this process are, 

  Given an image to be recognized, calculate a set of weights of the M Eigen faces by projecting the it onto each of 

the Eigen faces. 

  Determine if the image is a face at all by checking to see if the image is sufficiently close to the face space. 
 
 
 

If it is a face, classify the weight pattern as either a known person or as unknown. 
(Optional) Update the Eigen faces and/or weight patterns. 
(Optional) Calculate the characteristic weight pattern of the new face image, and incorporate into the known faces. 

 

V. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

A.  Acquire a set of training images 
 
Training set of m images of size N x N are represented by vectors of size N2. Each face is represented by Г1, Г2, Г3… ГM 
 
.Feature vector of a face is stored in a N x N matrix. Now, this two dimensional vector is changed to one dimensional vector. 
For example, 

     
[
     

] = Гi  =   [

  
  
  
  

] 

Each face image is represented by the vector Гi.   

B.  Mean and Mean Centred Images 
 
 

Average face image is calculated by, 

 

Ψ = (1/M) ∑   

    i                                                  

Ψ = ( 1 +  1+  1+ ………. +  M) / M. 

 

Each face differs from the average by Φi = Гi - Ψ which is called mean cantered image. 
 
 C.  Covariance Matrix 
 
A covariance matrix is constructed as C = A AT, where A = [Φ1, Φ1, Φ2 …. ΦM ]  of size N2x N2.Size of covariance matrix 
 
will be N2 x N2. Eigen vectors corresponding to this covariance matrix is needed to be calculated, but that will be a tedious 
task therefore, calculate ATA Size of this matrix M x M. Then calculate the Eigen vector and Eigen value of the covariance 
matrix of size M x M. 
Consider the eigenvectors vi of AT A such that, 

ATA Xi = λi Xi 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                      38 
 

Lingaraju M R et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 34-42 

Now multiplying the above equation with A both sides we get,  

AAT (AXi) = λi(AXi) 

D.  Eigen Face Space 
 
 
The Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix AAT are AXi which is denoted by Ui. Ui resembles facial images which look 
ghostly and are called Eigen faces. Eigen vectors correspond to each Eigen face in the face space and discard the faces for 
which Eigen values are zero thus reducing the Eigen face space to an extent. The Eigen faces are ranked according to their 
usefulness in characterizing the variation among the images. 
A face image can be projected into this face space by, 
 

k = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

k = 1,  .... , M, where (Гk -  Ψ) is the mean centered image. 
Hence projection of each image can be obtained as Ω1 for projection of image Ω1 and Ω2 for projection of image Ω2 and 
hence forth. 
 
E.  Recognition Step 
 
 

The test image, Г, is projected into the face space to obtain a vector, Ω as  

Ω = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

The distance of Ω to each face is called Euclidean distance and defined by 

k = ||Ω – Ωk ||2 
Where k = 1, … ,M   where Ωk is a vector describing the kth face class. 
A face is classified as belonging to class k when the minimum €k is below some Chosen threshold θc . otherwise the face is 
classified as unknown. θc, is half the largest distance between any two face images: 
 

€2

where  j, k = 1, …… , M  
 Find the distance € between the original test image Г and its re-constructed image from the Eigen face Гf  
 

θc = (1/2)max j,k ||Ωj – Ωk || 

€2 = || Г - Гf ||2 

Where Гf  = U * Ω + Ψ. 
 
If € >= θc then input image is not even a face image and not recognized. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input image is a face image but it is recognized as unknown face. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input images are the individual face image associated with the class vector Ω k[5]. 
 
 
 

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

        This thesis is concerned  about implementation of CAN nodes for  monitoring parameters and security  for car systems. 
The  monitoring  parameters  are  temperature,  battery  voltage,  light  due  to  spark  or  fire  and  CO  level  in  the  exhaust.  For 
monitoring the above parameters, LM35 sensor, LDR and MQ6 sensors are used. For implementing this, the programming of 
LED,  ADC  and  LCD  interfacing  with  microcontroller  is  done  using  Embedded  C.  In  this  project,  the  real  time  face 
recognition  is  achieved  using  PCA  algorithm.    An  embedded  automotive  security  system  is  presented  in  this  paper.  Face 
recognition  is  a  both  challenging  and  important  recognition  technique.  It  has  been  shown  that  a  proposed  system  can  be 
implemented at any types of automobiles and can be used at any place where face recognition is needed. This system reduces 
increased  amount  of  vehicle  theft  present  today.  Comparing  with  traditional  automotive  system,  this  system  does  not  need 
any sensor, and thus it is highly reliable.

Abstract  —  Controller  Area  Network  (CAN)  is  a  network  protocol  that  allows  multiple  processors  in  a  system  to 
communicate  efficiently  with  each  other.    Based  on  requirements  of  modern  vehicles,  in  vehicle  Control  Area  Network 
(CAN) architecture has been implemented. In order to reduce point to point wiring harness in vehicle automation, CAN is 
suggested  as  a  means  for  data  communication  within  the  environment.  The  benefits  of  CAN  bus  based  network  over 
traditional point schemes will offer increased flexibility and expandability for future technology insertions. This project is 
aimed  at  the  implementation  of  CAN  protocol  using  PIC  for  vehicle  monitoring  system  and  security  using  Principle 
component  analysis.  The  main  feature  of  the  system  includes  monitoring  of  various  vehicles.  In  the  security  part,  The 
system  automatically  takes  photos  of  driver  and  compares  his  or  her  face  with  database  to  check  whether  he  is  an 
authenticated  driver  or  not.  He  can  have  access  to  the  vehicle  only  if  he  is  an  authenticated  driver.  If  he  is  not  an

I. INTRODUCTION 

A.  Control Area Network  
 

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple 
implementation  and  small  overhead.  CAN  is  a  serial  bus  communications  protocol  developed  by  Bosch  [3]  (an  electrical 
equipment manufacturer in Germany) in the  early 1980s. Thereafter, CAN was standardized as ISO-11898 and ISO-11519, 
establishing  itself  as  the  standard protocol  for  in  vehicle  networking  in  the  auto  industry.  By  networking  the  electronics  in 
vehicles with CAN, however, they could be controlled from a central point, the Engine Control Unit (ECU), thus increasing 
functionality,  adding  modularity,  and  making  diagnostic  processes  more  efficient.  CAN  offer  an  efficient  communication 
protocol  between  sensors,  actuators,  controllers,  and  other  nodes  in  real-time  applications,  and  is  known  for  its  simplicity, 
reliability, and high performance [1].

B.  Biometrics  
 

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

II. RELATED WORK  

 Douglas W. Gage (1995) discusses the history of developments made in control of unmanned ground vehicles. The 
basic  idea  of  a  digital  driving  system  and  how  to  formulate  digital  driving  system  architecture  have  been  discussed  by 
Wuhong Wang (2002), C. Little (1999), Gerd Krämer (2001), Fei-Yue Wang et al (2002), Julian Kolodko et al (2003). Luis 
Manuel  et  al  (2002)  and  Richard  Bishop  (2000)  have  dealt  with  the  various  features  that  can  be  included  to  improve  the 
driving experience in a digital driving system. Tatsuya Yoshida et al (2004) discuss the concept of adaptive driving systems. 
U. Franke et al (1999) discusses various approaches to develop autonomous vehicles. The issues in developing a CAN based 
embedded network system have been dealt by Robert Boys (2004), Steve Corrigan (2002) and John Rinaldi et al (2003). The 
website  of  Microchip  Inc.  USA  gives  information  about  how  to  develop  a  CAN  system  using  their  microcontroller  PIC 
18F4685. The website of CAN in Automation (CiA) provides information about the basics of CAN protocol. 
 
B.  Face Recognition 
 
                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies. 
 
C.  Traditional techniques 
 
i.  Geometric approach 

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and 
areas  of  some  figures  formed  by  the  points.  The  featured  set  is  studied  to  compare  the  recognition  result.  Distances  in  the 
feature  space  from  a  template  image  to  every  image  in  the  database  were  calculated.  Following  to  the  FERET  protocol,  5

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4]. 
 

III. HARDWARE 

 

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring 
system sends a signal to the security system. Then security system initiate the web cam, webcam captures the image of the 
driver,  using  Principle  Component  Analysis  technique  compare  the  captured  image  with  data  bas  stored  images,  if  image 
matches  with  those  data  base  images  security  part  ignite  the  engine,  if  not  security  part  sends  that  captured  image  to  the 
owner Email id and it will also send the location information    
 
A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always 
requires a metal target. 
 
D.  Load Sensor 
        A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens 
in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures 
the  deformation  (strain)  as  an  electrical  signal,  because  the  strain  changes  the  effective  electrical  resistance  of  the  wire.  A 
load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

the  help  of  mat  lab  code  initializing  the  webcam  of  a  laptop,  capturing  the  image  and  comparing  it  with  the  database  of 
images (training images) present in the laptop. 
        Perform face recognition, the similarity score is calculated between an input face image and each of the training images. 
The matched face is the one with the highest similarity, and the magnitude of the similarity score indicates the confidence of 
the match (with a unit value indicating an exact match). There are various steps in performing this face recognition, we will 
be discussing step by step, however before that we will be discussing about Eigen faces used in this paper.  
 
 
A. 
       The steps involve in initialization process are 

The Eigen faces approach for face recognition involves the following two operations: 

Initialization process 

  Acquire a set of training images. 
  Calculate  the  Eigen  faces  from  the  training  set,  keeping  only  the  best  M  images  with  the  highest  Eigen  values. 

 

These M images define the “face space”. As new faces are experienced, the Eigen faces can be updated. 
·Calculate  the  corresponding  distribution  in  M-dimensional  weight  space  for  each  known  individual  (training 
image), by projecting their face images onto the face. 

 
B.  Recognition process 
 
        Having initialized the system, next process involves is recognition process and the steps involves in this process are, 

  Given an image to be recognized, calculate a set of weights of the M Eigen faces by projecting the it onto each of 

the Eigen faces. 

  Determine if the image is a face at all by checking to see if the image is sufficiently close to the face space. 
 
 
 

If it is a face, classify the weight pattern as either a known person or as unknown. 
(Optional) Update the Eigen faces and/or weight patterns. 
(Optional) Calculate the characteristic weight pattern of the new face image, and incorporate into the known faces. 

 

V. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

A.  Acquire a set of training images 
 
Training set of m images of size N x N are represented by vectors of size N2. Each face is represented by Г1, Г2, Г3… ГM 
 
.Feature vector of a face is stored in a N x N matrix. Now, this two dimensional vector is changed to one dimensional vector. 
For example, 

     
[
     

] = Гi  =   [

  
  
  
  

] 

Each face image is represented by the vector Гi.   

B.  Mean and Mean Centred Images 
 
 

Average face image is calculated by, 

 

Ψ = (1/M) ∑   

    i                                                  

Ψ = ( 1 +  1+  1+ ………. +  M) / M. 

 

Each face differs from the average by Φi = Гi - Ψ which is called mean cantered image. 
 
 C.  Covariance Matrix 
 
A covariance matrix is constructed as C = A AT, where A = [Φ1, Φ1, Φ2 …. ΦM ]  of size N2x N2.Size of covariance matrix 
 
will be N2 x N2. Eigen vectors corresponding to this covariance matrix is needed to be calculated, but that will be a tedious 
task therefore, calculate ATA Size of this matrix M x M. Then calculate the Eigen vector and Eigen value of the covariance 
matrix of size M x M. 
Consider the eigenvectors vi of AT A such that, 

ATA Xi = λi Xi

Lingaraju M R et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 34-42 

Now multiplying the above equation with A both sides we get,  

AAT (AXi) = λi(AXi) 

D.  Eigen Face Space 
 
 
The Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix AAT are AXi which is denoted by Ui. Ui resembles facial images which look 
ghostly and are called Eigen faces. Eigen vectors correspond to each Eigen face in the face space and discard the faces for 
which Eigen values are zero thus reducing the Eigen face space to an extent. The Eigen faces are ranked according to their 
usefulness in characterizing the variation among the images. 
A face image can be projected into this face space by, 
 

k = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

k = 1,  .... , M, where (Гk -  Ψ) is the mean centered image. 
Hence projection of each image can be obtained as Ω1 for projection of image Ω1 and Ω2 for projection of image Ω2 and 
hence forth. 
 
E.  Recognition Step 
 
 

The test image, Г, is projected into the face space to obtain a vector, Ω as  

Ω = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

The distance of Ω to each face is called Euclidean distance and defined by 

k = ||Ω – Ωk ||2 
Where k = 1, … ,M   where Ωk is a vector describing the kth face class. 
A face is classified as belonging to class k when the minimum €k is below some Chosen threshold θc . otherwise the face is 
classified as unknown. θc, is half the largest distance between any two face images: 
 

€2

where  j, k = 1, …… , M  
 Find the distance € between the original test image Г and its re-constructed image from the Eigen face Гf  
 

θc = (1/2)max j,k ||Ωj – Ωk || 

€2 = || Г - Гf ||2 

Where Гf  = U * Ω + Ψ. 
 
If € >= θc then input image is not even a face image and not recognized. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input image is a face image but it is recognized as unknown face. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input images are the individual face image associated with the class vector Ω k[5]. 
 
 
 

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

        This thesis is concerned  about implementation of CAN nodes for  monitoring parameters and security  for car systems. 
The  monitoring  parameters  are  temperature,  battery  voltage,  light  due  to  spark  or  fire  and  CO  level  in  the  exhaust.  For 
monitoring the above parameters, LM35 sensor, LDR and MQ6 sensors are used. For implementing this, the programming of 
LED,  ADC  and  LCD  interfacing  with  microcontroller  is  done  using  Embedded  C.  In  this  project,  the  real  time  face 
recognition  is  achieved  using  PCA  algorithm.    An  embedded  automotive  security  system  is  presented  in  this  paper.  Face 
recognition  is  a  both  challenging  and  important  recognition  technique.  It  has  been  shown  that  a  proposed  system  can  be 
implemented at any types of automobiles and can be used at any place where face recognition is needed. This system reduces 
increased  amount  of  vehicle  theft  present  today.  Comparing  with  traditional  automotive  system,  this  system  does  not  need 
any sensor, and thus it is highly reliable.

Abstract  —  Controller  Area  Network  (CAN)  is  a  network  protocol  that  allows  multiple  processors  in  a  system  to 
communicate  efficiently  with  each  other.    Based  on  requirements  of  modern  vehicles,  in  vehicle  Control  Area  Network 
(CAN) architecture has been implemented. In order to reduce point to point wiring harness in vehicle automation, CAN is 
suggested  as  a  means  for  data  communication  within  the  environment.  The  benefits  of  CAN  bus  based  network  over 
traditional point schemes will offer increased flexibility and expandability for future technology insertions. This project is 
aimed  at  the  implementation  of  CAN  protocol  using  PIC  for  vehicle  monitoring  system  and  security  using  Principle 
component  analysis.  The  main  feature  of  the  system  includes  monitoring  of  various  vehicles.  In  the  security  part,  The 
system  automatically  takes  photos  of  driver  and  compares  his  or  her  face  with  database  to  check  whether  he  is  an 
authenticated  driver  or  not.  He  can  have  access  to  the  vehicle  only  if  he  is  an  authenticated  driver.  If  he  is  not  an 
authenticated driver access to the vehicle will not be provided. Also, the owner of the vehicle gets an image of the theft via

I. INTRODUCTION 

A.  Control Area Network  
 

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple 
implementation  and  small  overhead.  CAN  is  a  serial  bus  communications  protocol  developed  by  Bosch  [3]  (an  electrical 
equipment manufacturer in Germany) in the  early 1980s. Thereafter, CAN was standardized as ISO-11898 and ISO-11519, 
establishing  itself  as  the  standard protocol  for  in  vehicle  networking  in  the  auto  industry.  By  networking  the  electronics  in 
vehicles with CAN, however, they could be controlled from a central point, the Engine Control Unit (ECU), thus increasing 
functionality,  adding  modularity,  and  making  diagnostic  processes  more  efficient.  CAN  offer  an  efficient  communication 
protocol  between  sensors,  actuators,  controllers,  and  other  nodes  in  real-time  applications,  and  is  known  for  its  simplicity, 
reliability, and high performance [1].

B.  Biometrics  
 

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

II. RELATED WORK  

 Douglas W. Gage (1995) discusses the history of developments made in control of unmanned ground vehicles. The 
basic  idea  of  a  digital  driving  system  and  how  to  formulate  digital  driving  system  architecture  have  been  discussed  by 
Wuhong Wang (2002), C. Little (1999), Gerd Krämer (2001), Fei-Yue Wang et al (2002), Julian Kolodko et al (2003). Luis 
Manuel  et  al  (2002)  and  Richard  Bishop  (2000)  have  dealt  with  the  various  features  that  can  be  included  to  improve  the 
driving experience in a digital driving system. Tatsuya Yoshida et al (2004) discuss the concept of adaptive driving systems. 
U. Franke et al (1999) discusses various approaches to develop autonomous vehicles. The issues in developing a CAN based 
embedded network system have been dealt by Robert Boys (2004), Steve Corrigan (2002) and John Rinaldi et al (2003). The 
website  of  Microchip  Inc.  USA  gives  information  about  how  to  develop  a  CAN  system  using  their  microcontroller  PIC 
18F4685. The website of CAN in Automation (CiA) provides information about the basics of CAN protocol. 
 
B.  Face Recognition 
 
                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies. 
 
C.  Traditional techniques 
 
i.  Geometric approach 

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and 
areas  of  some  figures  formed  by  the  points.  The  featured  set  is  studied  to  compare  the  recognition  result.  Distances  in  the 
feature  space  from  a  template  image  to  every  image  in  the  database  were  calculated.  Following  to  the  FERET  protocol,  5

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4]. 
 

III. HARDWARE 

 

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring 
system sends a signal to the security system. Then security system initiate the web cam, webcam captures the image of the 
driver,  using  Principle  Component  Analysis  technique  compare  the  captured  image  with  data  bas  stored  images,  if  image 
matches  with  those  data  base  images  security  part  ignite  the  engine,  if  not  security  part  sends  that  captured  image  to  the 
owner Email id and it will also send the location information    
 
A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always 
requires a metal target. 
 
D.  Load Sensor 
        A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens 
in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures 
the  deformation  (strain)  as  an  electrical  signal,  because  the  strain  changes  the  effective  electrical  resistance  of  the  wire.  A 
load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

the  help  of  mat  lab  code  initializing  the  webcam  of  a  laptop,  capturing  the  image  and  comparing  it  with  the  database  of 
images (training images) present in the laptop. 
        Perform face recognition, the similarity score is calculated between an input face image and each of the training images. 
The matched face is the one with the highest similarity, and the magnitude of the similarity score indicates the confidence of 
the match (with a unit value indicating an exact match). There are various steps in performing this face recognition, we will 
be discussing step by step, however before that we will be discussing about Eigen faces used in this paper.  
 
 
A. 
       The steps involve in initialization process are 

The Eigen faces approach for face recognition involves the following two operations: 

Initialization process 

  Acquire a set of training images. 
  Calculate  the  Eigen  faces  from  the  training  set,  keeping  only  the  best  M  images  with  the  highest  Eigen  values. 

 

These M images define the “face space”. As new faces are experienced, the Eigen faces can be updated. 
·Calculate  the  corresponding  distribution  in  M-dimensional  weight  space  for  each  known  individual  (training 
image), by projecting their face images onto the face. 

 
B.  Recognition process 
 
        Having initialized the system, next process involves is recognition process and the steps involves in this process are, 

  Given an image to be recognized, calculate a set of weights of the M Eigen faces by projecting the it onto each of 

the Eigen faces. 

  Determine if the image is a face at all by checking to see if the image is sufficiently close to the face space. 
 
 
 

If it is a face, classify the weight pattern as either a known person or as unknown. 
(Optional) Update the Eigen faces and/or weight patterns. 
(Optional) Calculate the characteristic weight pattern of the new face image, and incorporate into the known faces. 

 

V. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

A.  Acquire a set of training images 
 
Training set of m images of size N x N are represented by vectors of size N2. Each face is represented by Г1, Г2, Г3… ГM 
 
.Feature vector of a face is stored in a N x N matrix. Now, this two dimensional vector is changed to one dimensional vector. 
For example, 

     
[
     

] = Гi  =   [

  
  
  
  

] 

Each face image is represented by the vector Гi.   

B.  Mean and Mean Centred Images 
 
 

Average face image is calculated by, 

 

Ψ = (1/M) ∑   

    i                                                  

Ψ = ( 1 +  1+  1+ ………. +  M) / M. 

 

Each face differs from the average by Φi = Гi - Ψ which is called mean cantered image. 
 
 C.  Covariance Matrix 
 
A covariance matrix is constructed as C = A AT, where A = [Φ1, Φ1, Φ2 …. ΦM ]  of size N2x N2.Size of covariance matrix 
 
will be N2 x N2. Eigen vectors corresponding to this covariance matrix is needed to be calculated, but that will be a tedious 
task therefore, calculate ATA Size of this matrix M x M. Then calculate the Eigen vector and Eigen value of the covariance 
matrix of size M x M. 
Consider the eigenvectors vi of AT A such that, 

ATA Xi = λi Xi

Lingaraju M R et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 34-42 

Now multiplying the above equation with A both sides we get,  

AAT (AXi) = λi(AXi) 

D.  Eigen Face Space 
 
 
The Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix AAT are AXi which is denoted by Ui. Ui resembles facial images which look 
ghostly and are called Eigen faces. Eigen vectors correspond to each Eigen face in the face space and discard the faces for 
which Eigen values are zero thus reducing the Eigen face space to an extent. The Eigen faces are ranked according to their 
usefulness in characterizing the variation among the images. 
A face image can be projected into this face space by, 
 

k = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

k = 1,  .... , M, where (Гk -  Ψ) is the mean centered image. 
Hence projection of each image can be obtained as Ω1 for projection of image Ω1 and Ω2 for projection of image Ω2 and 
hence forth. 
 
E.  Recognition Step 
 
 

The test image, Г, is projected into the face space to obtain a vector, Ω as  

Ω = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

The distance of Ω to each face is called Euclidean distance and defined by 

k = ||Ω – Ωk ||2 
Where k = 1, … ,M   where Ωk is a vector describing the kth face class. 
A face is classified as belonging to class k when the minimum €k is below some Chosen threshold θc . otherwise the face is 
classified as unknown. θc, is half the largest distance between any two face images: 
 

€2

where  j, k = 1, …… , M  
 Find the distance € between the original test image Г and its re-constructed image from the Eigen face Гf  
 

θc = (1/2)max j,k ||Ωj – Ωk || 

€2 = || Г - Гf ||2 

Where Гf  = U * Ω + Ψ. 
 
If € >= θc then input image is not even a face image and not recognized. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input image is a face image but it is recognized as unknown face. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input images are the individual face image associated with the class vector Ω k[5]. 
 
 
 

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

        This thesis is concerned  about implementation of CAN nodes for  monitoring parameters and security  for car systems. 
The  monitoring  parameters  are  temperature,  battery  voltage,  light  due  to  spark  or  fire  and  CO  level  in  the  exhaust.  For 
monitoring the above parameters, LM35 sensor, LDR and MQ6 sensors are used. For implementing this, the programming of 
LED,  ADC  and  LCD  interfacing  with  microcontroller  is  done  using  Embedded  C.  In  this  project,  the  real  time  face 
recognition  is  achieved  using  PCA  algorithm.    An  embedded  automotive  security  system  is  presented  in  this  paper.  Face 
recognition  is  a  both  challenging  and  important  recognition  technique.  It  has  been  shown  that  a  proposed  system  can  be 
implemented at any types of automobiles and can be used at any place where face recognition is needed. This system reduces 
increased  amount  of  vehicle  theft  present  today.  Comparing  with  traditional  automotive  system,  this  system  does  not  need 
any sensor, and thus it is highly reliable.

Abstract  —  Controller  Area  Network  (CAN)  is  a  network  protocol  that  allows  multiple  processors  in  a  system  to 
communicate  efficiently  with  each  other.    Based  on  requirements  of  modern  vehicles,  in  vehicle  Control  Area  Network 
(CAN) architecture has been implemented. In order to reduce point to point wiring harness in vehicle automation, CAN is 
suggested  as  a  means  for  data  communication  within  the  environment.  The  benefits  of  CAN  bus  based  network  over 
traditional point schemes will offer increased flexibility and expandability for future technology insertions. This project is 
aimed  at  the  implementation  of  CAN  protocol  using  PIC  for  vehicle  monitoring  system  and  security  using  Principle 
component  analysis.  The  main  feature  of  the  system  includes  monitoring  of  various  vehicles.  In  the  security  part,  The 
system  automatically  takes  photos  of  driver  and  compares  his  or  her  face  with  database  to  check  whether  he  is  an 
authenticated  driver  or  not.  He  can  have  access  to  the  vehicle  only  if  he  is  an  authenticated  driver.  If  he  is  not  an 
authenticated driver access to the vehicle will not be provided. Also, the owner of the vehicle gets an image of the theft via

I. INTRODUCTION 

A.  Control Area Network  
 

The Controller Area Network (CAN) is an attractive alternative in the automotive and automation industries due to 
its ease in use, low cost and provided reduction in wiring complexity. The priority based message scheduling used in CAN 
has  a  number  of  advantages,  some  of  the  most  important  being  the  efficient  bandwidth  utilization,  flexibility,  simple 
implementation  and  small  overhead.  CAN  is  a  serial  bus  communications  protocol  developed  by  Bosch  [3]  (an  electrical 
equipment manufacturer in Germany) in the  early 1980s. Thereafter, CAN was standardized as ISO-11898 and ISO-11519, 
establishing  itself  as  the  standard protocol  for  in  vehicle  networking  in  the  auto  industry.  By  networking  the  electronics  in 
vehicles with CAN, however, they could be controlled from a central point, the Engine Control Unit (ECU), thus increasing 
functionality,  adding  modularity,  and  making  diagnostic  processes  more  efficient.  CAN  offer  an  efficient  communication 
protocol  between  sensors,  actuators,  controllers,  and  other  nodes  in  real-time  applications,  and  is  known  for  its  simplicity, 
reliability, and high performance [1].

B.  Biometrics  
 

 Is  used  in  the  process  of  authentication  of  a  person  by  verifying  or  identifying  that  a  user  requesting  a  network 
resource is  who he, she, or it claims  to be, and  vice versa. It uses the property that a human trait associated  with a person 
itself  like  structure  of  finger,  face  details  etc.  By  comparing  the  existing  data  with  the  incoming  data  we  can  verify  the 
identity of a particular person [2]. There are many types of biometric system like fingerprint recognition, face detection and 
recognition, iris recognition etc., these traits are used for human identification in surveillance system, criminal identification. 
Advantages  of  using  these  traits  for  identification  are  that  they  cannot  be  forgotten  or  lost.  These  are  unique  features  of  a 
human being which is being used widely [3]. 

The  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  one  of  the  most  successful  techniques  that  have  been  used  in  image 
recognition and compression. PCA is a   statistical method under the broad title of factor analysis. The purpose of PCA is to 
reduce the large dimensionality of the data space (observed variables) to the smaller intrinsic dimensionality of feature space 
(independent  variables),  which  are  needed  to  describe  the  data  economically.  This  is  the  case  when  there  is  a  strong 
correlation between observed variables. 

Here Control Area Network is used to monitor the vehicle critical parts like Temperature, fuel level, Air bag control. 
This paper also included security for Car system. If owner lost the key, in that time also owner of that car can access the key 
by  sending  predefined  message  to  the  microcontroller,  then  microcontroller  receives  that  message  and  if  that  message  is 
correct than microcontroller sends a predefined question to that particular number and microcontroller waits for the answer, 
once  owner  send  an  answer  microcontroller  compares  that  answer  with  the  predefined  answer.  If  it  matches  than 
microcontroller opens the driver side door automatically. So that owner can access his car. Once the driver of that car sat on 
the seat, microcontroller initiate the web cam, so that web cam captures the image of that driver, matlab compares that image 
with database images, once its matches microcontroller ignites the car engine automatically. If not that particular image send 
to the owner E-mail and controller send the current location using global positioning system.

II. RELATED WORK  

 Douglas W. Gage (1995) discusses the history of developments made in control of unmanned ground vehicles. The 
basic  idea  of  a  digital  driving  system  and  how  to  formulate  digital  driving  system  architecture  have  been  discussed  by 
Wuhong Wang (2002), C. Little (1999), Gerd Krämer (2001), Fei-Yue Wang et al (2002), Julian Kolodko et al (2003). Luis 
Manuel  et  al  (2002)  and  Richard  Bishop  (2000)  have  dealt  with  the  various  features  that  can  be  included  to  improve  the 
driving experience in a digital driving system. Tatsuya Yoshida et al (2004) discuss the concept of adaptive driving systems. 
U. Franke et al (1999) discusses various approaches to develop autonomous vehicles. The issues in developing a CAN based 
embedded network system have been dealt by Robert Boys (2004), Steve Corrigan (2002) and John Rinaldi et al (2003). The 
website  of  Microchip  Inc.  USA  gives  information  about  how  to  develop  a  CAN  system  using  their  microcontroller  PIC 
18F4685. The website of CAN in Automation (CiA) provides information about the basics of CAN protocol. 
 
B.  Face Recognition 
 
                  According to Jolliffe (2002) it is generally accepted that PCA was first described by Karl  Pearson in 1901. In his 
article  ”  On  lines  and  planes  of  closest  fit  to  systems  of  points  in  space,”    Pearson  (1901)  discusses  the  graphical 
representation of data and lines that best represent the  data. He concludes that “The best-fitting straight line to a system of 
points coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correlation ellipsoid”. He also states that the analysis used in  his 
paper can be applied to multiple variables.  However, PCA was not widely used until the development of computers. It is not 
really  feasible  to  do  PCA  by  hand  when  number  of  variables  is  greater  than  four,  but  it  is  exactly  for  larger    amount  of 
variables  that  PCA  is  really  useful,  so  the  full  potential  of  PCA  could  not  be  used  until    after  the  spreading  of  computers 
(Jolliffe, 2002). According to Jolliffe (2002) significant contributions to the development of PCA were made by  Hotelling 
(1933) and Girshick (1936; 1939) before the expansion in the interest towards PCA. In  1960s. as the interest in PCA rose, 
important contributors were Anderson (1963) with a  theoretical discussion, Rao (1964) with numerous new ideas concerning 
uses,  interpretations  and    extensions  of  PCA,  Gower  (1966)  with  discussion  about  links  between  PCA  and  other  statistical  
techniques and Jeffers (1967) with a practical application in two case studies. 
 
C.  Traditional techniques 
 
i.  Geometric approach 

This  is  the  historical  way  to  recognize  people.  Geometric  features  may  be  generated  by  segments,  perimeters  and 
areas  of  some  figures  formed  by  the  points.  The  featured  set  is  studied  to  compare  the  recognition  result.  Distances  in  the 
feature  space  from  a  template  image  to  every  image  in  the  database  were  calculated.  Following  to  the  FERET  protocol,  5

nearest face images were derived and if there were photos of the query person then the result was considered positive. Each 
image  was  tested  as  a  query  and  compared  with  others.  The  approach  was  robust,  but  it  main  problem  is  automatic  point 
location. Some problem arises if image is of bad quality or several points are covered by hair. 
 
ii.  Photometric approach 
 
     It  is  a  statistical  approach  that  distils  an  image  into  values  and  compares  the  values  with  templates  to  eliminate 
variances. It relies on the input image in the presence of light and the geometric location of different angles. The photometric 
transformation is implemented on the source image, does not take into account photometric changes, i.e. changes in the pixel. 
The main restriction in this approach is that multiple registered images of the same person is required. Since it recognizes the 
new image by checking that it is spanned in a linear subspace of the multiple gallery images, it cannot handle the new images 
of a different person which is not included in the gallery set[4]. 
 

III. HARDWARE 

 

       Fig 1 shows the vehicle monitoring system, sensors are connected to each node. Microcontroller receives the data from 
the sensors and data exchange is also possible. If node 3 wants data from the node 1, node 3 has to send a remote request to 
the  node  1,  so  that  node  1  will  transmit  the  sensor  value  to  the  requested  frame.  So  that  by  sending  the  remote  request 
continuously node 3 will monitors the various nodes in the   system. 
 
Fig  2  shows  the  security  system,  whenever  an  owner  lost  his  key,  he  can  access  his  vehicle  by  sending  a  predefined 
message to the security system. GSM receives the message, and controller compare that message with predefined text, if it 
matches controller sends a pre-defined question to an owner cell, then owner has to send answer to that question. Then GSM 
receives  the  answer  and  send  that  to  controller,  once  again  controller  compares  that  text  with  predefined,  if  it  matches 
controller automatically opens the driver side door. 
 
Then  monitoring  system  continuously  monitoring  the  seat  belt  of  the  driver  seat,  if  metal  sensor  senses  monitoring 
system sends a signal to the security system. Then security system initiate the web cam, webcam captures the image of the 
driver,  using  Principle  Component  Analysis  technique  compare  the  captured  image  with  data  bas  stored  images,  if  image 
matches  with  those  data  base  images  security  part  ignite  the  engine,  if  not  security  part  sends  that  captured  image  to  the 
owner Email id and it will also send the location information    
 
A.  LDR Sensor 
        A photo  resistor or light-dependent  resistor (LDR) is  a  light-controlled  variable resistor.  The resistance of  a  photo 
resistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photo resistor can 
be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. A photo resistor is made of a 
high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as a few mega ohms (MΩ), while in 
the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on photo resistor exceeds a 
certain frequency, photons absorbed  by  the  semiconductor  give  bound electrons enough  energy  to  jump  into  the conduction 
band.  The  resulting  free  electrons  (and  their hole partners)  conduct  electricity,  thereby  lowering resistance.  The  resistance 
range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors 
may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands. 
 
 
B.  Glass Breakage Sensor 
 
Glass  break  detectors  usually  use  a  microphone,  which  monitors  any  noise  or  vibrations  coming  from  the  glass.  If  the 
vibrations  exceed  a  certain  threshold  (that  is  sometimes  user  selectable)  they  are  analysed  by  detector  circuitry.  Simpler 
detectors  simply  use  narrowband  microphones  tuned  to  frequencies  typical  of  glass  shattering,  and  react  to  sound  above 
certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal 
transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity  threshold 
are breached. 
 
C.  Distance Sensor 
        A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity 
sensor  often  emits  an electromagnetic field  or  a  beam  of electromagnetic  radiation (infrared,  for  instance),  and  looks  for 
changes in the field or return  signal. The object being sensed is  often referred to as the  proximity  sensor's target. Different 
proximity sensor targets demand different sensors.

For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always 
requires a metal target. 
 
D.  Load Sensor 
        A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens 
in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures 
the  deformation  (strain)  as  an  electrical  signal,  because  the  strain  changes  the  effective  electrical  resistance  of  the  wire.  A 
load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (Quarter 
Bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few mill 
volts  and  requires  amplification  by  an instrumentation  amplifier before  it  can  be  used.  The  output  of  the  transducer  can  be 
scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer.  
 

IV. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

 

        There  are  several  techniques  behind  face  recognition;  we  would  be  focusing  on  real  time  application  of  Principal 
Component  Analysis  using  Eigen  faces.  In  this  method  the  difference  between  a  given  face  image  and  a  mean  image  is 
weighted, which is obtained by averaging a predefined set of faces. The training set is a group of face images from which the 
mean face is calculated. Face recognition takes place by linearly projecting the image to a low dimensional image space and 
weighting the difference with respect to a set of eigenvectors. If the difference (weight) is bellow certain threshold, the image 
is recognized as a known face; otherwise, the face can be classified as an unknown face or not a face at all. This is done with

the  help  of  mat  lab  code  initializing  the  webcam  of  a  laptop,  capturing  the  image  and  comparing  it  with  the  database  of 
images (training images) present in the laptop. 
        Perform face recognition, the similarity score is calculated between an input face image and each of the training images. 
The matched face is the one with the highest similarity, and the magnitude of the similarity score indicates the confidence of 
the match (with a unit value indicating an exact match). There are various steps in performing this face recognition, we will 
be discussing step by step, however before that we will be discussing about Eigen faces used in this paper.  
 
 
A. 
       The steps involve in initialization process are 

The Eigen faces approach for face recognition involves the following two operations: 

Initialization process 

  Acquire a set of training images. 
  Calculate  the  Eigen  faces  from  the  training  set,  keeping  only  the  best  M  images  with  the  highest  Eigen  values. 

 

These M images define the “face space”. As new faces are experienced, the Eigen faces can be updated. 
·Calculate  the  corresponding  distribution  in  M-dimensional  weight  space  for  each  known  individual  (training 
image), by projecting their face images onto the face. 

 
B.  Recognition process 
 
        Having initialized the system, next process involves is recognition process and the steps involves in this process are, 

  Given an image to be recognized, calculate a set of weights of the M Eigen faces by projecting the it onto each of 

the Eigen faces. 

  Determine if the image is a face at all by checking to see if the image is sufficiently close to the face space. 
 
 
 

If it is a face, classify the weight pattern as either a known person or as unknown. 
(Optional) Update the Eigen faces and/or weight patterns. 
(Optional) Calculate the characteristic weight pattern of the new face image, and incorporate into the known faces. 

 

V. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

A.  Acquire a set of training images 
 
Training set of m images of size N x N are represented by vectors of size N2. Each face is represented by Г1, Г2, Г3… ГM 
 
.Feature vector of a face is stored in a N x N matrix. Now, this two dimensional vector is changed to one dimensional vector. 
For example, 

     
[
     

] = Гi  =   [

  
  
  
  

] 

Each face image is represented by the vector Гi.   

B.  Mean and Mean Centred Images 
 
 

Average face image is calculated by, 

 

Ψ = (1/M) ∑   

    i                                                  

Ψ = ( 1 +  1+  1+ ………. +  M) / M. 

 

Each face differs from the average by Φi = Гi - Ψ which is called mean cantered image. 
 
 C.  Covariance Matrix 
 
A covariance matrix is constructed as C = A AT, where A = [Φ1, Φ1, Φ2 …. ΦM ]  of size N2x N2.Size of covariance matrix 
 
will be N2 x N2. Eigen vectors corresponding to this covariance matrix is needed to be calculated, but that will be a tedious 
task therefore, calculate ATA Size of this matrix M x M. Then calculate the Eigen vector and Eigen value of the covariance 
matrix of size M x M. 
Consider the eigenvectors vi of AT A such that, 

ATA Xi = λi Xi 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                      38 
 

Lingaraju M R et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 34-42 

Now multiplying the above equation with A both sides we get,  

AAT (AXi) = λi(AXi) 

D.  Eigen Face Space 
 
 
The Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix AAT are AXi which is denoted by Ui. Ui resembles facial images which look 
ghostly and are called Eigen faces. Eigen vectors correspond to each Eigen face in the face space and discard the faces for 
which Eigen values are zero thus reducing the Eigen face space to an extent. The Eigen faces are ranked according to their 
usefulness in characterizing the variation among the images. 
A face image can be projected into this face space by, 
 

k = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

k = 1,  .... , M, where (Гk -  Ψ) is the mean centered image. 
Hence projection of each image can be obtained as Ω1 for projection of image Ω1 and Ω2 for projection of image Ω2 and 
hence forth. 
 
E.  Recognition Step 
 
 

The test image, Г, is projected into the face space to obtain a vector, Ω as  

Ω = UT (Гk -  Ψ) 

The distance of Ω to each face is called Euclidean distance and defined by 

k = ||Ω – Ωk ||2 
Where k = 1, … ,M   where Ωk is a vector describing the kth face class. 
A face is classified as belonging to class k when the minimum €k is below some Chosen threshold θc . otherwise the face is 
classified as unknown. θc, is half the largest distance between any two face images: 
 

€2

where  j, k = 1, …… , M  
 Find the distance € between the original test image Г and its re-constructed image from the Eigen face Гf  
 

θc = (1/2)max j,k ||Ωj – Ωk || 

€2 = || Г - Гf ||2 

Where Гf  = U * Ω + Ψ. 
 
If € >= θc then input image is not even a face image and not recognized. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input image is a face image but it is recognized as unknown face. 
If € < θc and €k > θ for all k then input images are the individual face image associated with the class vector Ω k[5]. 
 
 
 

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

        This thesis is concerned  about implementation of CAN nodes for  monitoring parameters and security  for car systems. 
The  monitoring  parameters  are  temperature,  battery  voltage,  light  due  to  spark  or  fire  and  CO  level  in  the  exhaust.  For 
monitoring the above parameters, LM35 sensor, LDR and MQ6 sensors are used. For implementing this, the programming of 
LED,  ADC  and  LCD  interfacing  with  microcontroller  is  done  using  Embedded  C.  In  this  project,  the  real  time  face 
recognition  is  achieved  using  PCA  algorithm.    An  embedded  automotive  security  system  is  presented  in  this  paper.  Face 
recognition  is  a  both  challenging  and  important  recognition  technique.  It  has  been  shown  that  a  proposed  system  can  be 
implemented at any types of automobiles and can be used at any place where face recognition is needed. This system reduces 
increased  amount  of  vehicle  theft  present  today.  Comparing  with  traditional  automotive  system,  this  system  does  not  need 
any sensor, and thus it is highly reliable.
