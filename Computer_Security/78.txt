Abstract: - Automobile tracking in the private and defense sector has required a vast amount of 
research and development. This paper presents the two-way multiple vehicles tracking system 
using GSM network and satellite communication. The multi-vehicle tracking system uses an 
extensive combination of global positioning system (GPS), GSM network and Digital mapping 
with cost effective hardware solution. The tracking system works on the synchronization of the 
vehicle client unit and the base station. Multi-layered digitized maps results real-time and precise 
location tracking and provides the various detail information of environment. The system is 
exploited for vehicle security providing opportunity to remote server to secure the vehicle in case 
of theft with indispensable anti theft device. Moreover the system provides text guidance to the 
client through embedded LCD and KEYPAD interfacing.

1 Introduction 
Over the past decade, real-time tracking and 
management of vehicles has been a field of 
mounting  interest.  Now  it  has  developed 
into a powerful and marketable package due 
to its low-cost and varying facilities such as 
Anti-theft modules and Client identification.

fairly  simple  flow  statement,  the  system

4.1 Hardware 
 The  operator  or  base  station  is  based  on  a 
laptop  computer  which  is  the  core  of  the 
operator  unit.  Attached  to  this  is  the  GSM 
Engine  which  is  serially  connected  to  our 
operator unit. 
 
     
4.2 Software 
The software used in this tracking  
System is a module designed in Visual basic 
and has been designed to respond and depict 
real-time  movements  and  changes.  As 
mentioned  below  the  GUI  offers  Panning 
and Zooming abilities and supports dynamic 
tracking  for  standard  geometric  shapes  like 
rectangles or lines. 
     The  base  station  is  the  main  operation 
and 
tracking  command  center  where 
tracking is performed on the basis of client-
ID  monitoring  and  Authentication  codes 
along  with  any  marketed  features  such  as 
city bounds or restrictions. The base station

the 
system 
extremely secure and practical. 
 
 
5 MAPS 
The  Real-time  Tracking 
this  Fleet 
monitoring  system  offers  is  based  entirely 
on  maps  which  make  these  maps  a  very 
crucial  part  of  the  design.  The  digitized-
maps used in this project required the most 
work since these were not available and had 
to be created from the ground up. 
 
 
 5.1 Digitizing 
The  scanned  maps  were  custom  digitized 
.This required quite a bit of GPS data for our 
Reference points which are further used for 
complete  geo-referencing  of  our  maps. 
These maps are regional geographical pieces 
which are scanned and setup to be digitized 
and geo-referenced.  Once the Latitude and 
longitude  details  have  been  processes,  it 
requires quite a bit of expertise to produce a 
fully digitized map.

Abstract: - Automobile tracking in the private and defense sector has required a vast amount of 
research and development. This paper presents the two-way multiple vehicles tracking system 
using GSM network and satellite communication. The multi-vehicle tracking system uses an 
extensive combination of global positioning system (GPS), GSM network and Digital mapping 
with cost effective hardware solution. The tracking system works on the synchronization of the 
vehicle client unit and the base station. Multi-layered digitized maps results real-time and precise 
location tracking and provides the various detail information of environment. The system is 
exploited for vehicle security providing opportunity to remote server to secure the vehicle in case 
of theft with indispensable anti theft device. Moreover the system provides text guidance to the 
client through embedded LCD and KEYPAD interfacing.

1 Introduction 
Over the past decade, real-time tracking and 
management of vehicles has been a field of 
mounting  interest.  Now  it  has  developed 
into a powerful and marketable package due 
to its low-cost and varying facilities such as 
Anti-theft modules and Client identification. 
Although the system may be described in a 
fairly  simple  flow  statement,  the  system 
elements are rather complexed and polished 
to the perfect practical application. 
The  GPS  device 
for 
determination  of  vehicle  position  co-
ordinates based on which the vehicles status 
is identified [1, 2, 7, 11]. The GPS module 
also  provides  us  with  the  tracked-object 
speed  based  on  location  times  and  distance 
as  opposed  to  the  speeds  displayed  by  the 
speedometer of the vehicle. 
Following  this  comes  the  microcontroller 
which  processes  these  co-ordinates  from 
GPS  and  produces  a  location  point  on  the 
digital maps [8, 9].                                       
 

 
These  are 
regional  world  maps  geo-
referenced  to  identify  location.  Due  to 
unavailability  of  these  pre-digitized  maps 
the  team  was  required  to  create  them  on 
their  own.  Giving  the  Fleet  monitoring 
system a rather customized touch [5]. GSM 
is our core communication engine owing to 
which the position of the vehicle is notified 
to the client as well as our base station [10]. 
The information sent and received is done so 
using  short  messaging  which  makes  this 
system further cost-efficient [10].  
The  fleet  monitoring  system  is  the  fruit 
reaped  from  all  previous  and  ongoing 
research in all applied technologies, making 
it 
these 
technologies combined.

2.1 Client Unit 
The  client  unit  is  a  combinational  structure 
of  a  GPS  device,  a  microcontroller  and  a 
GSM engine also featuring a Keypad and an 
LCD for user interface. 
 
 
2.1.1 GPS Device 
The  GPS  device,  as  the  name  suggests  is 
used primarily for location and geographical 
position  of  the  object  vehicle  [1,  6,  7]. 
Powered  by  the  car’s  dynamo,  the  GPS 
device  accumulates  Latitude  and  longitude

2.1.2 Microcontroller  
The  microcontroller  is  the  most  important 
element  of  this  unit  since  it  acts  as  the 
transmitter  as  well  as  the  receiver  at  the 
same  time,  interpreting  information  to  and 
fro  [9].  The  microcontroller  used  is  the 
Atmel 89C52 which has a serial RS232 port 
which  we  utilize  for  both  the  GSM  engine 
and  the  GPS  device  as  both  are  serial 
communication components. 
 
 
2.1.3 GSM Engine 
 The  GSM 
core 
communication  medium  which  receives  the 
data 
via 
microcontroller  and  transmits  it  to  the  base 
station  and  also  puts  through  data  received 
from the base station to the microcontroller 
[11].  The  mode  of 
is  short 
messaging  which  is  an  attractive  and  cost 
efficient service offered by GSM. 
 
 
2.1.4 LCD AND KEYPAD 
The  LCD  (liquid  crystal  display)  and  the 
KEYPAD  are  the  only  user  interface  units 
on  the  client  and  can  be  used  to  create 
messages  and  communication  statements  to 
be  sent  to  the  base  station  or  other  fellow 
clients.  The  LCD 
are 
configured  for  the  microcontroller  using 
software  KEIL®,  which  provides  efficient 
control over the modules. 
 
 
2.2 Client-Unit Software  
  The  client  unit  microcontroller  was 
programmed using C++ language.

  As  mentioned  above,  the  GSM  engine  is 
our 
and 
medium.  An  advantage  of  which  is  the 
Tracking  made  possible  everywhere  the 
service  is  available.  The  Fleet  Monitoring 
system  can  be  customized  even  further  by 
the  purchase  of  bandwidth  on  a  corporate 
level  and  make  this  system  ever  further 
reaching [4, 12].

3.3 Full-Duplex Communication 
The  new,  never  before,  introduction  in  this 
project is that it offers the client unit a full-
duplex 
“two-way 
communication”  skills.  The  clients  can 
communicate  with  the  main  base  station  as 
well  as  with  each  other  provided  they  are 
familiar  with  the  client-IDs,  and  since  they 
are fitted with a gsm engine, an LCD and a

6 Applications 
The  Application  possibilities  of  this  design 
are vast and rather numerous. Ranging from 
Defense  to  standard  commercial  business, 
this  device  makes  a  promising  stand. 
Starting  from  a  “multi-vehicle”  tracking 
device, it transforms into a Fleet-monitoring 
system  and  further  into  an  anti-theft  car 
security  service  which  can  even  work 
through cross border transport.  
 
 
6.1 Anti-Theft Device 
An  Additional 
feature 
introduced  in  this  system  is  the  “cost 
Efficient”  vehicle 
tracking.  A  standard, 
older  and  cheaper  version  of  the  Anti-theft 
switch,  when  installed  in  the  car,  can  be 
activated  and  deactivated  upon  GSM

The  introduction  of  this  Anti-theft  device 
gives  the  base  station  the  perfect  level  of 
control  and  makes  the  service,  that  this 
design  offers,  very  valuable  which  is  not 
done before.  
 
 
6.2 Post-Border tracking 
Seeing 
that  has  been 
developed works on available GSM Services 
another possibility is that of tracking beyond 
borders.  Using 
roaming 
features  on 
the  used  cellular  service 
provider, the client unit can be traced in any 
GSM-Networked country all the while being 
mapped in real-time.  
 
 
6.3 Safety and Law enforcement 
A  rather  usable  feature  of  this  specific 
design  can  very  easily  be  implemented  in 
highway  and  road  safety enforcement  since 
the  GPS  module  on  the  client  unit  also 
provides  vehicle  speed  details  to  the  server 
unit based on which speed warnings may be 
delivered.  The  difference  between  the  GPS 
tracked  speed  (Km/h)  and 
the  vehicle 
speedometer  (Km/h)  can  be  seen  in  the 
following graph-1

1 Introduction 
Over the past decade, real-time tracking and 
management of vehicles has been a field of 
mounting  interest.  Now  it  has  developed 
into a powerful and marketable package due 
to its low-cost and varying facilities such as 
Anti-theft modules and Client identification. 
Although the system may be described in a 
fairly  simple  flow  statement,  the  system 
elements are rather complexed and polished 
to the perfect practical application. 
The  GPS  device 
for 
determination  of  vehicle  position  co-
ordinates based on which the vehicles status 
is identified [1, 2, 7, 11]. The GPS module 
also  provides  us  with  the  tracked-object 
speed  based  on  location  times  and  distance 
as  opposed  to  the  speeds  displayed  by  the 
speedometer of the vehicle. 
Following  this  comes  the  microcontroller 
which  processes  these  co-ordinates  from 
GPS  and  produces  a  location  point  on  the 
digital maps [8, 9].                                       
 

 
These  are 
regional  world  maps  geo-
referenced  to  identify  location.  Due  to 
unavailability  of  these  pre-digitized  maps 
the  team  was  required  to  create  them  on 
their  own.  Giving  the  Fleet  monitoring 
system a rather customized touch [5]. GSM 
is our core communication engine owing to 
which the position of the vehicle is notified 
to the client as well as our base station [10]. 
The information sent and received is done so 
using  short  messaging  which  makes  this 
system further cost-efficient [10].  
The  fleet  monitoring  system  is  the  fruit 
reaped  from  all  previous  and  ongoing

2.1.2 Microcontroller  
The  microcontroller  is  the  most  important 
element  of  this  unit  since  it  acts  as  the 
transmitter  as  well  as  the  receiver  at  the 
same  time,  interpreting  information  to  and 
fro  [9].  The  microcontroller  used  is  the 
Atmel 89C52 which has a serial RS232 port 
which  we  utilize  for  both  the  GSM  engine 
and  the  GPS  device  as  both  are  serial 
communication components. 
 
 
2.1.3 GSM Engine 
 The  GSM 
core 
communication  medium  which  receives  the 
data 
via 
microcontroller  and  transmits  it  to  the  base 
station  and  also  puts  through  data  received 
from the base station to the microcontroller 
[11].  The  mode  of 
is  short 
messaging  which  is  an  attractive  and  cost 
efficient service offered by GSM. 
 
 
2.1.4 LCD AND KEYPAD 
The  LCD  (liquid  crystal  display)  and  the 
KEYPAD  are  the  only  user  interface  units 
on  the  client  and  can  be  used  to  create 
messages  and  communication  statements  to 
be  sent  to  the  base  station  or  other  fellow 
clients.  The  LCD 
are 
configured  for  the  microcontroller  using 
software  KEIL®,  which  provides  efficient 
control over the modules.

3 Communication 
  As  mentioned  above,  the  GSM  engine  is 
our 
and 
medium.  An  advantage  of  which  is  the 
Tracking  made  possible  everywhere  the 
service  is  available.  The  Fleet  Monitoring 
system  can  be  customized  even  further  by 
the  purchase  of  bandwidth  on  a  corporate 
level  and  make  this  system  ever  further 
reaching [4, 12].

3.3 Full-Duplex Communication 
The  new,  never  before,  introduction  in  this 
project is that it offers the client unit a full-
duplex 
“two-way 
communication”  skills.  The  clients  can 
communicate  with  the  main  base  station  as 
well  as  with  each  other  provided  they  are 
familiar  with  the  client-IDs,  and  since  they 
are fitted with a gsm engine, an LCD and a 
keypad,  this  is  no  great  task  for  them.  In 
Fig.5  the  communication  between  different 
clients  and  base  station  (server  unit)  is 
shown.

4.1 Hardware 
 The  operator  or  base  station  is  based  on  a 
laptop  computer  which  is  the  core  of  the 
operator  unit.  Attached  to  this  is  the  GSM 
Engine  which  is  serially  connected  to  our 
operator unit. 
 
     
4.2 Software 
The software used in this tracking  
System is a module designed in Visual basic 
and has been designed to respond and depict 
real-time  movements  and  changes.  As 
mentioned  below  the  GUI  offers  Panning 
and Zooming abilities and supports dynamic 
tracking  for  standard  geometric  shapes  like 
rectangles or lines. 
     The  base  station  is  the  main  operation 
and 
tracking  command  center  where 
tracking is performed on the basis of client-
ID  monitoring  and  Authentication  codes 
along  with  any  marketed  features  such  as 
city bounds or restrictions. The base station 
client-to-client 
can 
communication  making 
the 
system 
extremely secure and practical. 
 
 
5 MAPS 
The  Real-time  Tracking 
this  Fleet 
monitoring  system  offers  is  based  entirely 
on  maps  which  make  these  maps  a  very 
crucial  part  of  the  design.  The  digitized-
maps used in this project required the most 
work since these were not available and had 
to be created from the ground up. 
 
 
 5.1 Digitizing 
The  scanned  maps  were  custom  digitized 
.This required quite a bit of GPS data for our 
Reference points which are further used for 
complete  geo-referencing  of  our  maps. 
These maps are regional geographical pieces 
which are scanned and setup to be digitized 
and geo-referenced.  Once the Latitude and 
longitude  details  have  been  processes,  it 
requires quite a bit of expertise to produce a 
fully digitized map.

5.1.1 Layers 
Layers 
geographical 
are 
differentiation  between  various  objects  or 
ones  such  as  highways,  residencies  or  just 
buildings.  The  Amount  of  layers  that  are 
added is a choice that is made by the design 
team based on how specific and precise the 
requirements are. 
As  the  layers  are  made  on  the  same  maps 
they are color coded for object recognition. 
 Each  layer  is  exported  onto  a  shape  file 
which is a file extension standard recognized 
by  all  map  generation  software’s.  We  have

5.2 GUI (Graphical  User Interface) 
The  Graphical  user  interface  on  the  base 
station  has  been  designed  using  Visual 
Basic. The objective of which was to display 
maps with various layers, add remove layers 
in runtime, and to track vehicle position and 
path [3]. 
The  add  and  remove  buttons  which  have   
been  included  in  the  GUI  application  are 
used  for  including  or  deleting  unrequited 
layers  from  the  map.  The  GUI  application 
includes  features  such  as  Pan  and  Zoom 
control  along  with  Layer-combinations 
accessed directly using “combo” buttons. 
The GUI has the option to display any map 
of  the  major  cities  of  Pakistan.  It  has  the 
major  option  of  adding  and  removing  any 
layer  as  required  or  clearing  the  whole 
screen. The GUI includes the availability of 
sending  and  receiving  message  which  is

in  applications  of 
the  bottom 

interfaced  with  LCD  and  KEYPAD.  It 
includes  one  major  application  of  fleet 
monitoring 
of 
controlling  cars  engine  which  will  be 
discussed 
this 
later 
product.  Along 
the  current 
position of the mouse cursor on the screen in 
latitude/longitude is displayed. 
 The 
supports  dynamic 
tracking for geometric shapes such as points, 
lines,  rectangles  or  ellipses.  For  multiple 
vehicles  tracked  at  once,  the  application 
automatically assigns different colors to the 
tracking  points.  Final  GUI  of  our  tracking 
system is shown in fig.8.

6 Applications 
The  Application  possibilities  of  this  design 
are vast and rather numerous. Ranging from 
Defense  to  standard  commercial  business, 
this  device  makes  a  promising  stand. 
Starting  from  a  “multi-vehicle”  tracking 
device, it transforms into a Fleet-monitoring 
system  and  further  into  an  anti-theft  car 
security  service  which  can  even  work 
through cross border transport.  
 
 
6.1 Anti-Theft Device 
An  Additional 
feature 
introduced  in  this  system  is  the  “cost 
Efficient”  vehicle 
tracking.  A  standard, 
older  and  cheaper  version  of  the  Anti-theft 
switch,  when  installed  in  the  car,  can  be 
activated  and  deactivated  upon  GSM

communication  with  the  microcontroller.  
The  introduction  of  this  Anti-theft  device 
gives  the  base  station  the  perfect  level  of 
control  and  makes  the  service,  that  this 
design  offers,  very  valuable  which  is  not 
done before.  
 
 
6.2 Post-Border tracking 
Seeing 
that  has  been 
developed works on available GSM Services 
another possibility is that of tracking beyond 
borders.  Using 
roaming 
features  on 
the  used  cellular  service 
provider, the client unit can be traced in any 
GSM-Networked country all the while being 
mapped in real-time.  
 
 
6.3 Safety and Law enforcement 
A  rather  usable  feature  of  this  specific 
design  can  very  easily  be  implemented  in 
highway  and  road  safety enforcement  since 
the  GPS  module  on  the  client  unit  also 
provides  vehicle  speed  details  to  the  server 
unit based on which speed warnings may be 
delivered.  The  difference  between  the  GPS 
tracked  speed  (Km/h)  and 
the  vehicle 
speedometer  (Km/h)  can  be  seen  in  the 
following graph-1

7 Results 
The  vehicle 
tracking  system  produced 
capital  results  and  the  vehicle  can  actually 
be tracked to a minor variation of 10m at the 
maximum.  On  a  commercial  foresight  the 
system,  once  installed,  completely  secures 
the  car  with  the  highly  efficient  anti-theft

device. With Variable locations and constant 
communication  maintenance 
the  system 
proves  an  all-terrain  tracker.  GSM-based 
communication can also be used to maintain 
a client-server communicative speed control 
which adds to the package. On top of all this 
there  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  vehicles 
that may be tracked as well as no map range 
limits, altogether making this design a rather 
attractive package.  
 
 
8 Conclusions 
   The vehicle tracking and fleet monitoring 
system  has  literally  countless  applications 
due  to  its  simple  design  and  compatibility. 
Its  has  a  grand  future  ahead  of  it  with 
advancement possibilities in all its modules 
and has already become a very big industry. 
         This 
future 
advancements  promise  perfect  car  security 
which  is  soon  to  become  a  requirement  of 
every car owner the world over.
