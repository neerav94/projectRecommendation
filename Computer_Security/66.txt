System: A Revolutionary Security Measure To 

Curb Forgery Menace.

Abstract:  Generating  certificates  for  the  graduating  students  is  an  area  of  administration  that  requires  significant  amounts  of  time  and  effort  in  a 
university environment, largely due to the number of students that graduate each year from both the full-time and the part-time studies. Students are 
expected to complete their clearance manually before receiving graduation certificates; this turns out to be very strenuous as much time and effort are 
wasted in accomplishing such. However, the certificate itself is the problem. It is of very low standard and quality, little or no integrity, very easy to forge, 
and not befitting for an institution such as the University of Ibadan. There is need to make use of   vast growing radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
technology to automate the graduation certificate system, which would not only standardize the format of the data collected by the university, but would 
also protect and secure the integrity of the university‟s graduation certificates,  reduces administrative work, and improve graduate‟s creditability ratios. 
The objective of the research is to provide an efficient software that can protect  the integrity of graduating certificate by embedding an encoded RFID 
tag  using  character  proximity  on  each  certificate  before  it  is  being  issued  in  order  to  reduce,  if  not  eradicate,  the  problem  of  forgery  and  fraudulent 
activities on certificates.

1. Introduction 
The 21th century has experience a lot of fraudulent activities 
and misconduct most especially in the practices of certificate 
forgery.  The  resultant  effect  of  these  habits  in  most  cases 
normally 
institution  concern. 
Certificate  menace is serious activities which can  be  curb  if 
not  eradicated  in  order  to  safe  guide  the  goodwill  of  the 
institutions  or  people  concern.  If  you‟re  looking  for  online 
experience degrees you should ensure that the institute has 
proper  accreditation.  Fake  degrees  can  destroy;  ruin  your 
academic  and  professional  career.  It  is  important  to  check 
with  the  accrediting  agencies  or  organization  to  know  the 
registered  institute  you  are  about  to  acquire  a  degree 
because  students  at  time  end  up  with  fake  college  degree. 
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes Radio 
Frequency  Identification.  Section  3:  System  Architecture, 
Section  4  Certificate  implementation  Section  5:  Character 
Proximity and solution Statement. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the use of a wireless 
non-contact 
radio-frequency 
electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to 
an  object,  for  the  purposes  of  automatic  identification  and 
tracking.  The  most  important  criterion  of  different  RFID 
systems is how the energy supplies of the transponder works 
which are classified into passive and active transponders.

Passive  transponders  do  not  have  any  power  supply  while 
the Active transponders have their own energy supply, e.g. in 
form  of  a  battery  or  a  solar  cell.  Here  the  power  supply  is 
used  to  provide  voltage  to  the  chip.  The  magnetic  or 
electromagnetic  field  received  by  the  reader  is  therefore  no 
longer necessary for the  power  supply  of  the  chip  (Kleist  et 
al., 2004) and (Rikcha, 2004). RFID systems rely on external 
communication  channels  link  in  which  data  is  registered  by 
the reader to other data pools. Security issues regarding the 
back-end  of  the  RFID  system  are  not  specific  but  the  RFID 
systems  rely  on  that  external  communication  channels  link 
registered  by  the  reader  to  other  data  pools.  There  are 
different  complex  procedures  for  storing  information  on 
transponders. The cloning of transponders can be efficiently 
prevented  by  using  authentication  and  encrypted  data 
transmission  according 
(Westhues,  2005).  The 
interception  of  the  communication  between  reader  and 
transponder is therefore one of the most prominent threats to 
RFID  technology.  The  ranges  given  for  RFID  systems  vary 
between a few centimetres (e.g. ISO/IEC 14443, 13.56 MHz) 
and  several  metres  (ISO/IEC  18000-6,  868  MHz)  and  apply 
to 
the 
transponder  to  be  supplied  with  power  and  to  generate 
several volts at the antenna. For the identification of vehicles, 
the required range of the RFID system is designed such that, 
at the maximum vehicle speed, the length of time spent in the 
interrogation  zone  is  sufficient  for  the  transmission  of  the 
required data as reported in (Bachthaler, 1997).

A component is an encapsulated, reusable, and replaceable 
part of your software; it is a physical piece of a system, such 
as a compiled object file, piece of source code, shared library 
or Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). Component diagrams model 
the  physical  software  components  and  the  relationships 
between  them,  show  the  structure  of  the  code  itself,  model 
source  code  and  relationships  between  files,  model  the

graduate  can  access 
the  Certificate  Application 
component  on  his/her  personal  computer  using  the 
ICertificatePortal  interface.  The  Certificate  Application 
component  requires  the  GraduateInfoDB  database  to 
store  and  retrieve  data  used  during  the  certificate 
application  process.  This  database  is  maintained  in  the 
ISP server.

In the component diagram for the proposed system, several 
software  components  have  been  identified.  For  example, 
RFID Smart Certificate Administration, Graduate Application, 
Facilities,  Graduate,  Certificate,  Application.  A  deployment 
diagram shows the structure of the run-time system, capture 
the hardware that will be used to implement the system and 
the  links between different items of hardware. It  models  the 
physical  hardware  elements  and  the  communication  paths 
between them. Ultimately, a deployment  diagram shows the 
system‟s  hardware,  the  software  installed  on  that  hardware, 
and  the  middleware  that  connects  the  disparate  machines 
together.

was use to established electromagnetic field to communicate 
with  the  Reader.  The  tags  was  programmed  with  the 
encrypted  version  of  each  graduate‟s  certificate  details 
before it is being appended onto the certificates to be issued. 

 
The  Graduate-user  part  is  a  module  in  the  implementation 
which  is  made  up  of  a  web-based  application  that  can  be 
deployed  on  a  network  for  easy  access  to  graduates  given 
the  correct  username  and  password.  Forms  are  used  to 
accept  data  from  the  graduates.  Forms  to  be  filled  by  the 
graduate  include  Bio-data  Information  Form  and  Clearance 
Information Form. The Supervisor-user part of the  proposed 
system  is  also  a  web-based  application  that  can  also  be 
deployed on a network to grant easy access to all clearance 
supervisors  given  the  correct  username  and  password. 
Supervisors are not expected to fill any form; they are only to 
indicate  if  a  graduate  has  been  cleared  from  his/her  own 
jurisdiction. The Administrator‟s part of the proposed system 
is solely a Java GUI application which will serve as a back-
end for monitoring the entire system – adding new, updating 
existing,  deleting  old,  and  viewing  graduates‟  and 
supervisors‟  details  –  as  well  as  creating  certificates  for 
cleared  graduates,  encrypting  and  decrypting  the  certificate 
information. The Administrator‟s part is a C-sharp application

accept  data  from  the  graduates.  Forms  to  be  filled  by  the 
graduate  include  Bio-data  Information  Form  and  Clearance 
Information Form. The Supervisor-user part of the  proposed 
system  is  also  a  web-based  application  that  can  also  be 
deployed on a network to grant easy access to all clearance 
supervisors  given  the  correct  username  and  password. 
Supervisors are not expected to fill any form; they are only to 
indicate  if  a  graduate  has  been  cleared  from  his/her  own 
jurisdiction. The Administrator‟s part of the proposed system 
is solely a Java GUI application which will serve as a back-
end for monitoring the entire system – adding new, updating 
existing,  deleting  old,  and  viewing  graduates‟  and 
supervisors‟  details  –  as  well  as  creating  certificates  for 
cleared  graduates,  encrypting  and  decrypting  the  certificate 
information. The Administrator‟s part is a C-sharp application

for  encoding  and  decoding  encrypted  data  on  RFID  tags 
using  the  RFID  reader  (reason  being  that  the  RFID  being 
used for this project supports C-sharp NOT Java). The major 
output of the proposed system is the RFID Smart Graduation 
Certificate. The proposed system also maintains a log of all 
operations  performed  and  by  whom.  However,  Reports 
concerning all activities which took place in generating such 
certificates has to  be  noted  and  presented  to  the  University 
Management  in  form  of  reports  to  aid  decision-making. 
Activity  Diagrams  of  the  implementation  describe  events 
needed  to  achieve  some  operation,  particularly  where  the 
operation is intended to achieve a number of different things 
that require coordination. They also describe how the events 
in a single use case relate to one another; in particular, use 
cases where activities may overlap and require coordination, 
i.e.  how  a  collection  of  use  cases  coordinate  to  create  a 
workflow for an organization as shown in figure 4.

5. Character Proximity and Solution Statement 
The design and development of character proximity scheme 
in  the  database  of  type  B  radio  frequency  identification  tag 
was  used  to  identify  the  originality  layout  in  the  database. 
During  implementation,  two  or  more  separately  matching 
term  occurrences  were  within  a  specified  distance,  where 
distance is the  number of intermediate  words or characters. 
In  the  proposed  system,  every  statement  is  executed  given 
the  right  condition  and  test  data.  For  example,  a  program 
statement that creates certificate would not be executed if an 
administrator  does  not  attempt  to  create  a  certificate  for  a 
graduate.  During  statement  testing,  program  statements 
under the  following  headings  were  tested  and  are  executed 
every  time  given  the  right  condition  and  test  data:  Add  new 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor  record,    Update 
existing administrator, graduate, or supervisor record,  Delete 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor 
  View

Character Proximity For RFID Smart Certificate 
System: A Revolutionary Security Measure To 

Curb Forgery Menace. 

Eze Chika Victor, Adeniji Oluwashola David 

 

 
Abstract:  Generating  certificates  for  the  graduating  students  is  an  area  of  administration  that  requires  significant  amounts  of  time  and  effort  in  a 
university environment, largely due to the number of students that graduate each year from both the full-time and the part-time studies. Students are 
expected to complete their clearance manually before receiving graduation certificates; this turns out to be very strenuous as much time and effort are 
wasted in accomplishing such. However, the certificate itself is the problem. It is of very low standard and quality, little or no integrity, very easy to forge, 
and not befitting for an institution such as the University of Ibadan. There is need to make use of   vast growing radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
technology to automate the graduation certificate system, which would not only standardize the format of the data collected by the university, but would 
also protect and secure the integrity of the university‟s graduation certificates,  reduces administrative work, and improve graduate‟s creditability ratios. 
The objective of the research is to provide an efficient software that can protect  the integrity of graduating certificate by embedding an encoded RFID 
tag  using  character  proximity  on  each  certificate  before  it  is  being  issued  in  order  to  reduce,  if  not  eradicate,  the  problem  of  forgery  and  fraudulent 
activities on certificates.

1. Introduction 
The 21th century has experience a lot of fraudulent activities 
and misconduct most especially in the practices of certificate 
forgery.  The  resultant  effect  of  these  habits  in  most  cases 
normally 
institution  concern. 
Certificate  menace is serious activities which can  be  curb  if 
not  eradicated  in  order  to  safe  guide  the  goodwill  of  the 
institutions  or  people  concern.  If  you‟re  looking  for  online 
experience degrees you should ensure that the institute has 
proper  accreditation.  Fake  degrees  can  destroy;  ruin  your 
academic  and  professional  career.  It  is  important  to  check 
with  the  accrediting  agencies  or  organization  to  know  the 
registered  institute  you  are  about  to  acquire  a  degree 
because  students  at  time  end  up  with  fake  college  degree. 
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes Radio 
Frequency  Identification.  Section  3:  System  Architecture, 
Section  4  Certificate  implementation  Section  5:  Character 
Proximity and solution Statement. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the use of a wireless 
non-contact 
radio-frequency 
electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to 
an  object,  for  the  purposes  of  automatic  identification  and 
tracking.  The  most  important  criterion  of  different  RFID 
systems is how the energy supplies of the transponder works 
which are classified into passive and active transponders.

Passive  transponders  do  not  have  any  power  supply  while 
the Active transponders have their own energy supply, e.g. in 
form  of  a  battery  or  a  solar  cell.  Here  the  power  supply  is 
used  to  provide  voltage  to  the  chip.  The  magnetic  or 
electromagnetic  field  received  by  the  reader  is  therefore  no 
longer necessary for the  power  supply  of  the  chip  (Kleist  et 
al., 2004) and (Rikcha, 2004). RFID systems rely on external 
communication  channels  link  in  which  data  is  registered  by 
the reader to other data pools. Security issues regarding the 
back-end  of  the  RFID  system  are  not  specific  but  the  RFID 
systems  rely  on  that  external  communication  channels  link 
registered  by  the  reader  to  other  data  pools.  There  are 
different  complex  procedures  for  storing  information  on 
transponders. The cloning of transponders can be efficiently 
prevented  by  using  authentication  and  encrypted  data 
transmission  according 
(Westhues,  2005).  The 
interception  of  the  communication  between  reader  and 
transponder is therefore one of the most prominent threats to 
RFID  technology.  The  ranges  given  for  RFID  systems  vary 
between a few centimetres (e.g. ISO/IEC 14443, 13.56 MHz) 
and  several  metres  (ISO/IEC  18000-6,  868  MHz)  and  apply 
to 
the 
transponder  to  be  supplied  with  power  and  to  generate 
several volts at the antenna. For the identification of vehicles, 
the required range of the RFID system is designed such that, 
at the maximum vehicle speed, the length of time spent in the 
interrogation  zone  is  sufficient  for  the  transmission  of  the 
required data as reported in (Bachthaler, 1997).  
 
3. Materials and Methods 
The proposed system is made up of system architecture that 
includes:  design  structure,  behavior  of  a  computer  system, 
microprocessor,  system  program  and  the  characteristics  of 
individual  components  and  how  they  interact.  In  order  to 
show the design, structure, physical elements, behaviour and 
individual components of the proposed system, three unique 
unified  modeling  tools  were  used.  These  are  Package 
diagram, Component diagram and Deployment diagram. The 
package  diagram  provides  a  way  to  group  related  elements 
and  to  scope  their  names;  it  also  provides  a  way  of 
visualizing  dependencies  between  parts  of  the  system.  The

package diagram for the proposed system below in figure 1 
shows a three-layered architecture, consisting of a Certificate 
Application  package,  an  Administrative  package,  and  an 
RFID  Security  package.  The  packages  represent  different 
generic  subsystems  of  the  proposed  system.  The  dashed 
arrows  represent  the  dependencies  among  the  packages. 
The packages participate in a client-supplier relationship

A component is an encapsulated, reusable, and replaceable 
part of your software; it is a physical piece of a system, such 
as a compiled object file, piece of source code, shared library 
or Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). Component diagrams model 
the  physical  software  components  and  the  relationships 
between  them,  show  the  structure  of  the  code  itself,  model 
source  code  and  relationships  between  files,  model  the 
structure  of  software  releases  and  specify  files  that  are 
compiled into an executable.

The  information  on  this  certificate  is  secured  and  protected 
from forgery and whenever the certificate is within the reader 
reading coverage area, the tag is detected and the encrypted 
file is read.  
 
4. Certificate Implementation 
The  deployment  diagram  of  the  implementation  for  the 
proposed  system  shows 
in 
client/server  architecture,  the  deployment  of  the  Certificate 
Application component to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
server, 
the  Administrator  Operator 
component to a high-end University server and the Graphical 
User  Interface  (GUI)  components  to  client/administrator 
workstations.  During  the  implementation  the  following  were 
considered and deduced.

graduate  can  access 
the  Certificate  Application 
component  on  his/her  personal  computer  using  the 
ICertificatePortal  interface.  The  Certificate  Application 
component  requires  the  GraduateInfoDB  database  to 
store  and  retrieve  data  used  during  the  certificate 
application  process.  This  database  is  maintained  in  the 
ISP server.  

b.  Alternatively, from the AdministratorInterface component, 
an  administrator  can  access  the  Administrator  Operator 
component  on  his/her  personal  computer  using  the 
IAdminPortal interface in figure 3. 

 

Fig 3: Deployment Diagram 

 

In the component diagram for the proposed system, several 
software  components  have  been  identified.  For  example, 
RFID Smart Certificate Administration, Graduate Application, 
Facilities,  Graduate,  Certificate,  Application.  A  deployment 
diagram shows the structure of the run-time system, capture 
the hardware that will be used to implement the system and 
the  links between different items of hardware. It  models  the 
physical  hardware  elements  and  the  communication  paths 
between them. Ultimately, a deployment  diagram shows the 
system‟s  hardware,  the  software  installed  on  that  hardware, 
and  the  middleware  that  connects  the  disparate  machines 
together.  
 
A  microchip  Student  Graduation  Certificate:  The  tag 
was use to established electromagnetic field to communicate 
with  the  Reader.  The  tags  was  programmed  with  the 
encrypted  version  of  each  graduate‟s  certificate  details 
before it is being appended onto the certificates to be issued. 

 
The  Graduate-user  part  is  a  module  in  the  implementation 
which  is  made  up  of  a  web-based  application  that  can  be 
deployed  on  a  network  for  easy  access  to  graduates  given 
the  correct  username  and  password.  Forms  are  used  to 
accept  data  from  the  graduates.  Forms  to  be  filled  by  the 
graduate  include  Bio-data  Information  Form  and  Clearance 
Information Form. The Supervisor-user part of the  proposed 
system  is  also  a  web-based  application  that  can  also  be 
deployed on a network to grant easy access to all clearance 
supervisors  given  the  correct  username  and  password. 
Supervisors are not expected to fill any form; they are only to 
indicate  if  a  graduate  has  been  cleared  from  his/her  own 
jurisdiction. The Administrator‟s part of the proposed system 
is solely a Java GUI application which will serve as a back-
end for monitoring the entire system – adding new, updating 
existing,  deleting  old,  and  viewing  graduates‟  and 
supervisors‟  details  –  as  well  as  creating  certificates  for 
cleared  graduates,  encrypting  and  decrypting  the  certificate 
information. The Administrator‟s part is a C-sharp application

using  the  RFID  reader  (reason  being  that  the  RFID  being 
used for this project supports C-sharp NOT Java). The major 
output of the proposed system is the RFID Smart Graduation 
Certificate. The proposed system also maintains a log of all

needed  to  achieve  some  operation,  particularly  where  the 
operation is intended to achieve a number of different things 
that require coordination. They also describe how the events 
in a single use case relate to one another; in particular, use 
cases where activities may overlap and require coordination, 
i.e.  how  a  collection  of  use  cases  coordinate  to  create  a 
workflow for an organization as shown in figure 4.

5. Character Proximity and Solution Statement 
The design and development of character proximity scheme 
in  the  database  of  type  B  radio  frequency  identification  tag 
was  used  to  identify  the  originality  layout  in  the  database. 
During  implementation,  two  or  more  separately  matching 
term  occurrences  were  within  a  specified  distance,  where 
distance is the  number of intermediate  words or characters. 
In  the  proposed  system,  every  statement  is  executed  given 
the  right  condition  and  test  data.  For  example,  a  program 
statement that creates certificate would not be executed if an 
administrator  does  not  attempt  to  create  a  certificate  for  a 
graduate.  During  statement  testing,  program  statements 
under the  following  headings  were  tested  and  are  executed 
every  time  given  the  right  condition  and  test  data:  Add  new 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor  record,    Update 
existing administrator, graduate, or supervisor record,  Delete 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor 
  View 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor  record,    Certificate 
Application  and  Graduate  Verification,    Certificate  Creation, 
Encryption  and  Decryption,    RFID  tag  writing  and  reading,  
Report Generation. The Taxonomy of people within the said 
university includes:  male or female that form the gender, the 
type of degree which can be undergraduate or postgraduate 
who  are  student.  Employer  can  be  administrator  and 
supervisor,  the  supervisor  can  be  associate  supervisor  or 
tenured  supervisor.  Nationalism  are  mainly  the  citizen  or 
foreigner. To give the important conceptual/domain modeling 
an indicator was introduced as shown in table 1 below.

intended to restrict the amount of access each administrator 
has  on  the  system‟s  data.  This  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of 
external  influence  or  forgery.  The  table  2  below  shows  the 
clearance levels of the developed system.

The  report  menu  of  the  administrative  homepage  contains 
report  generation  operations  that  can  be  performed  by 
administrators. An administrator, depending on his clearance 
level,  can  generate  systems  report  on  administrators, 
graduates,  supervisors,  certificates  and  RFID  tags.  These 
reports  enable  the  management  to  make  decisions  as 
regards the overall function of the system 
 
6. Result and Discussion 
Six  important  tests  were  carried  out  in  the  course  of 
implementation  and  deployment.  They  include  Statement 
Testing,  Branch  Testing,  Expression  Testing,  Path  Testing, 
Black-Box Test, and White-Box Test. During Statement Test, 
every statement is executed given the right condition and test 
data. For the  Branch Test a  probes  was  inserted  at  various 
branch  points  in  the  program  to  ensure  that  every  branch 
gets  executed  under  the  right  condition  such  as  Certificate 
Application,  Graduate  Verification  and  Administrative 
Operations.  The  Expression  Test 
that  every 
expression assumes a variety of valued in such a way that no 
expression can be replaced by a simpler expression and still 
pass  the  test.  In  the  Path  Testing,  data  was  selected  to 
ensure that all paths of the program have been executed. It is 
important  to  draw  a  conclusion  that  about  75%  path  was 
covered  during  unit  and  integration  testing.  The  black  box 
test involves viewing the test object from the  outside whose 
contents  are  unknown.  It  feeds  input  to  the  black  box  and 
notes  what  the  output  is.  The  test‟s  goal  is  to  be  sure  that

Character Proximity For RFID Smart Certificate 
System: A Revolutionary Security Measure To 

Curb Forgery Menace. 

Eze Chika Victor, Adeniji Oluwashola David 

 

 
Abstract:  Generating  certificates  for  the  graduating  students  is  an  area  of  administration  that  requires  significant  amounts  of  time  and  effort  in  a 
university environment, largely due to the number of students that graduate each year from both the full-time and the part-time studies. Students are 
expected to complete their clearance manually before receiving graduation certificates; this turns out to be very strenuous as much time and effort are 
wasted in accomplishing such. However, the certificate itself is the problem. It is of very low standard and quality, little or no integrity, very easy to forge, 
and not befitting for an institution such as the University of Ibadan. There is need to make use of   vast growing radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
technology to automate the graduation certificate system, which would not only standardize the format of the data collected by the university, but would 
also protect and secure the integrity of the university‟s graduation certificates,  reduces administrative work, and improve graduate‟s creditability ratios. 
The objective of the research is to provide an efficient software that can protect  the integrity of graduating certificate by embedding an encoded RFID 
tag  using  character  proximity  on  each  certificate  before  it  is  being  issued  in  order  to  reduce,  if  not  eradicate,  the  problem  of  forgery  and  fraudulent 
activities on certificates.

1. Introduction 
The 21th century has experience a lot of fraudulent activities 
and misconduct most especially in the practices of certificate 
forgery.  The  resultant  effect  of  these  habits  in  most  cases 
normally 
institution  concern. 
Certificate  menace is serious activities which can  be  curb  if 
not  eradicated  in  order  to  safe  guide  the  goodwill  of  the 
institutions  or  people  concern.  If  you‟re  looking  for  online 
experience degrees you should ensure that the institute has 
proper  accreditation.  Fake  degrees  can  destroy;  ruin  your 
academic  and  professional  career.  It  is  important  to  check 
with  the  accrediting  agencies  or  organization  to  know  the 
registered  institute  you  are  about  to  acquire  a  degree 
because  students  at  time  end  up  with  fake  college  degree. 
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes Radio 
Frequency  Identification.  Section  3:  System  Architecture, 
Section  4  Certificate  implementation  Section  5:  Character 
Proximity and solution Statement. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the use of a wireless 
non-contact 
radio-frequency 
electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to 
an  object,  for  the  purposes  of  automatic  identification  and 
tracking.  The  most  important  criterion  of  different  RFID 
systems is how the energy supplies of the transponder works 
which are classified into passive and active transponders.

Passive  transponders  do  not  have  any  power  supply  while 
the Active transponders have their own energy supply, e.g. in 
form  of  a  battery  or  a  solar  cell.  Here  the  power  supply  is 
used  to  provide  voltage  to  the  chip.  The  magnetic  or 
electromagnetic  field  received  by  the  reader  is  therefore  no 
longer necessary for the  power  supply  of  the  chip  (Kleist  et 
al., 2004) and (Rikcha, 2004). RFID systems rely on external 
communication  channels  link  in  which  data  is  registered  by 
the reader to other data pools. Security issues regarding the 
back-end  of  the  RFID  system  are  not  specific  but  the  RFID 
systems  rely  on  that  external  communication  channels  link 
registered  by  the  reader  to  other  data  pools.  There  are 
different  complex  procedures  for  storing  information  on 
transponders. The cloning of transponders can be efficiently 
prevented  by  using  authentication  and  encrypted  data 
transmission  according 
(Westhues,  2005).  The 
interception  of  the  communication  between  reader  and 
transponder is therefore one of the most prominent threats to 
RFID  technology.  The  ranges  given  for  RFID  systems  vary 
between a few centimetres (e.g. ISO/IEC 14443, 13.56 MHz) 
and  several  metres  (ISO/IEC  18000-6,  868  MHz)  and  apply 
to 
the 
transponder  to  be  supplied  with  power  and  to  generate 
several volts at the antenna. For the identification of vehicles, 
the required range of the RFID system is designed such that, 
at the maximum vehicle speed, the length of time spent in the 
interrogation  zone  is  sufficient  for  the  transmission  of  the 
required data as reported in (Bachthaler, 1997).  
 
3. Materials and Methods 
The proposed system is made up of system architecture that 
includes:  design  structure,  behavior  of  a  computer  system, 
microprocessor,  system  program  and  the  characteristics  of 
individual  components  and  how  they  interact.  In  order  to 
show the design, structure, physical elements, behaviour and 
individual components of the proposed system, three unique 
unified  modeling  tools  were  used.  These  are  Package 
diagram, Component diagram and Deployment diagram. The 
package  diagram  provides  a  way  to  group  related  elements 
and  to  scope  their  names;  it  also  provides  a  way  of 
visualizing  dependencies  between  parts  of  the  system.  The

package diagram for the proposed system below in figure 1 
shows a three-layered architecture, consisting of a Certificate 
Application  package,  an  Administrative  package,  and  an 
RFID  Security  package.  The  packages  represent  different 
generic  subsystems  of  the  proposed  system.  The  dashed 
arrows  represent  the  dependencies  among  the  packages. 
The packages participate in a client-supplier relationship 
 

Figure 1. Package Diagram 

 
A component is an encapsulated, reusable, and replaceable 
part of your software; it is a physical piece of a system, such 
as a compiled object file, piece of source code, shared library 
or Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). Component diagrams model 
the  physical  software  components  and  the  relationships 
between  them,  show  the  structure  of  the  code  itself,  model 
source  code  and  relationships  between  files,  model  the 
structure  of  software  releases  and  specify  files  that  are 
compiled into an executable.

The  information  on  this  certificate  is  secured  and  protected 
from forgery and whenever the certificate is within the reader 
reading coverage area, the tag is detected and the encrypted 
file is read.  
 
4. Certificate Implementation 
The  deployment  diagram  of  the  implementation  for  the 
proposed  system  shows 
in 
client/server  architecture,  the  deployment  of  the  Certificate 
Application component to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
server, 
the  Administrator  Operator 
component to a high-end University server and the Graphical 
User  Interface  (GUI)  components  to  client/administrator 
workstations.  During  the  implementation  the  following  were 
considered and deduced. 
a.  The  nodes 

topology  of  nodes

in 

the  deployment  diagram  below  are 
connected  using  a  TCP/IP  Local  Area  Network  (LAN) 
the  GraduateInterface  component,  a 
cable.  From 
graduate  can  access 
the  Certificate  Application 
component  on  his/her  personal  computer  using  the 
ICertificatePortal  interface.  The  Certificate  Application 
component  requires  the  GraduateInfoDB  database  to 
store  and  retrieve  data  used  during  the  certificate 
application  process.  This  database  is  maintained  in  the 
ISP server.  

b.  Alternatively, from the AdministratorInterface component, 
an  administrator  can  access  the  Administrator  Operator 
component  on  his/her  personal  computer  using  the 
IAdminPortal interface in figure 3. 

 

Fig 3: Deployment Diagram 

 

In the component diagram for the proposed system, several 
software  components  have  been  identified.  For  example, 
RFID Smart Certificate Administration, Graduate Application, 
Facilities,  Graduate,  Certificate,  Application.  A  deployment 
diagram shows the structure of the run-time system, capture 
the hardware that will be used to implement the system and 
the  links between different items of hardware. It  models  the 
physical  hardware  elements  and  the  communication  paths 
between them. Ultimately, a deployment  diagram shows the 
system‟s  hardware,  the  software  installed  on  that  hardware, 
and  the  middleware  that  connects  the  disparate  machines 
together.  
 
A  microchip  Student  Graduation  Certificate:  The  tag 
was use to established electromagnetic field to communicate 
with  the  Reader.  The  tags  was  programmed  with  the 
encrypted  version  of  each  graduate‟s  certificate  details 
before it is being appended onto the certificates to be issued. 

 
The  Graduate-user  part  is  a  module  in  the  implementation 
which  is  made  up  of  a  web-based  application  that  can  be 
deployed  on  a  network  for  easy  access  to  graduates  given 
the  correct  username  and  password.  Forms  are  used  to 
accept  data  from  the  graduates.  Forms  to  be  filled  by  the 
graduate  include  Bio-data  Information  Form  and  Clearance 
Information Form. The Supervisor-user part of the  proposed 
system  is  also  a  web-based  application  that  can  also  be 
deployed on a network to grant easy access to all clearance 
supervisors  given  the  correct  username  and  password. 
Supervisors are not expected to fill any form; they are only to 
indicate  if  a  graduate  has  been  cleared  from  his/her  own 
jurisdiction. The Administrator‟s part of the proposed system 
is solely a Java GUI application which will serve as a back-
end for monitoring the entire system – adding new, updating 
existing,  deleting  old,  and  viewing  graduates‟  and 
supervisors‟  details  –  as  well  as  creating  certificates  for 
cleared  graduates,  encrypting  and  decrypting  the  certificate 
information. The Administrator‟s part is a C-sharp application

for  encoding  and  decoding  encrypted  data  on  RFID  tags 
using  the  RFID  reader  (reason  being  that  the  RFID  being 
used for this project supports C-sharp NOT Java). The major 
output of the proposed system is the RFID Smart Graduation 
Certificate. The proposed system also maintains a log of all 
operations  performed  and  by  whom.  However,  Reports 
concerning all activities which took place in generating such 
certificates has to  be  noted  and  presented  to  the  University 
Management  in  form  of  reports  to  aid  decision-making. 
Activity  Diagrams  of  the  implementation  describe  events 
needed  to  achieve  some  operation,  particularly  where  the 
operation is intended to achieve a number of different things 
that require coordination. They also describe how the events 
in a single use case relate to one another; in particular, use 
cases where activities may overlap and require coordination, 
i.e.  how  a  collection  of  use  cases  coordinate  to  create  a 
workflow for an organization as shown in figure 4.

5. Character Proximity and Solution Statement 
The design and development of character proximity scheme 
in  the  database  of  type  B  radio  frequency  identification  tag 
was  used  to  identify  the  originality  layout  in  the  database. 
During  implementation,  two  or  more  separately  matching 
term  occurrences  were  within  a  specified  distance,  where 
distance is the  number of intermediate  words or characters. 
In  the  proposed  system,  every  statement  is  executed  given 
the  right  condition  and  test  data.  For  example,  a  program 
statement that creates certificate would not be executed if an 
administrator  does  not  attempt  to  create  a  certificate  for  a 
graduate.  During  statement  testing,  program  statements 
under the  following  headings  were  tested  and  are  executed 
every  time  given  the  right  condition  and  test  data:  Add  new 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor  record,    Update 
existing administrator, graduate, or supervisor record,  Delete 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor 
  View 
administrator,  Graduate,  or  Supervisor  record,    Certificate 
Application  and  Graduate  Verification,    Certificate  Creation, 
Encryption  and  Decryption,    RFID  tag  writing  and  reading,  
Report Generation. The Taxonomy of people within the said 
university includes:  male or female that form the gender, the 
type of degree which can be undergraduate or postgraduate 
who  are  student.  Employer  can  be  administrator  and 
supervisor,  the  supervisor  can  be  associate  supervisor  or 
tenured  supervisor.  Nationalism  are  mainly  the  citizen  or 
foreigner. To give the important conceptual/domain modeling 
an indicator was introduced as shown in table 1 below.

composed,  accessed,  secured  and  reviewed  because  the 
original  data  must  be  encrypted.  The  certificate  template 
must be created for encryption and decryption to be secured 
and  accessed  by  the  RFID  reader,  which  are  reviewed  and 
verified.  However  other  indicator  and  their  meaning  served 
the  purposes  of  modeling  the  software  and  hardware.  Each 
process  may  consist  of  several  sub-processes.  Each  sub-
process  may  also  be  broken  down  into  smaller  units. 
Decomposition  continues  until  no  sub-process  can  logically 
be  broken  down  any  further.  The  clearance  levels  was 
intended to restrict the amount of access each administrator 
has  on  the  system‟s  data.  This  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of 
external  influence  or  forgery.  The  table  2  below  shows  the 
clearance levels of the developed system.

has  complete  access  to  other  administrators‟  details;  he 
can add new, update existing or delete old administrator‟s 
record.  He/she  can  also  generate  systems  report  on 
administrators.

The  report  menu  of  the  administrative  homepage  contains 
report  generation  operations  that  can  be  performed  by 
administrators. An administrator, depending on his clearance 
level,  can  generate  systems  report  on  administrators, 
graduates,  supervisors,  certificates  and  RFID  tags.  These 
reports  enable  the  management  to  make  decisions  as 
regards the overall function of the system 
 
6. Result and Discussion 
Six  important  tests  were  carried  out  in  the  course  of 
implementation  and  deployment.  They  include  Statement 
Testing,  Branch  Testing,  Expression  Testing,  Path  Testing, 
Black-Box Test, and White-Box Test. During Statement Test, 
every statement is executed given the right condition and test 
data. For the  Branch Test a  probes  was  inserted  at  various 
branch  points  in  the  program  to  ensure  that  every  branch 
gets  executed  under  the  right  condition  such  as  Certificate 
Application,  Graduate  Verification  and  Administrative 
Operations.  The  Expression  Test 
that  every 
expression assumes a variety of valued in such a way that no 
expression can be replaced by a simpler expression and still 
pass  the  test.  In  the  Path  Testing,  data  was  selected  to 
ensure that all paths of the program have been executed. It is 
important  to  draw  a  conclusion  that  about  75%  path  was 
covered  during  unit  and  integration  testing.  The  black  box 
test involves viewing the test object from the  outside whose 
contents  are  unknown.  It  feeds  input  to  the  black  box  and 
notes  what  the  output  is.  The  test‟s  goal  is  to  be  sure  that 
every kind of input is submitted, and that the output observed 
matches the  output expected.  The major kind of input to be 
submitted  to  the  system  is  the  graduate‟s  matriculation 
number and clearance date. The tables below show the black 
box  test  experiment  on  both  the  matriculation  number  and 
clearance date

The  white  box  test  involves  examining  the  code‟s  internal 
logic,  using  a  careful  testing  strategy.  For  example,  we  can 
devise  test  cases  that  execute  all  the  statements  or  all  the 
control paths with the component(s) to be sure the test object 
is working properly. However, it is important to note that it is

In  order  to  curb  the  problem  of  certificate  forgery  this 
research attempted to build a software tool that would protect 
the  integrity  of  graduating  certificate  by  embedding  an 
encoded  RFID  tag  to  each  certificate  before  it  is  being 
issued.  This  project  delivers  an  efficient  RFID  based  Smart

eradicate, the problem of forgery and fraudulent activities on 
certificates.  The  smart  certificates  will  include  all  vital 
university certificate information, encoded and stored onto an 
RFID  label  attached  to  the  certificate.  This  information  can 
then  be  read  and  instantly  verified  by  any  authorized 
government body / representatives. It is of immense benefits 
to universities as it protects and secures the integrity of their 
graduation  certificate,  reduces  administrative  work,  and 
improves graduate‟s creditability ratios.
