The radio frequency identification (RFID)

[5] and
wireless sensing technologies have emerged in the recent
years, and various applications have been developed to
utilize the advantages of these new technologies. With
enough radio­frequency bandwidths defined and released,
as well as the diversified data communication protocols
developed, the wireless sensing has become an applicable
technology. Different protocols have occupied different
bandwidths and developed specific architectures of data
communication. For examples, IEEE802.11x has taken the
2.4GHz for Wireless Ethernet and been adopted for internet
communication [6], IEEE802.15.4 has been defined for the
Zigbee which is a short range, low power and low data rate
data communication protocol at different
frequency in
different countries [7], the popular GSM/CDMA mobile
phone networks can also be adopted for long range data
communication [8], etc. All these development of wireless
communication protocols have provided platforms of
wireless sensing to transmit signals of specific sensors to
the master devices in which all the collected data can be
processed in large scale at higher efficiency. These wireless
technologies have minimized the capital of the wiring at the
working sites and simplify the installation of sensing
network. Since the wireless radio frequency electromagnetic
wave is a format of energy transmitted among devices,
standards are also defined to assure the health and safety of
human and devices exposed at the working sites, such as
the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands [9].

time and amount of consumption, storage of the monitored
chemicals. Basically these can all be related to the
inventory records of the chemicals. The RFID technology
has been widely accepted in the industry for logistics to
reduce the human interference and automate the processes
[10­11]. The concept of RFID technology is to use a tag
reader actively transmit radio wave at a specific frequency.
And this specific radio wave can be absorbed by the
specially designed antenna on the tag to energize the circuit
on the tag and transmit data on the tag back to the reader.
In this structure, the tag is a passive device which can only
provide information when a tag reader approaches and
provides energy at a designed frequency. In most RFID
application,
the tags contain only limited permanent
information of the items attached, such as identification
(numbers), and others. However, once the identification is
detected, it can be sent to the central devices and retrieve
more related information from servers. In more advanced
applications, the information on the tag can be renewed to
keep some information updated. The RFID applications are

can only provide the existence of the container but not the
actual amount inside the container. This shortage has kept
the RFID technology from the inventory control of the
liquid, powder, or small pieces sold in volume. The typical
operations of chemical laboratories can be categorized in
these RFID non­applicable fields, in which chemicals are

less. Moreover,
the hazardous waste in the chemical
laboratories, if need to be monitored, increases little by little,

The radio frequency identification (RFID)

[5] and
wireless sensing technologies have emerged in the recent
years, and various applications have been developed to
utilize the advantages of these new technologies. With
enough radio­frequency bandwidths defined and released,
as well as the diversified data communication protocols
developed, the wireless sensing has become an applicable
technology. Different protocols have occupied different
bandwidths and developed specific architectures of data
communication. For examples, IEEE802.11x has taken the
2.4GHz for Wireless Ethernet and been adopted for internet
communication [6], IEEE802.15.4 has been defined for the
Zigbee which is a short range, low power and low data rate
data communication protocol at different
frequency in
different countries [7], the popular GSM/CDMA mobile
phone networks can also be adopted for long range data
communication [8], etc. All these development of wireless
communication protocols have provided platforms of
wireless sensing to transmit signals of specific sensors to
the master devices in which all the collected data can be
processed in large scale at higher efficiency. These wireless
technologies have minimized the capital of the wiring at the
working sites and simplify the installation of sensing
network. Since the wireless radio frequency electromagnetic
wave is a format of energy transmitted among devices,
standards are also defined to assure the health and safety of
human and devices exposed at the working sites, such as
the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands [9].
the hazardous

usage of these chemicals, including the type, import, export,

time and amount of consumption, storage of the monitored
chemicals. Basically these can all be related to the
inventory records of the chemicals. The RFID technology
has been widely accepted in the industry for logistics to
reduce the human interference and automate the processes
[10­11]. The concept of RFID technology is to use a tag
reader actively transmit radio wave at a specific frequency.
And this specific radio wave can be absorbed by the
specially designed antenna on the tag to energize the circuit
on the tag and transmit data on the tag back to the reader.
In this structure, the tag is a passive device which can only
provide information when a tag reader approaches and
provides energy at a designed frequency. In most RFID
application,
the tags contain only limited permanent
information of the items attached, such as identification
(numbers), and others. However, once the identification is
detected, it can be sent to the central devices and retrieve
more related information from servers. In more advanced
applications, the information on the tag can be renewed to
keep some information updated. The RFID applications are
not limited to the industrial logistics but can also be found

the
convenience and efficiency of the inventory control system,
and indeed automated the processes, the information in the
tag is adhesive to the containers of monitored items. Thus
most applications of the RFID are developed to monitor the
inventory in the units of the containers, such as box, bottle,
barrel,
the
abovementioned units might be acceptable in the mass­
production industry, but it would be a severe problem in
some other businesses which consume some expensive,
precious or hazardous materials in little amount,
for
example, the chemical laboratories. If applied, the RFID tag
can only provide the existence of the container but not the
actual amount inside the container. This shortage has kept
the RFID technology from the inventory control of the
liquid, powder, or small pieces sold in volume. The typical
operations of chemical laboratories can be categorized in
these RFID non­applicable fields, in which chemicals are
taken in the amount of gram, milligram, milliliter or even
less. Moreover,
the hazardous waste in the chemical
laboratories, if need to be monitored, increases little by little,
which could also cause lethal damage to the environment
and human lives if disposed or exposed improperly. Even
though regulations in different countries have forced the
administration of chemical laboratories to maintain proper
inventory records, the effectiveness heavily depends on the

chemicals
developed RFID and wireless
system can
automatically update the inventory of monitored chemicals
periodically or respond the server’s request instantly to check
the usage and storage of the chemicals so that ignorance or
misconduct of
laboratory operators can be prevented or
detected shortly to assure the safety of environment. Unlike
the traditional RFID inventory control system, even the little
quantity change in the chemical container can be detected and
recorded to enhance the inventory control with the innovation
of this system. This automatic system can be deployed and
transmit data wirelessly in laboratories to minimize the cost
and complexity of implementation. It also can communicate
with the remote GHS­based management server via internet
such that administration can oversee the status quo of
inventory of all chemicals in the laboratories with this system
installed. The implementation of this system has shown its
effectiveness to improve the safety and accuracy of inventory
control of the toxic chemicals on campus.

I. INTRODUCTION

The usage of chemicals is diversified and popular in all
fields of industry. It is not a surprise that accidents about
mishandling of chemicals happen frequently which usually
cause loss of lives and health of labors. From governments
to the laboratories, the safety of hazardous chemicals is
always a first­priority issue in the management system.

Originally proposed by the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED) and Inter­
governmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) in the year
of 1992,
the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of
Classification and Labeling of Chemicals is supported by
the International Labor Organization and Economic Co­
operation and Development
to set a global
standard for classification and labeling information of
chemicals around the world [1]. Currently, different
countries have various classifications and labeling systems
of hazardous chemicals which will be a potential safety

(OECD)

issue if these chemicals are transported to other countries
without correct re­labeling [2]. If not handled properly, the
transportation could delay the transactions and activities of
the chemical and cause the loss of time and resources of the
economy [3].

The GHS system is not only aiming at harmonization of
classifications and labeling across the borders, but also
designed to provide thorough information of the hazardous
chemicals to assure the safety at the stages of transportation,
handling, storage, disposal and etc. As there are thousands
of hazardous chemicals and wastes, a computerized
platform is a necessity to adopt the GHS system. A GHS­
based
system of hazardous
chemicals has been developed and deployed on the author’s
campus which can administrate import and export of these
track education training records, update the
chemical,
inventory, monitor
the laboratory safety, and provide
emergency response information [4].

intelligent management

In most of the chemical laboratories, traditional book­
keeping is common for monitoring the usage of toxic
chemicals for its simplicity. To avoid ignorant or unlearned
behaviors and to facilitate the operations, some electronic
devices are integrated to minimize human mistakes. For
example, a Laboratory Information System for Chemicals
(LISC) system is implemented using an electronic scale and
the bar­code reader to assist the operator input the data with
minimum efforts and mistakes. In spite of computerized
processes and the efficiency improved by the electronic
devices, the LISC system still needs human interactions to
collect
the monitored chemicals. To
automate the procedures, an intelligent device which can
actively measure and collect
the usage of hazardous
chemicals is needed in the management system.

information of

Although the currently deployed management system is
these
capable of handling complicate information of
specific hazardous chemicals,
relies heavily on the
operators’ data entries and working patterns to keep the
management system up­to­date. Once any of the operators
breaks the information loops by ignorance or misconduct,
the system functions and efficiency will be damaged or
broken down. Even well­disciplined operators may be

it

negligent to keep all the records promptly and correctly, not
to mention the naïve trainees in the laboratories. To assure
the thoroughness of
information paths, an automatic
management device of hazardous chemicals must be
incorporated in the system as shown in the Figure 1. The
need of automation motivated this study to develop an
automatically monitoring and measuring device to improve
the current deployed system.

The system can also warn the worker for missing

Inappropriate log­off will be identified by the system and
correcting action should be filed and reviewed by the
administration. Changes of
the toxic waste are also
monitored and can be analyzed with respect to the usage of
chemicals. Therefore, unreasonable disposal of the toxic
waste can also be identified to protect the organization from
workers’ ignorance or misconduct of illegal disposals.
IV.IMPLEMENTATION

When the developed system is deployed in the
laboratories on campus, for the different needs of operations,
the system is programmed in two modes,

A. Single Device, i.e. One Master device only, and
B. Multiple Devices, i.e. Master & Multiple Slaves.
For laboratories which do not have hazardous chemicals,
only one Master device is installed so that operators can
renew the inventory of chemicals at a required period. To
update the information, operators simply open the computer
program and put the container of chemicals on the platform
of the device, as shown in Figure 10, the weight, RFID tag

For those laboratories which have toxic or hazardous
chemicals need to be monitored all the time, the multiple
device system is implemented to assure the safety around
the clock. Each subsystem in a laboratory consists of one
master device and 4 slave ones, as shown in Figure 11. To
accommodate the future expansion,
the database and
wireless protocol are designed to take up to 65536 slave
machines. Each slave device is also designated a machine
ID so that the management system can track its location.
The system can read the RFID tag number without
interference

temperature, and sense the current weight of the chemical
within the designed range with resolution of 0.1 gram. The
wireless communication has been tested for its durability
and stability, which is capable of delivering data within 50
meters for weeks without interruption. The scanning time
for 1000 slave devices is less than 200 seconds. The

Abstract—A RFID and wireless sensing network have been
developed to improve a GHS­based intelligent management
platform deployed on campus, which monitors the hazardous
laboratories. The
chemicals
developed RFID and wireless
system can
automatically update the inventory of monitored chemicals
periodically or respond the server’s request instantly to check
the usage and storage of the chemicals so that ignorance or
misconduct of
laboratory operators can be prevented or
detected shortly to assure the safety of environment. Unlike
the traditional RFID inventory control system, even the little
quantity change in the chemical container can be detected and
recorded to enhance the inventory control with the innovation
of this system. This automatic system can be deployed and
transmit data wirelessly in laboratories to minimize the cost
and complexity of implementation. It also can communicate
with the remote GHS­based management server via internet
such that administration can oversee the status quo of
inventory of all chemicals in the laboratories with this system
installed. The implementation of this system has shown its
effectiveness to improve the safety and accuracy of inventory
control of the toxic chemicals on campus.

I. INTRODUCTION

The usage of chemicals is diversified and popular in all
fields of industry. It is not a surprise that accidents about
mishandling of chemicals happen frequently which usually
cause loss of lives and health of labors. From governments
to the laboratories, the safety of hazardous chemicals is
always a first­priority issue in the management system.

Originally proposed by the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED) and Inter­
governmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) in the year
of 1992,
the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of
Classification and Labeling of Chemicals is supported by
the International Labor Organization and Economic Co­
operation and Development
to set a global
standard for classification and labeling information of
chemicals around the world [1]. Currently, different
countries have various classifications and labeling systems
of hazardous chemicals which will be a potential safety

(OECD)

issue if these chemicals are transported to other countries
without correct re­labeling [2]. If not handled properly, the
transportation could delay the transactions and activities of
the chemical and cause the loss of time and resources of the
economy [3].

The GHS system is not only aiming at harmonization of
classifications and labeling across the borders, but also
designed to provide thorough information of the hazardous
chemicals to assure the safety at the stages of transportation,
handling, storage, disposal and etc. As there are thousands
of hazardous chemicals and wastes, a computerized
platform is a necessity to adopt the GHS system. A GHS­
based
system of hazardous
chemicals has been developed and deployed on the author’s
campus which can administrate import and export of these
track education training records, update the
chemical,
inventory, monitor
the laboratory safety, and provide
emergency response information [4].

intelligent management

In most of the chemical laboratories, traditional book­
keeping is common for monitoring the usage of toxic
chemicals for its simplicity. To avoid ignorant or unlearned
behaviors and to facilitate the operations, some electronic
devices are integrated to minimize human mistakes. For
example, a Laboratory Information System for Chemicals
(LISC) system is implemented using an electronic scale and
the bar­code reader to assist the operator input the data with
minimum efforts and mistakes. In spite of computerized
processes and the efficiency improved by the electronic
devices, the LISC system still needs human interactions to
collect
the monitored chemicals. To
automate the procedures, an intelligent device which can
actively measure and collect
the usage of hazardous
chemicals is needed in the management system.

information of

Although the currently deployed management system is
these
capable of handling complicate information of
specific hazardous chemicals,
relies heavily on the
operators’ data entries and working patterns to keep the
management system up­to­date. Once any of the operators
breaks the information loops by ignorance or misconduct,
the system functions and efficiency will be damaged or
broken down. Even well­disciplined operators may be

negligent to keep all the records promptly and correctly, not
to mention the naïve trainees in the laboratories. To assure
the thoroughness of
information paths, an automatic
management device of hazardous chemicals must be
incorporated in the system as shown in the Figure 1. The
need of automation motivated this study to develop an
automatically monitoring and measuring device to improve
the current deployed system.

the current deployed GHS­based chemicals management system

The radio frequency identification (RFID)

[5] and
wireless sensing technologies have emerged in the recent
years, and various applications have been developed to
utilize the advantages of these new technologies. With
enough radio­frequency bandwidths defined and released,
as well as the diversified data communication protocols
developed, the wireless sensing has become an applicable
technology. Different protocols have occupied different
bandwidths and developed specific architectures of data
communication. For examples, IEEE802.11x has taken the
2.4GHz for Wireless Ethernet and been adopted for internet
communication [6], IEEE802.15.4 has been defined for the
Zigbee which is a short range, low power and low data rate
data communication protocol at different
frequency in
different countries [7], the popular GSM/CDMA mobile
phone networks can also be adopted for long range data
communication [8], etc. All these development of wireless
communication protocols have provided platforms of
wireless sensing to transmit signals of specific sensors to
the master devices in which all the collected data can be
processed in large scale at higher efficiency. These wireless
technologies have minimized the capital of the wiring at the
working sites and simplify the installation of sensing
network. Since the wireless radio frequency electromagnetic
wave is a format of energy transmitted among devices,
standards are also defined to assure the health and safety of
human and devices exposed at the working sites, such as
the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands [9].
the hazardous
chemicals management system is the transportation and
usage of these chemicals, including the type, import, export,

time and amount of consumption, storage of the monitored
chemicals. Basically these can all be related to the
inventory records of the chemicals. The RFID technology
has been widely accepted in the industry for logistics to
reduce the human interference and automate the processes
[10­11]. The concept of RFID technology is to use a tag
reader actively transmit radio wave at a specific frequency.
And this specific radio wave can be absorbed by the
specially designed antenna on the tag to energize the circuit
on the tag and transmit data on the tag back to the reader.
In this structure, the tag is a passive device which can only
provide information when a tag reader approaches and
provides energy at a designed frequency. In most RFID
application,
the tags contain only limited permanent
information of the items attached, such as identification
(numbers), and others. However, once the identification is
detected, it can be sent to the central devices and retrieve
more related information from servers. In more advanced
applications, the information on the tag can be renewed to
keep some information updated. The RFID applications are
not limited to the industrial logistics but can also be found
in

the
convenience and efficiency of the inventory control system,
and indeed automated the processes, the information in the
tag is adhesive to the containers of monitored items. Thus
most applications of the RFID are developed to monitor the
inventory in the units of the containers, such as box, bottle,
barrel,
the
abovementioned units might be acceptable in the mass­
production industry, but it would be a severe problem in
some other businesses which consume some expensive,
precious or hazardous materials in little amount,
for
example, the chemical laboratories. If applied, the RFID tag
can only provide the existence of the container but not the
actual amount inside the container. This shortage has kept
the RFID technology from the inventory control of the
liquid, powder, or small pieces sold in volume. The typical
operations of chemical laboratories can be categorized in
these RFID non­applicable fields, in which chemicals are
taken in the amount of gram, milligram, milliliter or even
less. Moreover,
the hazardous waste in the chemical
laboratories, if need to be monitored, increases little by little,
which could also cause lethal damage to the environment
and human lives if disposed or exposed improperly. Even
though regulations in different countries have forced the
administration of chemical laboratories to maintain proper
inventory records, the effectiveness heavily depends on the
operators’

effectiveness and safety. Herein, an automatic inventory

To eliminate the improper events of workers and shorten
the response time of accidents, automatic sensing devices
are therefore needed to improve the accuracy of inventory
control of toxic chemicals. To better the monitoring of toxic
chemicals, the devices should be designed to work around
the clock to assure the safety of the chemicals. Considering
the different storage requirements of chemicals and waste
in a laboratory, the wireless sensing technique is chosen to
facilitate the implementation of
the automatic sensing
device. However, wired option should also be reserved for

systems are identification and usage. Other than the human
operations,
the best candidates are RFID and Image
Recognition technologies. Image recognition was originally
designed to utilize the IP cameras installed in the first
phase of this GHS­based system, but soon it was found
infeasible to identify the chemicals among other similar
items [12]. Because the resolutions of image taken by the IP

camera, it is still rendered impossible to identify the labels
or bar codes on the chemical bottles, not to mention the tiny
alphabets on the label. This approach also requires all the
bottles positioned with proper orientation to enhance the
image. Otherwise, the captured image could be redeemed
useless. This neatness is not easy to maintain without harsh
training. To make it worse is that the labels have to be
aligned with the camera line­of­sight to obtain the whole
image which still comes with distortion because of the
shape of the bottle. Even if all the physical problems can be
overcome, the accuracy of image recognition may come
with a tolerance.

WIRELESSSENSINGDEVICES

To realize the concept discussed, the design of this
sensing device must consider the industrial standards for
radio frequency as well as the requirements of the GHS­
based intelligent management system.

At the system level, a master device is designed as an
interface or bridge between the laboratory computer
/administration server and all the slave sensing devices.
With the wireless communication protocol,
the master
device can collect
information from all slave devices
located at different sites in a laboratory. Each slave device
has equipped an ISO15693 standard RFID reader, a load
cell with measuring range of 500 grams or 5 Kilograms for
monitoring chemicals or waste respectively, a temperature
sensor, a LCD display, LEDs, a buzzer, a ISM standard
wireless communication module, and an ARM­7 processor
to handle all the required operations in the slave device.
The structure and prototype of the slave device is shown in
Figure 4 and 5. With the above modules, the slave device
can obtain the identifications, weight, and surrounding
temperature of the chemicals and waste. The workflow of a
slave device
shown in Figure 6. The collected
information can be displayed locally on the LCD display
and/or transmitted to the master device wirelessly. Sound or
light warning can be asserted by the buzzer or LEDs locally
to alert the worker for possible mistakes or misconducts.

or disposed. Depending on the machine connected,
the
master device can equipped with Ethernet, UART, or CAN
bus module for communication. With the Ethernet, or CAN
bus communication protocols,
the master device can
communicate with thousands of slave devices in the systems
and thus provides the management system access to
monitor numerous hazardous chemicals in the laboratory
on site or remotely via internet. With proper setting of these
devices, the system can also serve as a security system of
hazardous chemicals for better safety assurance of the
organization. Implementation of a master device connected
to a laboratory computer is shown in Figure 7. And testing
information displayed on the screen is shown in Figure 8.
The workflow of the master device is shown in Figure 9.

With aid of the automatic devices, the operations of SOP
subsystem can be dramatically simplified. Without proper

user log­in approved by the system, any movement or
change of monitored chemicals will be recorded and
alarmed to the management right away. Report should be
filed and reviewed to correct this misbehavior. In case of
any warning caused by accidents or misdemeanors, the
system can respond right away to prevent or lessen the
possible damages and can also provide the handling
information of
related chemicals automatically on the
intelligent e­platform. With authorized log­in, the worker
does not have to enter
the chemicals
individually since the system can automatically identify all
the chemicals taken from their storage spots. At
the
worker’s log­off, the intelligent system will summarize all
the properly restored chemicals for worker’s verification.

The system can also warn the worker for missing
chemicals, if any, to search and secure the missing ones.

Inappropriate log­off will be identified by the system and
correcting action should be filed and reviewed by the
administration. Changes of
the toxic waste are also
monitored and can be analyzed with respect to the usage of
chemicals. Therefore, unreasonable disposal of the toxic
waste can also be identified to protect the organization from
workers’ ignorance or misconduct of illegal disposals.
IV.IMPLEMENTATION

When the developed system is deployed in the
laboratories on campus, for the different needs of operations,
the system is programmed in two modes,

A. Single Device, i.e. One Master device only, and
B. Multiple Devices, i.e. Master & Multiple Slaves.
For laboratories which do not have hazardous chemicals,
only one Master device is installed so that operators can
renew the inventory of chemicals at a required period. To
update the information, operators simply open the computer
program and put the container of chemicals on the platform
of the device, as shown in Figure 10, the weight, RFID tag

For those laboratories which have toxic or hazardous
chemicals need to be monitored all the time, the multiple
device system is implemented to assure the safety around
the clock. Each subsystem in a laboratory consists of one
master device and 4 slave ones, as shown in Figure 11. To
accommodate the future expansion,
the database and
wireless protocol are designed to take up to 65536 slave
machines. Each slave device is also designated a machine
ID so that the management system can track its location.
The system can read the RFID tag number without

within the designed range with resolution of 0.1 gram. The
wireless communication has been tested for its durability
and stability, which is capable of delivering data within 50
meters for weeks without interruption. The scanning time
for 1000 slave devices is less than 200 seconds. The
measurement data can also be displayed on the slave’s LCD,
where the upper row is the unique RFID tag number with

Because the slave devices are designed to be distributed
arbitrarily in the laboratory, to avoid the nuisance from the
radio wave of other slave devices, the power rate and range
of the RFID readers are adjusted to detect tags within a few
centimeters. As the result, there is no interference observed
when devices are implemented side­by­side. Although
water or liquid has been known to be a factor for RFID tag
reading, the tests in this study show that the applied RFID
reader can successfully identify the tag, which is located at
the bottom of containers.

Fig. 11 Implementation of the multiple device system in the storage cabinet

With a master device connected to a laboratory computer
or an Ethernet adaptor, the polling request can be sent via
the master device wirelessly to the slave ones. To
communicate with the server of administration office at a
remote site via Internet, the master device has equipped
with an extra RS­232 port, such that it can be connected to
the Ethernet adapter. The slave devices will respond with
the monitored chemicals information and collected by the
master device wirelessly, which will be processed and
shown on the local computer periodically to update the
most recent status of monitored hazardous chemicals and
waste. The program interface can display information of
those monitored chemicals for local laboratory review. The
administration office can inquiry any chemical
in any
laboratory at any time and obtain instant response in real­
time. The administrator can check the history of chemicals
inventory from anywhere via a Web­based interface as
shown in Figure 12.

In addition, the temperature sensor integrated can be
used to monitor the storage condition of the chemicals as
well as the potential fire accident. Various sensors can also
be attached to the device upon request
to monitor the

environmental factors, such as humidity, light, etc. The
device can even be connected to the security sensors, such
as proximity or infrared sensors to alarm the management
system if no authorized activities on the critical chemicals
take place. All these information can be transmitted to the
server for monitoring and recording wirelessly and via
internet.
V.CONCLUSIONS

system using RFID and wireless

The developed intelligent wireless chemical inventory
control
sensing
technologies has automated the inventory identification and
measuring processes. With this automatic system, not only
the usage of all the hazardous chemicals can be recorded
without human input, but also the security of them is
monitored all
the time. The developed system has
eliminated the human operations in the inventory system
and can measure the varying quantities of the chemicals in
the container. This system also provides the administration
a real­time accessibility to the inventory control so that the
safety and environment protection of the operating sites can
be assured. The wireless networking also simplifies
complicate implementation and provides
flexibility of
chemical storages.
