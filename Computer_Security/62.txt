I.    INTRODUCTION 

      Security  is  one  of  main  concern  in  today‟s  life,  till  date 
numerous  state  of  art  type  of  technologies  have  been 
implemented for security purposes. Some technologies are not 
widely  used  due  to  cost  factor  and  difficult  implementation. 
For  achieving  the  objective  of  security  purposes,  the  object 
and  person  is  to  be  labeled  and  codified  whenever  there  is 
other redundant  object/person  present  in  the  working  cell  for 
which  security  is  provided.  For  such  technologies  automatic 
identification and data capture is used. 

Automatic  Identification  and  Data  Capture  (AIDC)  refers  to 
the  methods  of  automatically  identifying  objects,  collecting 
data about them, and entering that data directly into computer 
systems  (i.e.  without  human  involvement).  Technologies 
typically considered as part of AIDC include bar codes, Radio 
Frequency  Identification  (RFID)(1),  biometrics,  magnetic 
stripes, smart cards, and recognition. When we think of card 
technologies mainly there are three technologies-Smart cards, 
Magnetic  stripe  and  Barcode.  A  smart  card,  chip  card,  or 
integrated  circuit  card, 
is  any  pocket-sized  card  with 
embedded integrated circuits. Generally integrated circuit chip 
consists  of  microprocessor,  read  only  memory,  RAM  and 
electrically erasable programmable read only memory.

 Magnetic  Stripe  technology  is  one  of  the  most  universal 
methods in Automatic Identification and Data Capture(AIDC) 
industry The technology is embedded in credit cards, ID cards, 
ATM  cards,  security  control  of  selected  rooms  or  buildings, 
time and attendance cards, factory floor data collection cards, 
driver's licenses, mass transits tickets, airline tickets and many 
more. 

Magnetic  stripe  is  basically  a  row  of  tiny  magnets.  The  data 
entered  is  encoded  to  the  media  by  setting  the  polarities  of 
these  magnets.  In  order  to  do  this,  a  reader  must  detect  the 
changes in the polarity in the magnets. 

A  barcode  is  an  optical  machine-readable  representation  of 
data, which shows certain data on certain products. 

Barcodes  can  be  read  by  optical  scanners  called  barcode 
readers, or scanned from an image by special software.

The contact less smart card or RFID technology overcome the 
demerits of bar codes ,dirty or damaged bar code is difficult to 
read also barcodes can store a limited amount of information. 
Barcode must be changed as every time when information are 
modified.  Barcode  and  barcode  reader  require  line  of  sight 
communication.  Another  advantage  of  RFID  system  is  that 
they don‟t require line of sight communication RFID tags can 
be read very quickly. Also the tags can be read in all types of 
environment  such  as  dirt,  ice,  snow,  fog  and  other  harsh 
conditions.

III. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AND IMPLEMENTATION 

 

The  proposed  scheme  is  to  develop  an  intelligent  security 
system using RFID reader and tags to stop entries of unwanted 
persons  in  a  critical  area  where  only  few  persons  are  given 
permission to come inside. For this we are going to use RFID 
reader  and  passive  tags,  microcontroller  8051,  dc  motors,  IR 
sensors.  In  this  system  the  RFID  reader  is  to  be  fixed  to  the 
door  through  which  we  want  to  stop  unauthorized  persons. 
RFID  reader  is  connected  to  microcontroller  which  is 
connected to motors. When a person with valid tag comes  in 
the  range  of  RFID  reader  the  reader  detects  the  tag,  sends 
signal to microcontroller, then the microcontroller turns on the 
motor to open the door. After the person passes through door 
another motor closes the door. 

IV. METHODOLOGY 

RFID  systems  operates  from  very  low  frequency(VLF)  to 
extremely  high  frequency(EHF).RFID  system  operating  in 
low  frequency  range  make  use  of  electromagnetic  wave 
propagation  to  communicate  their  data  and  commands,  these 
use  passive  tags.  RFID  systems  operating  in  low  frequency 
range operates on principle of near field coupling between tag 
and reader. Faraday‟s principle of electromagnetic induction is 
the basis of near field coupling (2). In near field RFID system, 
electromagnetic  waves  are 
reader  or 
interrogator  which  propagates  outwards  with  spherical  wave 
front.  Tags  placed  within  field  collect  some  energy.  Then 
exchange  of  data  between  tag  and  reader  takes  place.  The 
amount of energy available at any particular point is related to

Tag  is  the  basic  building  block  of  RFID.  It  consists 
of  small  silicon  chip  and  an  antenna.  Silicon  chip  is 
used to store the data and antenna is used to energize 
the chip and communicate with reader. 

b)  RFID reader or interrogator 

The RFID reader sends a pulse of radio energy to the 
tag and listens for tag‟s response. The tag detects this 
energy    and  sends  back  a response  that  contains the 
tag‟s  serial  number  and  other  information  as  well

RFID  reader  is  connected  to  microcontroller  which  is 
connected to motors. When a person with valid tag comes  in 
the  range  of  RFID  reader  the  reader  detects  the  tag,  sends 
signal to microcontroller, then the microcontroller turns on the 
motor to open the door. After the person passes through door 
another motor closes the door. 

IV. METHODOLOGY 

RFID  systems  operates  from  very  low  frequency(VLF)  to 
extremely  high  frequency(EHF).RFID  system  operating  in 
low  frequency  range  make  use  of  electromagnetic  wave 
propagation  to  communicate  their  data  and  commands,  these 
use  passive  tags.  RFID  systems  operating  in  low  frequency 
range operates on principle of near field coupling between tag 
and reader. Faraday‟s principle of electromagnetic induction is 
the basis of near field coupling (2). In near field RFID system, 
electromagnetic  waves  are 
reader  or 
interrogator  which  propagates  outwards  with  spherical  wave 
front.  Tags  placed  within  field  collect  some  energy.  Then 
exchange  of  data  between  tag  and  reader  takes  place.  The 
amount of energy available at any particular point is related to 

transmitted  by

Tag  is  the  basic  building  block  of  RFID.  It  consists 
of  small  silicon  chip  and  an  antenna.  Silicon  chip  is 
used to store the data and antenna is used to energize 
the chip and communicate with reader. 

b)  RFID reader or interrogator 

The RFID reader sends a pulse of radio energy to the 
tag and listens for tag‟s response. The tag detects this 
energy    and  sends  back  a response  that  contains the 
tag‟s  serial  number  and  other  information  as  well 
.Implemented  RFID  reader having  frequency  of  125 
KHz for this design .It reads the tags and output their 
information to the microcontroller. 

c)   Power conversion circuits  

Power  conversion  circuits  allow  individual  modules 
to make use of existing power supplies. 

d)  Microcontroller 

 

 

                Microcontroller to be used is AT89C51. 

e)  Relay 

Relay used is of 5V. 
 

       f)     DC motor 

                5V DC motor is used.

I  have  used  here 

Here  RFID  reader  and  passive  tag  are  the  main  components 
used.  Each  passive  tag  has  different  serial  number  stored  in 
chip  inside  the  tag  (3).  The  serial  number  is  given  by 
manufacturer.  We  have  stored  serial  number  information  in 
programming; 
tags. 
Corresponding to each serial number, I have stored names of 
person allowed to enter the room, when they  will place there 
card in field of reader, then door opens and name is displayed 
in  LCD  display.  One  card  is  access  denied.  When  this  card 
will be shown the the door does not open and „entry restricted‟ 
message is displayed in LCD display(4).

VI. CONCLUSION 

Access  security  to  unique  identification  was  achieved  using 
the  RFID  technique.  Proper  identification  was  possible  with 
the help  of  specific  12  character  (8  bit  each)  code  embedded 
in RFID tags. The capture range of  RFID reader was seen to 
be  7  cm  maximum  which  is  very  convenient  in  application 
environment.  Unauthorized  cards  were  rejected  with hundred 
percent accuracy and zero error. The door opening and closing 
arrangement  has  been  successfully  synchronized  with  RFID 
reading  process.  Such  that  door  opens  and  closes  with  high 
degree  of  precision.  Door  opening and  closing  sequence  was 
successfully  mated  with  optical  IR  sensors  to  give  precise 
results. The RFID based entry system could play a vital role in 
providing sensitive environments at low cost.
