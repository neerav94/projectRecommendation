INTRODUCTION 

Hiding sensitive secret text  within personal computers 
(PC) has privilege of the ability to utilize some of the PC 
available  files  to  act  as  the  cover  media.  Interestingly 
choosing  among  personal  images  can  be  assumed  fully 
trusted confidential and only known by the PC user. This 
trust to hide within PC images played as real application 
behind  image  based  steganography  to  secure  sensitive 
text  data.  However,  the  security  of  the  cover  media,  i.e. 
images  on  the  PC,  is  based  on  the  trust  that  the  PC  data 
cannot  be  penetrated  by  any  means,  which  is  difficult  to 
assure and claim that the images are fully safe. This claim 
justified  the  need  to  add  another  security  layer  to  insure 
that  even  for  the  very  difficult  security  penetration;  still 
the  sensitive  data  are  not  harmed  or  used  negatively.  In 
other  words,  securing  the  data  by  steganography  alone 
cannot be justified and completely relayed on, making the 
need  to  add  another  security  layer  [1].  We  in  this  paper, 
present  the  2-layer  security  system  utilizing  image  base 
steganography  as  PC  dependant  layer  as  well  as  AES 
cryptography as independent assurance layer. 

2-layers  security  system,  i.e.  cryptography  layer  and 
steganography layer are the main hiding techniques, used 
to  insure  full  protection  [2]  of  the  sensitive  information 
on  a  PC.  Several  sensitive  text  data  examples  can  be 
expressed  as  clear  application  of  our  proposed  system

hiding  techniques,  is  derived  from  “the  Greek  words 
stegos  meaning  “cover”  and  grafia  meaning  “writing”

general,  uses  any  cover  object  of  media  types,  i.e.  text, 
image,  audio  and  videos,  to  hide  the  secret  data  in  it.

it  PC  dependant),  the  resulted  file  is  known  as  the  stego 
media.  

Cryptography,  as  the  other  layer  within  this  security 
system,  is  PC  independent  and  completely  deferent  than 
steganography.  Cryptography  is  mainly  encrypting  the 
secret plain text converting it to cipher text. Cryptography 
normally  requires  a  secret  key  for  the  encryption/ 
decryption  process  to  secure  the  sensitive  data  from  the 
third party. In our security system, the sensitive text data 
passes through the crypto layer involving a security  key, 
followed by the steganography layer resulting  the output 
file  as  Stego-Image.  Fig.  1  shows  the  main  overview  of 
the method using the two layer techniques [4].

In  this  paper  we  proposed  and  implemented  the  two

using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto  algorithms. 
The  steganography  layer  is  adopting  the  image  based 
steganography  hiding  the  encrypted  data  in  the  least

increasing the LSBs [8]. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section,

sensitive  text  and  observing  the  security  effect  on 
different images observing interesting comparison results.

II.  RELATED WORK 

Several methods are found in the literature suitable for 
PC  security  applications.  Interestingly,  we  are  focusing 
on  the  ones  utilizing  cryptography  and  steganography 
assumed  suitable  for  PC  security  applications.  For 
example,  Vikas  Tyagi  in  [1]  is  describing  a  method  for 
integrating  cryptography  and  steganography  together 
through image processing. The work started by clarifying 
the  way  for encryption of the secret text before hiding  it 
in the image. Then, the encrypted data is to be hidden in 
the  image  through  the  least  significant  bit  (LSB)  image 
based  steganography.  The  paper  did  not  describe  the 
crypto algorithm  used but showed advantage of practical 
implementation  benefits  with  acceptable  security.  The 
research  used  random  size  of  key  that  is  flexible 
according  to  size  of  the  data.  This  made  the  third  party 
disability to predict the size of key and data easily. 

Mehdi  Hussain  presents  image  steganography  LSB 
technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide 
data bits in an image by changing the LSB of each RGB 
image  pixels  color  byte.  The method  described  storing  3 
bits in each pixel by changing LSB bit of the red, green, 
and  blue  color  components,  since  every  color 
is 
represented  by  a  byte.  The  research  showed  real 
advantage  of  using  LSB  to  hide  secret  data  where  the 
change  in  the  pixels  will  have  very  low  effect  and 
unnoticed in observation. 

Domenico  in  [9],  proposed  image  steganography  and 
cryptography system (ISC) for securing data transfer. He 
is  using  images  as  cover  objects  for  steganography  and 
secret  key  for  the  cryptography.  The  performance  of  the 
proposed Image-Based Steganography and Cryptography 
(ISC) system was presented in his work. He compared his 
results  with  another  algorithm  in  the  literature  known  as 
F5  showing  improved  results.  It  was  found  that  the 
comparison  with  F5  is  replacing  the  least-significant  bit 
of  a  DCT  coefficient  with  message  data  which  may  be 
degrading  the  fairness  of  the  analysis.  The  work  in  [9] 
makes  F5  decrements  its  absolute  value  in  a  process 
called  matrix  encoding  claiming  as  a 
theoretically 
unbreakable cryptographic method based on image based 
one-time pad steganography. 

Mohammad in [10] proposed a technique to implement 
steganography and cryptography together to hide the data 
into  an  image  by  two  steps.  The  first  step,  finds  the 
shared stego-key between the two communication parties 
by applying Diffie Hellman Key exchange protocol [10]. 
The  second  step  makes  the  sender  use  the  secret  stego-
key  to  select  pixels  that  will  be  used  to  hide  secret  data. 
Each selected pixel will be used to hide 8 bits of data by 
using  LSB  method.  Although  the  method  showed  real 
interesting security features, it was very complicated with 
high unpractical overhead. 

Harshitha  [11]  proposed  a  security  method  in  which 
the  secret  message  is  first  encrypted  and  then  hidden  in 
cover  file  with  steganography.  The  encryption  of  the 
message is randomly permuted using the secret key. The 
steganography used  was based on the LSB algorithm  for 
both  embedding  and  extraction  process.  All  the  testing 
results  showed  interesting  features  generated  by  Matlab 
experimentations. 

Shailender  Gupta  in  [12]  used  two  crypto  techniques, 
i.e.  Rivest  Shamir  Adleman  (RSA)  algorithm  and  Diffie 
Hellman  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data.  Then  encrypted 
data  is  hidden  using  LSB  steganography  to  insure 
acceptable  security.  The  encrypted  data  as  well  as  the 
image pixels are all considered in their binary form. The 
secret encrypted bits replace the least significant bit (LSB) 
within  every  pixel.  The  presented  results  showed 
comparison  between  using  RSA  and  Diffie  Hellman  as 
crypto methods. Interestingly, it was reported that the use 
of  encryption  in  steganalysis  does  not  affect  the  time 
complexity  when  Diffie  Hellman  algorithm  is  used 
instead of RSA algorithm. 

A  last  explored  method  for  hiding  encrypted  secret 
message  inside  a  cover  file  has  been  introduced  by 
Joyshree  Nath  in  [13].  He  proposed  an  algorithm  for 
encrypting  the  secret  message  with  relation  to  the  work 
proposed in [14]. The work modified the idea of play fair 
method  into  a  new  platform  where  they  can  encrypt  or 
decrypt  any  file.  Their  method  is  dependent  on  the 
random text-key which is to be supplied by the user. They 
introduced  a  new  randomization  method  for  generating 
the  randomized  key  matrix  to  encrypt  plain  text  file  and 
to  decrypt  cipher  text  file.  They  also  introduced  a  new 
algorithm  for  encrypting  the  plain  text  multiple  times 
increasing security by increasing system complexity.

technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide 
data bits in an image by changing the LSB of each RGB 
image  pixels  color  byte.  The method  described  storing  3 
bits in each pixel by changing LSB bit of the red, green, 
and  blue  color  components,  since  every  color 
is 
represented  by  a  byte.  The  research  showed  real 
advantage  of  using  LSB  to  hide  secret  data  where  the 
change  in  the  pixels  will  have  very  low  effect  and 
unnoticed in observation. 

Domenico  in  [9],  proposed  image  steganography  and 
cryptography system (ISC) for securing data transfer. He 
is  using  images  as  cover  objects  for  steganography  and 
secret  key  for  the  cryptography.  The  performance  of  the 
proposed Image-Based Steganography and Cryptography 
(ISC) system was presented in his work. He compared his 
results  with  another  algorithm  in  the  literature  known  as 
F5  showing  improved  results.  It  was  found  that  the 
comparison  with  F5  is  replacing  the  least-significant  bit 
of  a  DCT  coefficient  with  message  data  which  may  be 
degrading  the  fairness  of  the  analysis.  The  work  in  [9] 
makes  F5  decrements  its  absolute  value  in  a  process 
called  matrix  encoding  claiming  as  a 
theoretically 
unbreakable cryptographic method based on image based 
one-time pad steganography. 

Mohammad in [10] proposed a technique to implement 
steganography and cryptography together to hide the data 
into  an  image  by  two  steps.  The  first  step,  finds  the 
shared stego-key between the two communication parties 
by applying Diffie Hellman Key exchange protocol [10]. 
The  second  step  makes  the  sender  use  the  secret  stego-
key  to  select  pixels  that  will  be  used  to  hide  secret  data. 
Each selected pixel will be used to hide 8 bits of data by 
using  LSB  method.  Although  the  method  showed  real 
interesting security features, it was very complicated with 
high unpractical overhead. 

Harshitha  [11]  proposed  a  security  method  in  which 
the  secret  message  is  first  encrypted  and  then  hidden  in 
cover  file  with  steganography.  The  encryption  of  the 
message is randomly permuted using the secret key. The 
steganography used  was based on the LSB algorithm  for 
both  embedding  and  extraction  process.  All  the  testing 
results  showed  interesting  features  generated  by  Matlab 
experimentations. 

Shailender  Gupta  in  [12]  used  two  crypto  techniques, 
i.e.  Rivest  Shamir  Adleman  (RSA)  algorithm  and  Diffie 
Hellman  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data.  Then  encrypted 
data  is  hidden  using  LSB  steganography  to  insure 
acceptable  security.  The  encrypted  data  as  well  as  the 
image pixels are all considered in their binary form. The 
secret encrypted bits replace the least significant bit (LSB) 
within  every  pixel.  The  presented  results  showed 
comparison  between  using  RSA  and  Diffie  Hellman  as 
crypto methods. Interestingly, it was reported that the use 
of  encryption  in  steganalysis  does  not  affect  the  time 
complexity  when  Diffie  Hellman  algorithm  is  used 
instead of RSA algorithm. 

A  last  explored  method  for  hiding  encrypted  secret 
message  inside  a  cover  file  has  been  introduced  by 
Joyshree  Nath  in  [13].  He  proposed  an  algorithm  for 
encrypting  the  secret  message  with  relation  to  the  work 
proposed in [14]. The work modified the idea of play fair 
method  into  a  new  platform  where  they  can  encrypt  or 
decrypt  any  file.  Their  method  is  dependent  on  the 
random text-key which is to be supplied by the user. They 
introduced  a  new  randomization  method  for  generating 
the  randomized  key  matrix  to  encrypt  plain  text  file  and 
to  decrypt  cipher  text  file.  They  also  introduced  a  new 
algorithm  for  encrypting  the  plain  text  multiple  times 
increasing security by increasing system complexity.

we  improved  the  system  capacity  trying  to  increase  the

The main idea used in the image based steganography 
hiding  in  LSBs  can  be  explained  by  an  example  of 
embedding  the  number  200.  When  the  number  200, 
which is 11001000 in binary representation, is embedded 
into the least significant bits of the three pixels as part of 
the image, the resulting grid is as follows:  

Pixel 1: 00101101 
Pixel 2: 10100110   
Pixel 3: 11010010

Notice that the LSB of the last byte of Pixel 3 is not
affected due to the completion of embedding all the secret
bits in the image; so it is kept unchanged.

INTRODUCTION 

Hiding sensitive secret text  within personal computers 
(PC) has privilege of the ability to utilize some of the PC 
available  files  to  act  as  the  cover  media.  Interestingly 
choosing  among  personal  images  can  be  assumed  fully 
trusted confidential and only known by the PC user. This 
trust to hide within PC images played as real application 
behind  image  based  steganography  to  secure  sensitive 
text  data.  However,  the  security  of  the  cover  media,  i.e. 
images  on  the  PC,  is  based  on  the  trust  that  the  PC  data 
cannot  be  penetrated  by  any  means,  which  is  difficult  to 
assure and claim that the images are fully safe. This claim 
justified  the  need  to  add  another  security  layer  to  insure 
that  even  for  the  very  difficult  security  penetration;  still 
the  sensitive  data  are  not  harmed  or  used  negatively.  In 
other  words,  securing  the  data  by  steganography  alone 
cannot be justified and completely relayed on, making the 
need  to  add  another  security  layer  [1].  We  in  this  paper, 
present  the  2-layer  security  system  utilizing  image  base 
steganography  as  PC  dependant  layer  as  well  as  AES 
cryptography as independent assurance layer. 

2-layers  security  system,  i.e.  cryptography  layer  and 
steganography layer are the main hiding techniques, used 
to  insure  full  protection  [2]  of  the  sensitive  information 
on  a  PC.  Several  sensitive  text  data  examples  can  be 
expressed  as  clear  application  of  our  proposed  system 
such  as  e-mail  messages,  credit  card 
information,

corporate  data,  etc.  Steganography,  as  one  of  the  layer’s 
hiding  techniques,  is  derived  from  “the  Greek  words 
stegos  meaning  “cover”  and  grafia  meaning  “writing” 
defining  it  as  covered  writing”  [3].  Steganography,  in 
general,  uses  any  cover  object  of  media  types,  i.e.  text, 
image,  audio  and  videos,  to  hide  the  secret  data  in  it. 
After combining the secret with the cover object (making 
it  PC  dependant),  the  resulted  file  is  known  as  the  stego 
media.  

Cryptography,  as  the  other  layer  within  this  security 
system,  is  PC  independent  and  completely  deferent  than 
steganography.  Cryptography  is  mainly  encrypting  the 
secret plain text converting it to cipher text. Cryptography 
normally  requires  a  secret  key  for  the  encryption/ 
decryption  process  to  secure  the  sensitive  data  from  the 
third party. In our security system, the sensitive text data 
passes through the crypto layer involving a security  key, 
followed by the steganography layer resulting  the output 
file  as  Stego-Image.  Fig.  1  shows  the  main  overview  of 
the method using the two layer techniques [4].

completely  different  [5].  In  steganography,  the  sensitive 
text message is there, but nobody notices it or even aware 
that  it  exist  [6].  However,  once  noticed,  it  can  be  read. 
Cryptography,  on  the  other  hand,  is  secret  writing. 
Anybody  can  see  the  encrypted  sensitive  message,  but

crypto-methods  works  on  the  sensitive  text  letters  to  be 
re-arranged, or replaced by different letters, according to 
the  specific  scheme  triggered  by  a  secret  key,  that  only 
the sender and receiver are familiar with [7]. 

In  this  paper  we  proposed  and  implemented  the  two 
layers technique, i.e. cryptography and steganography, to 
benefit  from  both  and  give  the  best  possible  security 
dedicated for PC applications . The cryptography layer is 
using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto  algorithms. 
The  steganography  layer  is  adopting  the  image  based 
steganography  hiding  the  encrypted  data  in  the  least 
significant  bit  (LSB)  and  trying  to  improve  it  by 
increasing the LSBs [8]. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section, 
Section  2,  will  give  a  background  on  related  work  or 
similar  ideas  where  we  are  describing  several  methods 
utilizing  image  steganography  with  cryptography  to 
secure  information  that  are  found  suitable  for  PC  data 
hiding.  Section  3  presents  our  proposed  2-layer  security 
system  design  and  modeling  issues,  followed  by  a  brief 
explanation of the implementation in Section 4. Section 5 
gives  a  briefing  of  possible  improvement  in  the  capacity 
found suitable in the system stego layer to adopt 2LSB as 
well as 1LSB. Simple studies relating the security of the 
system  and  data  dependency  are  presented  in  Section  6. 
We show different scenarios of fixing/changing the secret 
sensitive  text  and  observing  the  security  effect  on 
different images observing interesting comparison results. 
Section  7  summarizes  the  work  in  the  conclusion  giving 
some ideas of related possible future work. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

Several methods are found in the literature suitable for 
PC  security  applications.  Interestingly,  we  are  focusing 
on  the  ones  utilizing  cryptography  and  steganography 
assumed  suitable  for  PC  security  applications.  For 
example,  Vikas  Tyagi  in  [1]  is  describing  a  method  for 
integrating  cryptography  and  steganography  together 
through image processing. The work started by clarifying 
the  way  for encryption of the secret text before hiding  it 
in the image. Then, the encrypted data is to be hidden in 
the  image  through  the  least  significant  bit  (LSB)  image 
based  steganography.  The  paper  did  not  describe  the 
crypto algorithm  used but showed advantage of practical 
implementation  benefits  with  acceptable  security.  The 
research  used  random  size  of  key  that  is  flexible 
according  to  size  of  the  data.  This  made  the  third  party 
disability to predict the size of key and data easily. 

Mehdi  Hussain  presents  image  steganography  LSB 
technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide

into the least significant bits of the three pixels as part of 
the image, the resulting grid is as follows:  

Pixel 1: 00101101 
Pixel 2: 10100110   
Pixel 3: 11010010   

00011101 
11000101   
10101100   

11011100 
00001101 
01100011 

Notice that the LSB of the last byte of Pixel 3 is not
affected due to the completion of embedding all the secret
bits in the image; so it is kept unchanged.

sensitive  secret  text  data  message  as  the  poem  “The  cat 
 
and  the  moon”  for  William  B  Yeats  (1865-1939).  The 
algorithm  first  encrypt  the  sensitive  text  data  (the  poem) 
with the secret key “nouf” and analyze the encrypted text 
bits against the “max encrypted text char hidden”, which 
is  dependent  on  the  image  based  steganography  LSB 
technique.  The  button  “Marge  text  with  img”  cannot  be 
 
active except if the image is able to hold all the encrypted 
bits. The output of hiding the sensitive data in the 2-layer 
system  is  imbedded  into  the  cover  stego  image.  This 
hiding  process  output  stego  image  can  be  saved  within 
the PC by clicking the button “save stego image”. 
 
 
B.  Retrieving Back the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

 

 

The  interface  shown  in  Fig.  5  can  be  used  as  an 
 
example of retrieving sensitive data that was hidden using 
the 2-layer security system. By pressing the button “Text 
 
decryption”  the  program  will  operate  retrieving  back  the 
secret  sensitive  text  data.  It  starts  by  sensing  the  LSBs 
within  the  stego  image  collecting  the  bits  together 
forming  the  ciphertext.  Generating  the  ciphertext  is 
 
representing  reversing  the  stego  layer  process.  Then,  the 
ciphertext is needs the secret key as inputs to the reverse 
crypto  layer  that  decrypts  the  ciphertext  generating  back 
the  secret  sensitive  data  message,  following  Fig.  2 
process of retrieving back secret text data. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  2-layer  security  system  for  hiding  sensitive  text 
data  on  personal  computers  is  implemented  on  a  visual 
basic  programming  platform.  We  used  visual  basic 
language  Tenth  Edition  due  to  its  flexibility,  wideness 
spread, and easy to learn, such that any programmer can 
simply  find  it  and  redesign  the  system  and  verify  our 
work.  The  aim  of  this  implementation  is  to  study  the 
2-layer security system idea in depth and to test different 
situations  to  enhance  this  important  academic  research 
field.  The  implementation  is  putting  a  target  of  helping 
security  crypto  designers  and  programmers  to  improve 
our  system  idea  and  make  it  practically  usable.  Another 
interesting  feature  found  in  our  software  platform,  i.e. 
visual  basic  language  tenth  edition,  is  its  availability  of 
 
many libraries of pictures that can be taken as advantage 
 
of it in all testing experimentations. 

 
Running  the  system  implementation  begins  with  the 
 
software asking for the secret sensitive text data message 
and  the  secret  key,  which  is  representing  starting  the 
operation  of  the  crypto  layer.  Within  this  layer  process, 
the  program  converts  each  character  of  the  sensitive 
secret  text  into  an  array  of  binary  bytes  to  be  encrypted 
using  AES.  The  second  layer,  i.e.  steganography  layer, 
also asks for an RGB image as cover media, such that its 
pixels  are  also  converted  into  binary  form.  This  stego 
layer  can  start  its  process  at  the  same  time  while  crypto 
layer  is  running,  i.e.  preparing  the  image  as  binary  bits, 
but  cannot  start  hiding  data  except  after  ciphertext  is 
 
generated  from  the  crypto  layer.  Each  pixel  within  the 
RGB  image  has  3  channels,  namely  red,  green  and  blue 
(RGB)  representing  a  byte  of  8  bits  each.  Therefore, 
using  the  least  significant  bits  (LSB)  image  based 
steganography in our original system hides 3 bits in each 
 
pixel. 

 

 

A.  Hiding the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

The  implementation  interface  of  the  2-layer  security 
system presented is shown in Fig. 4. The interface shows 
the  bits  statistics  that  are  generated  and  used  by  the 
crypto layer and the stego layer together. The process of 
 
hiding sensitive text starting by AES encryption followed 
by  the  image  based  steganography  describes  an  example 
of hiding sensitive data in a picture as shown in Fig. 4.

To  check  for  the  system  security  of  the  stego  layer 
using  1LSB  image  based  steganography,  both  original 
and  stego  images  are  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  As 
 
observed  in  the  example  of  Fig.  6,  the  different  between 
the  original  image  and  the  Stego  image  cannot  be 
 
observed. It is so low such that no one can guess its usage 
in  the  information  hiding  process.  The  security  is  high 
because  we  just  use  the  LSB  in  hiding  information  and 
the change in image is almost unnoticeable.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Hiding sensitive secret text  within personal computers 
(PC) has privilege of the ability to utilize some of the PC 
available  files  to  act  as  the  cover  media.  Interestingly 
choosing  among  personal  images  can  be  assumed  fully 
trusted confidential and only known by the PC user. This 
trust to hide within PC images played as real application 
behind  image  based  steganography  to  secure  sensitive 
text  data.  However,  the  security  of  the  cover  media,  i.e. 
images  on  the  PC,  is  based  on  the  trust  that  the  PC  data 
cannot  be  penetrated  by  any  means,  which  is  difficult  to 
assure and claim that the images are fully safe. This claim 
justified  the  need  to  add  another  security  layer  to  insure 
that  even  for  the  very  difficult  security  penetration;  still 
the  sensitive  data  are  not  harmed  or  used  negatively.  In 
other  words,  securing  the  data  by  steganography  alone 
cannot be justified and completely relayed on, making the 
need  to  add  another  security  layer  [1].  We  in  this  paper, 
present  the  2-layer  security  system  utilizing  image  base 
steganography  as  PC  dependant  layer  as  well  as  AES 
cryptography as independent assurance layer. 

2-layers  security  system,  i.e.  cryptography  layer  and 
steganography layer are the main hiding techniques, used 
to  insure  full  protection  [2]  of  the  sensitive  information 
on  a  PC.  Several  sensitive  text  data  examples  can  be 
expressed  as  clear  application  of  our  proposed  system 
such  as  e-mail  messages,  credit  card 
information,

corporate  data,  etc.  Steganography,  as  one  of  the  layer’s 
hiding  techniques,  is  derived  from  “the  Greek  words 
stegos  meaning  “cover”  and  grafia  meaning  “writing” 
defining  it  as  covered  writing”  [3].  Steganography,  in 
general,  uses  any  cover  object  of  media  types,  i.e.  text, 
image,  audio  and  videos,  to  hide  the  secret  data  in  it. 
After combining the secret with the cover object (making 
it  PC  dependant),  the  resulted  file  is  known  as  the  stego 
media.  

Cryptography,  as  the  other  layer  within  this  security 
system,  is  PC  independent  and  completely  deferent  than 
steganography.  Cryptography  is  mainly  encrypting  the 
secret plain text converting it to cipher text. Cryptography 
normally  requires  a  secret  key  for  the  encryption/ 
decryption  process  to  secure  the  sensitive  data  from  the 
third party. In our security system, the sensitive text data 
passes through the crypto layer involving a security  key, 
followed by the steganography layer resulting  the output 
file  as  Stego-Image.  Fig.  1  shows  the  main  overview  of 
the method using the two layer techniques [4].

completely  different  [5].  In  steganography,  the  sensitive 
text message is there, but nobody notices it or even aware 
that  it  exist  [6].  However,  once  noticed,  it  can  be  read. 
Cryptography,  on  the  other  hand,  is  secret  writing. 
Anybody  can  see  the  encrypted  sensitive  message,  but 

Lecture Notes on Information Theory Vol. 2, No. 2, June 2014

nobody  else  than  intended  ones  can  read  it.  Usually, 
crypto-methods  works  on  the  sensitive  text  letters  to  be 
re-arranged, or replaced by different letters, according to 
the  specific  scheme  triggered  by  a  secret  key,  that  only 
the sender and receiver are familiar with [7]. 

In  this  paper  we  proposed  and  implemented  the  two 
layers technique, i.e. cryptography and steganography, to 
benefit  from  both  and  give  the  best  possible  security 
dedicated for PC applications . The cryptography layer is 
using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto  algorithms. 
The  steganography  layer  is  adopting  the  image  based 
steganography  hiding  the  encrypted  data  in  the  least 
significant  bit  (LSB)  and  trying  to  improve  it  by 
increasing the LSBs [8]. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section, 
Section  2,  will  give  a  background  on  related  work  or 
similar  ideas  where  we  are  describing  several  methods 
utilizing  image  steganography  with  cryptography  to 
secure  information  that  are  found  suitable  for  PC  data 
hiding.  Section  3  presents  our  proposed  2-layer  security 
system  design  and  modeling  issues,  followed  by  a  brief 
explanation of the implementation in Section 4. Section 5 
gives  a  briefing  of  possible  improvement  in  the  capacity 
found suitable in the system stego layer to adopt 2LSB as 
well as 1LSB. Simple studies relating the security of the 
system  and  data  dependency  are  presented  in  Section  6. 
We show different scenarios of fixing/changing the secret 
sensitive  text  and  observing  the  security  effect  on 
different images observing interesting comparison results. 
Section  7  summarizes  the  work  in  the  conclusion  giving 
some ideas of related possible future work. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

Several methods are found in the literature suitable for 
PC  security  applications.  Interestingly,  we  are  focusing 
on  the  ones  utilizing  cryptography  and  steganography 
assumed  suitable  for  PC  security  applications.  For 
example,  Vikas  Tyagi  in  [1]  is  describing  a  method  for 
integrating  cryptography  and  steganography  together 
through image processing. The work started by clarifying 
the  way  for encryption of the secret text before hiding  it 
in the image. Then, the encrypted data is to be hidden in 
the  image  through  the  least  significant  bit  (LSB)  image 
based  steganography.  The  paper  did  not  describe  the 
crypto algorithm  used but showed advantage of practical 
implementation  benefits  with  acceptable  security.  The 
research  used  random  size  of  key  that  is  flexible 
according  to  size  of  the  data.  This  made  the  third  party 
disability to predict the size of key and data easily. 

Mehdi  Hussain  presents  image  steganography  LSB 
technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide 
data bits in an image by changing the LSB of each RGB 
image  pixels  color  byte.  The method  described  storing  3 
bits in each pixel by changing LSB bit of the red, green, 
and  blue  color  components,  since  every  color 
is 
represented  by  a  byte.  The  research  showed  real 
advantage  of  using  LSB  to  hide  secret  data  where  the 
change  in  the  pixels  will  have  very  low  effect  and 
unnoticed in observation. 

Domenico  in  [9],  proposed  image  steganography  and 
cryptography system (ISC) for securing data transfer. He 
is  using  images  as  cover  objects  for  steganography  and 
secret  key  for  the  cryptography.  The  performance  of  the 
proposed Image-Based Steganography and Cryptography 
(ISC) system was presented in his work. He compared his 
results  with  another  algorithm  in  the  literature  known  as 
F5  showing  improved  results.  It  was  found  that  the 
comparison  with  F5  is  replacing  the  least-significant  bit 
of  a  DCT  coefficient  with  message  data  which  may  be 
degrading  the  fairness  of  the  analysis.  The  work  in  [9] 
makes  F5  decrements  its  absolute  value  in  a  process 
called  matrix  encoding  claiming  as  a 
theoretically 
unbreakable cryptographic method based on image based 
one-time pad steganography. 

Mohammad in [10] proposed a technique to implement 
steganography and cryptography together to hide the data 
into  an  image  by  two  steps.  The  first  step,  finds  the 
shared stego-key between the two communication parties 
by applying Diffie Hellman Key exchange protocol [10]. 
The  second  step  makes  the  sender  use  the  secret  stego-
key  to  select  pixels  that  will  be  used  to  hide  secret  data. 
Each selected pixel will be used to hide 8 bits of data by 
using  LSB  method.  Although  the  method  showed  real 
interesting security features, it was very complicated with 
high unpractical overhead. 

Harshitha  [11]  proposed  a  security  method  in  which 
the  secret  message  is  first  encrypted  and  then  hidden  in 
cover  file  with  steganography.  The  encryption  of  the 
message is randomly permuted using the secret key. The 
steganography used  was based on the LSB algorithm  for 
both  embedding  and  extraction  process.  All  the  testing 
results  showed  interesting  features  generated  by  Matlab 
experimentations. 

Shailender  Gupta  in  [12]  used  two  crypto  techniques, 
i.e.  Rivest  Shamir  Adleman  (RSA)  algorithm  and  Diffie 
Hellman  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data.  Then  encrypted 
data  is  hidden  using  LSB  steganography  to  insure 
acceptable  security.  The  encrypted  data  as  well  as  the 
image pixels are all considered in their binary form. The 
secret encrypted bits replace the least significant bit (LSB) 
within  every  pixel.  The  presented  results  showed 
comparison  between  using  RSA  and  Diffie  Hellman  as 
crypto methods. Interestingly, it was reported that the use 
of  encryption  in  steganalysis  does  not  affect  the  time 
complexity  when  Diffie  Hellman  algorithm  is  used 
instead of RSA algorithm. 

A  last  explored  method  for  hiding  encrypted  secret 
message  inside  a  cover  file  has  been  introduced  by 
Joyshree  Nath  in  [13].  He  proposed  an  algorithm  for 
encrypting  the  secret  message  with  relation  to  the  work 
proposed in [14]. The work modified the idea of play fair 
method  into  a  new  platform  where  they  can  encrypt  or 
decrypt  any  file.  Their  method  is  dependent  on  the 
random text-key which is to be supplied by the user. They 
introduced  a  new  randomization  method  for  generating 
the  randomized  key  matrix  to  encrypt  plain  text  file  and 
to  decrypt  cipher  text  file.  They  also  introduced  a  new 
algorithm  for  encrypting  the  plain  text  multiple  times 
increasing security by increasing system complexity.

In 

The  two-layers  system  can  be  observed  as  a  process 
flow graph (Fig. 2) clarifying the storing point of view as 
well  as  the  retrieving  point  of  view.  The  cryptography 
layer  is  using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto 
algorithm,  i.e.  the  sensitive  text  is  going  through  the 
symmetric key encryption using Rijndael AES algorithm. 
The  secret  key  used  in  encryption  in  the  storing  flow 
graph  is  needed  as  is  in  the  decryption  process  when 
retreiving  the  data  is  desired.  This  AES  key  can  be  of 
several  lengths,  i.e.  128, 192 and  256  bits,  which  results 
in  10,  12  and  14  rounds  of  crypto  layer  operations, 
respectively. Our system data length is fixed to 128 bits.

The crypto layer input as well as intermediate data can 
be  considered  as  a  matrix  with  four  rows  and  four 
columns  called  states.  Each  element  of  the  matrix  is 
composed  of  eight  bits.  AES  is  based  on  a  design 
principle  known  as  a  substitution-permutation  network, 
combination of both Substitution and Combination, and is 
fast in both software and hardware as explained in [9]. 

The  AES  algorithm  has  four  basic  transformations,  as 

observed in Fig. 3, described briefly as follows: 

1).  Sub  Byte  Transformation 

a  nonlinear 
transformation applied to the elements of the matrix. This 
first step in each round is a simple substitution.

2).  Shift  Rows  Transformation  -  a  cyclical  shift 
operation with constant offsets, applied to the rows of the 
matrix 

3).  Mix  Columns  Transformation  -  the  third  step  is  a 
resource intensive transformation on the columns of state 
under  which  the  four  elements  of  each  column  are 
multiplied  by  a  polynomial,  essentially  diffusing  each 
element  of  the  column  over  all  four  elements  of  that 
column. 

4). Add Round Key Transformation - performs modulo 
2 (XOR) operation with the round key, which is obtained 
from  the  initial  key  by  a  key  expansion  procedure.  The 
encryption flow starts with the addition of the initial key 
to the plaintext. Then, the iteration continues for (Nr - 1) 
rounds  (Nr  being  the  total  number  of  rounds).  In  last 
round,  the  Mix  Column  step  is  bypassed.  AES  can  be 
understood in more depth in many resources such as [10].

The steganography layer in our system is adopting the 
image based steganography as in [1] hiding the encrypted 
data coming out of the cryptography layer in the. In fact, 
we  improved  the  system  capacity  trying  to  increase  the 
hidden  bits  in  the  image  using  several  least  significant 
bits (LSBs) instead of only one as will be clarified in the 
next section.  

The main idea used in the image based steganography 
hiding  in  LSBs  can  be  explained  by  an  example  of 
embedding  the  number  200.  When  the  number  200, 
which is 11001000 in binary representation, is embedded 
into the least significant bits of the three pixels as part of 
the image, the resulting grid is as follows:  

Pixel 1: 00101101 
Pixel 2: 10100110   
Pixel 3: 11010010   

00011101 
11000101   
10101100   

11011100 
00001101 
01100011 

Notice that the LSB of the last byte of Pixel 3 is not
affected due to the completion of embedding all the secret
bits in the image; so it is kept unchanged.

sensitive  secret  text  data  message  as  the  poem  “The  cat 
 
and  the  moon”  for  William  B  Yeats  (1865-1939).  The 
algorithm  first  encrypt  the  sensitive  text  data  (the  poem) 
with the secret key “nouf” and analyze the encrypted text 
bits against the “max encrypted text char hidden”, which 
is  dependent  on  the  image  based  steganography  LSB 
technique.  The  button  “Marge  text  with  img”  cannot  be 
 
active except if the image is able to hold all the encrypted 
bits. The output of hiding the sensitive data in the 2-layer 
system  is  imbedded  into  the  cover  stego  image.  This 
hiding  process  output  stego  image  can  be  saved  within 
the PC by clicking the button “save stego image”. 
 
 
B.  Retrieving Back the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

 

 

The  interface  shown  in  Fig.  5  can  be  used  as  an 
 
example of retrieving sensitive data that was hidden using 
the 2-layer security system. By pressing the button “Text 
 
decryption”  the  program  will  operate  retrieving  back  the 
secret  sensitive  text  data.  It  starts  by  sensing  the  LSBs 
within  the  stego  image  collecting  the  bits  together 
forming  the  ciphertext.  Generating  the  ciphertext  is 
 
representing  reversing  the  stego  layer  process.  Then,  the 
ciphertext is needs the secret key as inputs to the reverse 
crypto  layer  that  decrypts  the  ciphertext  generating  back 
the  secret  sensitive  data  message,  following  Fig.  2 
process of retrieving back secret text data. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  2-layer  security  system  for  hiding  sensitive  text 
data  on  personal  computers  is  implemented  on  a  visual 
basic  programming  platform.  We  used  visual  basic 
language  Tenth  Edition  due  to  its  flexibility,  wideness 
spread, and easy to learn, such that any programmer can 
simply  find  it  and  redesign  the  system  and  verify  our 
work.  The  aim  of  this  implementation  is  to  study  the 
2-layer security system idea in depth and to test different 
situations  to  enhance  this  important  academic  research 
field.  The  implementation  is  putting  a  target  of  helping 
security  crypto  designers  and  programmers  to  improve 
our  system  idea  and  make  it  practically  usable.  Another 
interesting  feature  found  in  our  software  platform,  i.e. 
visual  basic  language  tenth  edition,  is  its  availability  of 
 
many libraries of pictures that can be taken as advantage 
 
of it in all testing experimentations. 

 
Running  the  system  implementation  begins  with  the 
 
software asking for the secret sensitive text data message 
and  the  secret  key,  which  is  representing  starting  the 
operation  of  the  crypto  layer.  Within  this  layer  process, 
the  program  converts  each  character  of  the  sensitive 
secret  text  into  an  array  of  binary  bytes  to  be  encrypted 
using  AES.  The  second  layer,  i.e.  steganography  layer, 
also asks for an RGB image as cover media, such that its 
pixels  are  also  converted  into  binary  form.  This  stego 
layer  can  start  its  process  at  the  same  time  while  crypto 
layer  is  running,  i.e.  preparing  the  image  as  binary  bits, 
but  cannot  start  hiding  data  except  after  ciphertext  is 
 
generated  from  the  crypto  layer.  Each  pixel  within  the 
RGB  image  has  3  channels,  namely  red,  green  and  blue 
(RGB)  representing  a  byte  of  8  bits  each.  Therefore, 
using  the  least  significant  bits  (LSB)  image  based 
steganography in our original system hides 3 bits in each 
 
pixel.

To  check  for  the  system  security  of  the  stego  layer 
using  1LSB  image  based  steganography,  both  original 
and  stego  images  are  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  As 
 
observed  in  the  example  of  Fig.  6,  the  different  between 
the  original  image  and  the  Stego  image  cannot  be 
 
observed. It is so low such that no one can guess its usage 
in  the  information  hiding  process.  The  security  is  high 
because  we  just  use  the  LSB  in  hiding  information  and 
the change in image is almost unnoticeable.

V.  CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT STUDY IN THE 
STEGANOGRAPHY LAYER OF THE SYSTEM 

VI.  SYSTEM SECURITY AND DATA DEPENDENCY 

ANALYSING 1LSB VS. 2LSB 

To  study  improving  the  capacity  within  the  second 
layer  stego-images,  i.e.  when  hiding  the  encrypted 
sensitive  data  within  images,  we  tested  a  picture  hiding 
bits within different Least Significant Bits (LSB), namely 
1LSB,  2LSB,  3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB. 
These  tests  are  considered  differently  from  what  is 
presented in [16] and [17], which can be in some relation 
to  the  improvement  of  experimentations  in  [18].  In  fact, 
all  our  exploration  analysis  have  been  performed 
assuming  changing  the  bits  showing  real  interesting 
results (as shown in Fig. 7).

It  can  be  noticed  clearly  that  the  change  of  1LSB  or 
2LSB does not show difference while more than that, i.e. 
3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB,  are  resulting  in 
degrading  the  pictures  quality  and  showing  distortion. 
This  capacity  study  made  the  steganography  used  in  the 
second  layer  of  our  security  system  justified  to  focus  on 
the possibility of changing the 1LSB and 2LSB only. 

Our  work  used  2LSB  image  based  steganography  in 
the  stego  layer  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  hidden 
sensitive  text.  The  capacity  within  the  stego  layer 
increased  from  3  bits/pixel  to  6  bits/pixel.  Theoretically 
the  study  of  the  security  did  not  depend  on  the 
observation  alone,  we  made  a  detailed  study  testing  the 
difference between 1LSB and 2LSB on the changed bits. 
Because  this  study  depends  heavily  on  the  data  bits 
values,  30  different  pictures  have  been  involved  as 
detailed in the next section.   

The  same  secret  sensitive  text  message,  i.e.  the  poem 
“The cat and the moon”, is used to be hidden on different 
pictures  as  first  testing  study.  Then,  the  picture  is  fixed 
and the testing tries different secret sensitive text data. 

A.  Fixing Sensitive Secret Text-Data and Changing 

Stego-images: 

In  this  test,  we  select  30  different  PC  images  (Fig.  8) 
all within same size of 332x332 pixels to be used as cover 
images for the stego layer.  

The  test  compares  adopting  the  two  acceptable  least 
signification  bit  image  based  steganography,  i.e.  1LSB 
and 2LSB. Using 1LSB for hiding the secret  message of 
7065  bits  can  hide  3444  character  in  the  image  of  size 
332 x 332.

The  security  testing  of  fixing  the  sensitive  text  to  be

changing the bits, i.e. 1LSB and 2LSB, based on the data 
used. This gives the real indication of the security of the 
system  which  can  be  dependant  completely  on  the  data 
available that cannot be expected, as shown in Fig. 9.

The changed bits in Fig. 9 is comparing between using

layer  with  2LSB  is  always  giving  higher  bits  change 
compared to the 1LSB, which is expected.

INTRODUCTION 

Hiding sensitive secret text  within personal computers 
(PC) has privilege of the ability to utilize some of the PC 
available  files  to  act  as  the  cover  media.  Interestingly 
choosing  among  personal  images  can  be  assumed  fully 
trusted confidential and only known by the PC user. This 
trust to hide within PC images played as real application 
behind  image  based  steganography  to  secure  sensitive 
text  data.  However,  the  security  of  the  cover  media,  i.e. 
images  on  the  PC,  is  based  on  the  trust  that  the  PC  data 
cannot  be  penetrated  by  any  means,  which  is  difficult  to 
assure and claim that the images are fully safe. This claim 
justified  the  need  to  add  another  security  layer  to  insure 
that  even  for  the  very  difficult  security  penetration;  still 
the  sensitive  data  are  not  harmed  or  used  negatively.  In 
other  words,  securing  the  data  by  steganography  alone 
cannot be justified and completely relayed on, making the 
need  to  add  another  security  layer  [1].  We  in  this  paper, 
present  the  2-layer  security  system  utilizing  image  base 
steganography  as  PC  dependant  layer  as  well  as  AES 
cryptography as independent assurance layer. 

2-layers  security  system,  i.e.  cryptography  layer  and 
steganography layer are the main hiding techniques, used 
to  insure  full  protection  [2]  of  the  sensitive  information 
on  a  PC.  Several  sensitive  text  data  examples  can  be 
expressed  as  clear  application  of  our  proposed  system 
such  as  e-mail  messages,  credit  card 
information,

corporate  data,  etc.  Steganography,  as  one  of  the  layer’s 
hiding  techniques,  is  derived  from  “the  Greek  words 
stegos  meaning  “cover”  and  grafia  meaning  “writing” 
defining  it  as  covered  writing”  [3].  Steganography,  in 
general,  uses  any  cover  object  of  media  types,  i.e.  text, 
image,  audio  and  videos,  to  hide  the  secret  data  in  it. 
After combining the secret with the cover object (making 
it  PC  dependant),  the  resulted  file  is  known  as  the  stego 
media.  

Cryptography,  as  the  other  layer  within  this  security 
system,  is  PC  independent  and  completely  deferent  than 
steganography.  Cryptography  is  mainly  encrypting  the 
secret plain text converting it to cipher text. Cryptography 
normally  requires  a  secret  key  for  the  encryption/ 
decryption  process  to  secure  the  sensitive  data  from  the 
third party. In our security system, the sensitive text data 
passes through the crypto layer involving a security  key, 
followed by the steganography layer resulting  the output 
file  as  Stego-Image.  Fig.  1  shows  the  main  overview  of 
the method using the two layer techniques [4].

completely  different  [5].  In  steganography,  the  sensitive 
text message is there, but nobody notices it or even aware 
that  it  exist  [6].  However,  once  noticed,  it  can  be  read. 
Cryptography,  on  the  other  hand,  is  secret  writing. 
Anybody  can  see  the  encrypted  sensitive  message,  but

crypto-methods  works  on  the  sensitive  text  letters  to  be 
re-arranged, or replaced by different letters, according to 
the  specific  scheme  triggered  by  a  secret  key,  that  only 
the sender and receiver are familiar with [7]. 

In  this  paper  we  proposed  and  implemented  the  two 
layers technique, i.e. cryptography and steganography, to 
benefit  from  both  and  give  the  best  possible  security 
dedicated for PC applications . The cryptography layer is 
using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto  algorithms. 
The  steganography  layer  is  adopting  the  image  based 
steganography  hiding  the  encrypted  data  in  the  least 
significant  bit  (LSB)  and  trying  to  improve  it  by 
increasing the LSBs [8]. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section, 
Section  2,  will  give  a  background  on  related  work  or 
similar  ideas  where  we  are  describing  several  methods 
utilizing  image  steganography  with  cryptography  to 
secure  information  that  are  found  suitable  for  PC  data 
hiding.  Section  3  presents  our  proposed  2-layer  security 
system  design  and  modeling  issues,  followed  by  a  brief 
explanation of the implementation in Section 4. Section 5 
gives  a  briefing  of  possible  improvement  in  the  capacity 
found suitable in the system stego layer to adopt 2LSB as 
well as 1LSB. Simple studies relating the security of the 
system  and  data  dependency  are  presented  in  Section  6. 
We show different scenarios of fixing/changing the secret 
sensitive  text  and  observing  the  security  effect  on 
different images observing interesting comparison results. 
Section  7  summarizes  the  work  in  the  conclusion  giving 
some ideas of related possible future work. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

Several methods are found in the literature suitable for 
PC  security  applications.  Interestingly,  we  are  focusing 
on  the  ones  utilizing  cryptography  and  steganography 
assumed  suitable  for  PC  security  applications.  For 
example,  Vikas  Tyagi  in  [1]  is  describing  a  method  for 
integrating  cryptography  and  steganography  together 
through image processing. The work started by clarifying 
the  way  for encryption of the secret text before hiding  it 
in the image. Then, the encrypted data is to be hidden in 
the  image  through  the  least  significant  bit  (LSB)  image 
based  steganography.  The  paper  did  not  describe  the 
crypto algorithm  used but showed advantage of practical 
implementation  benefits  with  acceptable  security.  The 
research  used  random  size  of  key  that  is  flexible 
according  to  size  of  the  data.  This  made  the  third  party 
disability to predict the size of key and data easily. 

Mehdi  Hussain  presents  image  steganography  LSB 
technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide 
data bits in an image by changing the LSB of each RGB 
image  pixels  color  byte.  The method  described  storing  3 
bits in each pixel by changing LSB bit of the red, green, 
and  blue  color  components,  since  every  color 
is 
represented  by  a  byte.  The  research  showed  real 
advantage  of  using  LSB  to  hide  secret  data  where  the 
change  in  the  pixels  will  have  very  low  effect  and 
unnoticed in observation. 

Domenico  in  [9],  proposed  image  steganography  and 
cryptography system (ISC) for securing data transfer. He 
is  using  images  as  cover  objects  for  steganography  and 
secret  key  for  the  cryptography.  The  performance  of  the 
proposed Image-Based Steganography and Cryptography 
(ISC) system was presented in his work. He compared his 
results  with  another  algorithm  in  the  literature  known  as 
F5  showing  improved  results.  It  was  found  that  the 
comparison  with  F5  is  replacing  the  least-significant  bit 
of  a  DCT  coefficient  with  message  data  which  may  be 
degrading  the  fairness  of  the  analysis.  The  work  in  [9] 
makes  F5  decrements  its  absolute  value  in  a  process 
called  matrix  encoding  claiming  as  a 
theoretically 
unbreakable cryptographic method based on image based 
one-time pad steganography. 

Mohammad in [10] proposed a technique to implement 
steganography and cryptography together to hide the data 
into  an  image  by  two  steps.  The  first  step,  finds  the 
shared stego-key between the two communication parties 
by applying Diffie Hellman Key exchange protocol [10]. 
The  second  step  makes  the  sender  use  the  secret  stego-
key  to  select  pixels  that  will  be  used  to  hide  secret  data. 
Each selected pixel will be used to hide 8 bits of data by 
using  LSB  method.  Although  the  method  showed  real 
interesting security features, it was very complicated with 
high unpractical overhead. 

Harshitha  [11]  proposed  a  security  method  in  which 
the  secret  message  is  first  encrypted  and  then  hidden  in 
cover  file  with  steganography.  The  encryption  of  the 
message is randomly permuted using the secret key. The 
steganography used  was based on the LSB algorithm  for 
both  embedding  and  extraction  process.  All  the  testing 
results  showed  interesting  features  generated  by  Matlab 
experimentations. 

Shailender  Gupta  in  [12]  used  two  crypto  techniques, 
i.e.  Rivest  Shamir  Adleman  (RSA)  algorithm  and  Diffie 
Hellman  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data.  Then  encrypted 
data  is  hidden  using  LSB  steganography  to  insure 
acceptable  security.  The  encrypted  data  as  well  as  the 
image pixels are all considered in their binary form. The 
secret encrypted bits replace the least significant bit (LSB) 
within  every  pixel.  The  presented  results  showed 
comparison  between  using  RSA  and  Diffie  Hellman  as 
crypto methods. Interestingly, it was reported that the use 
of  encryption  in  steganalysis  does  not  affect  the  time 
complexity  when  Diffie  Hellman  algorithm  is  used 
instead of RSA algorithm. 

A  last  explored  method  for  hiding  encrypted  secret 
message  inside  a  cover  file  has  been  introduced  by 
Joyshree  Nath  in  [13].  He  proposed  an  algorithm  for 
encrypting  the  secret  message  with  relation  to  the  work 
proposed in [14]. The work modified the idea of play fair 
method  into  a  new  platform  where  they  can  encrypt  or 
decrypt  any  file.  Their  method  is  dependent  on  the 
random text-key which is to be supplied by the user. They 
introduced  a  new  randomization  method  for  generating 
the  randomized  key  matrix  to  encrypt  plain  text  file  and 
to  decrypt  cipher  text  file.  They  also  introduced  a  new 
algorithm  for  encrypting  the  plain  text  multiple  times 
increasing security by increasing system complexity.

In 

The  two-layers  system  can  be  observed  as  a  process 
flow graph (Fig. 2) clarifying the storing point of view as 
well  as  the  retrieving  point  of  view.  The  cryptography 
layer  is  using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto 
algorithm,  i.e.  the  sensitive  text  is  going  through  the 
symmetric key encryption using Rijndael AES algorithm. 
The  secret  key  used  in  encryption  in  the  storing  flow 
graph  is  needed  as  is  in  the  decryption  process  when 
retreiving  the  data  is  desired.  This  AES  key  can  be  of 
several  lengths,  i.e.  128, 192 and  256  bits,  which  results 
in  10,  12  and  14  rounds  of  crypto  layer  operations, 
respectively. Our system data length is fixed to 128 bits.

The crypto layer input as well as intermediate data can 
be  considered  as  a  matrix  with  four  rows  and  four 
columns  called  states.  Each  element  of  the  matrix  is 
composed  of  eight  bits.  AES  is  based  on  a  design 
principle  known  as  a  substitution-permutation  network, 
combination of both Substitution and Combination, and is 
fast in both software and hardware as explained in [9]. 

The  AES  algorithm  has  four  basic  transformations,  as 

observed in Fig. 3, described briefly as follows: 

1).  Sub  Byte  Transformation 

a  nonlinear 
transformation applied to the elements of the matrix. This 
first step in each round is a simple substitution. 

-

2).  Shift  Rows  Transformation  -  a  cyclical  shift 
operation with constant offsets, applied to the rows of the 
matrix 

3).  Mix  Columns  Transformation  -  the  third  step  is  a 
resource intensive transformation on the columns of state 
under  which  the  four  elements  of  each  column  are 
multiplied  by  a  polynomial,  essentially  diffusing  each 
element  of  the  column  over  all  four  elements  of  that 
column. 

4). Add Round Key Transformation - performs modulo 
2 (XOR) operation with the round key, which is obtained 
from  the  initial  key  by  a  key  expansion  procedure.  The 
encryption flow starts with the addition of the initial key 
to the plaintext. Then, the iteration continues for (Nr - 1) 
rounds  (Nr  being  the  total  number  of  rounds).  In  last 
round,  the  Mix  Column  step  is  bypassed.  AES  can  be 
understood in more depth in many resources such as [10].

The steganography layer in our system is adopting the 
image based steganography as in [1] hiding the encrypted 
data coming out of the cryptography layer in the. In fact, 
we  improved  the  system  capacity  trying  to  increase  the 
hidden  bits  in  the  image  using  several  least  significant 
bits (LSBs) instead of only one as will be clarified in the 
next section.  

The main idea used in the image based steganography 
hiding  in  LSBs  can  be  explained  by  an  example  of 
embedding  the  number  200.  When  the  number  200, 
which is 11001000 in binary representation, is embedded 
into the least significant bits of the three pixels as part of 
the image, the resulting grid is as follows:  

Pixel 1: 00101101 
Pixel 2: 10100110   
Pixel 3: 11010010   

00011101 
11000101   
10101100   

11011100 
00001101 
01100011 

Notice that the LSB of the last byte of Pixel 3 is not
affected due to the completion of embedding all the secret
bits in the image; so it is kept unchanged.

algorithm  first  encrypt  the  sensitive  text  data  (the  poem) 
with the secret key “nouf” and analyze the encrypted text 
bits against the “max encrypted text char hidden”, which 
is  dependent  on  the  image  based  steganography  LSB 
technique.  The  button  “Marge  text  with  img”  cannot  be 
 
active except if the image is able to hold all the encrypted 
bits. The output of hiding the sensitive data in the 2-layer 
system  is  imbedded  into  the  cover  stego  image.  This 
hiding  process  output  stego  image  can  be  saved  within 
the PC by clicking the button “save stego image”. 
 
 
B.  Retrieving Back the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

 

 

The  interface  shown  in  Fig.  5  can  be  used  as  an 
 
example of retrieving sensitive data that was hidden using 
the 2-layer security system. By pressing the button “Text 
 
decryption”  the  program  will  operate  retrieving  back  the 
secret  sensitive  text  data.  It  starts  by  sensing  the  LSBs 
within  the  stego  image  collecting  the  bits  together 
forming  the  ciphertext.  Generating  the  ciphertext  is 
 
representing  reversing  the  stego  layer  process.  Then,  the 
ciphertext is needs the secret key as inputs to the reverse 
crypto  layer  that  decrypts  the  ciphertext  generating  back 
the  secret  sensitive  data  message,  following  Fig.  2 
process of retrieving back secret text data. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  2-layer  security  system  for  hiding  sensitive  text 
data  on  personal  computers  is  implemented  on  a  visual 
basic  programming  platform.  We  used  visual  basic 
language  Tenth  Edition  due  to  its  flexibility,  wideness 
spread, and easy to learn, such that any programmer can 
simply  find  it  and  redesign  the  system  and  verify  our 
work.  The  aim  of  this  implementation  is  to  study  the 
2-layer security system idea in depth and to test different 
situations  to  enhance  this  important  academic  research 
field.  The  implementation  is  putting  a  target  of  helping 
security  crypto  designers  and  programmers  to  improve 
our  system  idea  and  make  it  practically  usable.  Another 
interesting  feature  found  in  our  software  platform,  i.e. 
visual  basic  language  tenth  edition,  is  its  availability  of 
 
many libraries of pictures that can be taken as advantage 
 
of it in all testing experimentations. 

 
Running  the  system  implementation  begins  with  the 
 
software asking for the secret sensitive text data message 
and  the  secret  key,  which  is  representing  starting  the 
operation  of  the  crypto  layer.  Within  this  layer  process, 
the  program  converts  each  character  of  the  sensitive 
secret  text  into  an  array  of  binary  bytes  to  be  encrypted 
using  AES.  The  second  layer,  i.e.  steganography  layer, 
also asks for an RGB image as cover media, such that its 
pixels  are  also  converted  into  binary  form.  This  stego 
layer  can  start  its  process  at  the  same  time  while  crypto 
layer  is  running,  i.e.  preparing  the  image  as  binary  bits, 
but  cannot  start  hiding  data  except  after  ciphertext  is 
 
generated  from  the  crypto  layer.  Each  pixel  within  the 
RGB  image  has  3  channels,  namely  red,  green  and  blue 
(RGB)  representing  a  byte  of  8  bits  each.  Therefore, 
using  the  least  significant  bits  (LSB)  image  based 
steganography in our original system hides 3 bits in each 
 
pixel. 

 

 

A.  Hiding the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

The  implementation  interface  of  the  2-layer  security 
system presented is shown in Fig. 4. The interface shows 
the  bits  statistics  that  are  generated  and  used  by  the 
crypto layer and the stego layer together. The process of 
 
hiding sensitive text starting by AES encryption followed 
by  the  image  based  steganography  describes  an  example 
of hiding sensitive data in a picture as shown in Fig. 4.

To  check  for  the  system  security  of  the  stego  layer 
using  1LSB  image  based  steganography,  both  original 
and  stego  images  are  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  As 
 
observed  in  the  example  of  Fig.  6,  the  different  between 
the  original  image  and  the  Stego  image  cannot  be 
 
observed. It is so low such that no one can guess its usage 
in  the  information  hiding  process.  The  security  is  high 
because  we  just  use  the  LSB  in  hiding  information  and 
the change in image is almost unnoticeable.

V.  CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT STUDY IN THE 
STEGANOGRAPHY LAYER OF THE SYSTEM 

VI.  SYSTEM SECURITY AND DATA DEPENDENCY 

ANALYSING 1LSB VS. 2LSB 

To  study  improving  the  capacity  within  the  second 
layer  stego-images,  i.e.  when  hiding  the  encrypted 
sensitive  data  within  images,  we  tested  a  picture  hiding 
bits within different Least Significant Bits (LSB), namely 
1LSB,  2LSB,  3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB. 
These  tests  are  considered  differently  from  what  is 
presented in [16] and [17], which can be in some relation 
to  the  improvement  of  experimentations  in  [18].  In  fact, 
all  our  exploration  analysis  have  been  performed 
assuming  changing  the  bits  showing  real  interesting 
results (as shown in Fig. 7).

It  can  be  noticed  clearly  that  the  change  of  1LSB  or 
2LSB does not show difference while more than that, i.e. 
3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB,  are  resulting  in 
degrading  the  pictures  quality  and  showing  distortion. 
This  capacity  study  made  the  steganography  used  in  the 
second  layer  of  our  security  system  justified  to  focus  on 
the possibility of changing the 1LSB and 2LSB only. 

Our  work  used  2LSB  image  based  steganography  in 
the  stego  layer  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  hidden 
sensitive  text.  The  capacity  within  the  stego  layer 
increased  from  3  bits/pixel  to  6  bits/pixel.  Theoretically 
the  study  of  the  security  did  not  depend  on  the 
observation  alone,  we  made  a  detailed  study  testing  the 
difference between 1LSB and 2LSB on the changed bits. 
Because  this  study  depends  heavily  on  the  data  bits 
values,  30  different  pictures  have  been  involved  as 
detailed in the next section.   

The  same  secret  sensitive  text  message,  i.e.  the  poem 
“The cat and the moon”, is used to be hidden on different 
pictures  as  first  testing  study.  Then,  the  picture  is  fixed 
and the testing tries different secret sensitive text data. 

A.  Fixing Sensitive Secret Text-Data and Changing 

Stego-images: 

In  this  test,  we  select  30  different  PC  images  (Fig.  8) 
all within same size of 332x332 pixels to be used as cover 
images for the stego layer.  

The  test  compares  adopting  the  two  acceptable  least 
signification  bit  image  based  steganography,  i.e.  1LSB 
and 2LSB. Using 1LSB for hiding the secret  message of 
7065  bits  can  hide  3444  character  in  the  image  of  size 
332 x 332.  

Using 

the 

two 

(2LSB) 
steganography as the stego layer capability increased the 
capacity of hiding information with acceptable security.

least 

The  security  testing  of  fixing  the  sensitive  text  to  be 
hidden and changing the pictures cover image resulted in 
changing the bits, i.e. 1LSB and 2LSB, based on the data 
used. This gives the real indication of the security of the 
system  which  can  be  dependant  completely  on  the  data 
available that cannot be expected, as shown in Fig. 9. 

 
Figure 9. Number of bits changed within the 30 pictures due to hiding 
the sensitive text with the 2-layer system utilizing 1LSB and 2LSB.  

The changed bits in Fig. 9 is comparing between using 
1LSB and 2LSB for every image. Observe that the stego 
layer  with  2LSB  is  always  giving  higher  bits  change 
compared to the 1LSB, which is expected.

Lecture Notes on Information Theory Vol. 2, No. 2, June 2014

We  formalized  the  security  difference  percentage 
based  on  the  bits  changed  within  every  image  based  on 
the 1LSB and 2LSB resulting the values shown in Figure 
10. These results (Fig. 10) are based on the real  security 
percentage  and  not  subject  to  personal  observations. 
Notes  that  Picture  29  is  giving  the  lowest  security 
percentage in both 1LSB and 2LSB techniques. However, 
several  pictures,  i.e.  9,  16,  18,  26,  28,  are  giving  better 
percentage  of  security  using  2LSB  compared  to  pictures 
13,  29  using  1LSB,  which  is  completely  unexpected.  In 
other words, some pictures may be giving higher security 
as  well  as  higher  capacity  when  compared  to  others, 
which  insists  on  running  the  hiding  process  on  different 
pictures and then choosing the best suitable option. 

B.  Fixing Stego-Images and Changing Sensitive Secret 

Text-Data: 

In  this  test,  we  use  the  picture  number  9  from  Fig.  8 
but  with  smaller  size  100  x  100  to  test  hiding  within  it 
two  different  sensitive  secret  messages:  sensitive  text-1 
and  sensitive  text-2.  Our  2-layer  security  system  hided 
this  text-1  and  text-2  data  both  using  the  normal  crypto 
layer  technique  and  the  steganography  layer  technique. 
However,  the  stego  layer  focuses  on  the  previously 
described  2LSB  steganography  technique.  The  sensitive 
secret text data are: 

text-1):  “The 

First  one:  (sensitive 

last  prophet, 
Muhammad [peace be upon him] was born in Makkah on 
Monday, 12th Rabi al Awwal. He was born as an orphan. 
He  was  brought  up  by  his  grandfather.  His  uncle,  Abu 
Talib,  took  care  of  him  when  he  was  eight  years  old. 
When  he  was  ten  or  twelve  years  old,  he  used  to  look 
after the sheep around Makkah. 

Muhammad  was  loving,  kind,  generous,  helpful  and 
honest man. He  was an example of prefect character. He 
lived a very simple life. He was fair in his dealings  with 
all  people  whether  they  are  friends  or  enemies'  .He  was 
known as Al-Sadiq and Al-Amin. 

He was injured by Quraish but he completed his duty. 
So, we  must follow  him and interrupt all people who try 
to  deform  something  about  his  life.  And  what  happen  in 
Denmark  nowadays  is  an  example  of  this  deed.  We 
should face every person try to assault him; this is one of 
our  duties  towards  him".  This  sensitive  text-1  had  870 
characters  as  plain  text.  When  encrypted  by  the  system 
crypto  layer  the  ciphertext  generated  resulted  in  1176 
characters. 

Second  one:  (sensitive  text-2):  “Most  people  who 
bother with the matter at all would admit that the English 
language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that 
we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our 
civilization  is  decadent  and  our  language  —  so  the 
argument  runs  —  must  inevitably  share  in  the  general 
collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of 
language  is  a  sentimental  archaism,  like  preferring 
candles  to  electric  light  or  hansom  cabs  to  aeroplanes. 
Underneath 
that 
language is a natural growth and not an instrument which 
we shape for our own purposes”. This sensitive text-2 had 
601  characters  as  plain 
text.  When  encrypted  as

ciphertext resulted in 812 characters. Our 2-layer security 
system hides this text-1 data using 2LSB technique. 

Picture 9 is chosen for this test because it gave the best 
percentage  of  security  shown  in  Fig.  10.  The  two 
different sensitive texts have been hidden and the resulted 
output stego image is shown in Fig. 11. It has been notesd 
that  both  secret  text  data,  i.e.  sensitive  text-1  and 
sensitive  text-2  are  not  showing  differences  in  the 
pictures.  In  fact,  observing  these  pictures  resulted  that 
some  PC  images  may  give  similar  characteristics  when 
different  hiding  secret  texts,  but  this  needs  further 
exploration and theoretical study.

VII.  CONCLUSION 

In  this  work  we  have  shown  how  to  design  2-layer 
security system for hiding sensitive text data on personal 
computers.  We  used  cryptography  layer  to  insure  PC 
independent security and stegonagraphy layer that is fully 
dependant  on  the  PC  data  available.  The  system  is 
implemented on visual basic platform showing interesting 
results.  The  system  steganography  layer  embedded  data 
in  the  image  using  several  LSB  attempts  to  enhance 
capacity  without  degrading  security,  which  resulted  in 
accepting  the  security  of  1LSB  and  2LSB  methods.  The 
system  implementation  tested  the  relation  between  the 
data to be secured and the cover images on the PC and its 
security effects by experimenting it on 30 different fixed 
size images showing interesting attractive results.  

As  future  work,  we  want  to  improve  the  crypto  layer 
by  testing  different  other  symmetric  key  algorithms  as 
well  as  exploring  the  possibility  of  benefitting  from 
asymmetric key cryptography. We plan studying different 
ways  to  improve  the  capacity  and  the  security  of  the 
system  for  PC  applications.  We  want  to  modify  the 
method to make it supporting other languages like Arabic, 
which may need some more research.

INTRODUCTION 

Hiding sensitive secret text  within personal computers 
(PC) has privilege of the ability to utilize some of the PC 
available  files  to  act  as  the  cover  media.  Interestingly 
choosing  among  personal  images  can  be  assumed  fully 
trusted confidential and only known by the PC user. This 
trust to hide within PC images played as real application 
behind  image  based  steganography  to  secure  sensitive 
text  data.  However,  the  security  of  the  cover  media,  i.e. 
images  on  the  PC,  is  based  on  the  trust  that  the  PC  data 
cannot  be  penetrated  by  any  means,  which  is  difficult  to 
assure and claim that the images are fully safe. This claim 
justified  the  need  to  add  another  security  layer  to  insure 
that  even  for  the  very  difficult  security  penetration;  still 
the  sensitive  data  are  not  harmed  or  used  negatively.  In 
other  words,  securing  the  data  by  steganography  alone 
cannot be justified and completely relayed on, making the 
need  to  add  another  security  layer  [1].  We  in  this  paper, 
present  the  2-layer  security  system  utilizing  image  base 
steganography  as  PC  dependant  layer  as  well  as  AES 
cryptography as independent assurance layer. 

2-layers  security  system,  i.e.  cryptography  layer  and 
steganography layer are the main hiding techniques, used 
to  insure  full  protection  [2]  of  the  sensitive  information 
on  a  PC.  Several  sensitive  text  data  examples  can  be 
expressed  as  clear  application  of  our  proposed  system 
such  as  e-mail  messages,  credit  card 
information,

corporate  data,  etc.  Steganography,  as  one  of  the  layer’s 
hiding  techniques,  is  derived  from  “the  Greek  words 
stegos  meaning  “cover”  and  grafia  meaning  “writing” 
defining  it  as  covered  writing”  [3].  Steganography,  in 
general,  uses  any  cover  object  of  media  types,  i.e.  text, 
image,  audio  and  videos,  to  hide  the  secret  data  in  it. 
After combining the secret with the cover object (making 
it  PC  dependant),  the  resulted  file  is  known  as  the  stego 
media.  

Cryptography,  as  the  other  layer  within  this  security 
system,  is  PC  independent  and  completely  deferent  than 
steganography.  Cryptography  is  mainly  encrypting  the 
secret plain text converting it to cipher text. Cryptography 
normally  requires  a  secret  key  for  the  encryption/ 
decryption  process  to  secure  the  sensitive  data  from  the 
third party. In our security system, the sensitive text data 
passes through the crypto layer involving a security  key, 
followed by the steganography layer resulting  the output 
file  as  Stego-Image.  Fig.  1  shows  the  main  overview  of 
the method using the two layer techniques [4].

completely  different  [5].  In  steganography,  the  sensitive 
text message is there, but nobody notices it or even aware 
that  it  exist  [6].  However,  once  noticed,  it  can  be  read. 
Cryptography,  on  the  other  hand,  is  secret  writing. 
Anybody  can  see  the  encrypted  sensitive  message,  but 

Lecture Notes on Information Theory Vol. 2, No. 2, June 2014

nobody  else  than  intended  ones  can  read  it.  Usually, 
crypto-methods  works  on  the  sensitive  text  letters  to  be 
re-arranged, or replaced by different letters, according to 
the  specific  scheme  triggered  by  a  secret  key,  that  only 
the sender and receiver are familiar with [7]. 

In  this  paper  we  proposed  and  implemented  the  two 
layers technique, i.e. cryptography and steganography, to 
benefit  from  both  and  give  the  best  possible  security 
dedicated for PC applications . The cryptography layer is 
using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto  algorithms. 
The  steganography  layer  is  adopting  the  image  based 
steganography  hiding  the  encrypted  data  in  the  least 
significant  bit  (LSB)  and  trying  to  improve  it  by 
increasing the LSBs [8]. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section, 
Section  2,  will  give  a  background  on  related  work  or 
similar  ideas  where  we  are  describing  several  methods 
utilizing  image  steganography  with  cryptography  to 
secure  information  that  are  found  suitable  for  PC  data 
hiding.  Section  3  presents  our  proposed  2-layer  security 
system  design  and  modeling  issues,  followed  by  a  brief 
explanation of the implementation in Section 4. Section 5 
gives  a  briefing  of  possible  improvement  in  the  capacity 
found suitable in the system stego layer to adopt 2LSB as 
well as 1LSB. Simple studies relating the security of the 
system  and  data  dependency  are  presented  in  Section  6. 
We show different scenarios of fixing/changing the secret 
sensitive  text  and  observing  the  security  effect  on 
different images observing interesting comparison results. 
Section  7  summarizes  the  work  in  the  conclusion  giving 
some ideas of related possible future work. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

Several methods are found in the literature suitable for 
PC  security  applications.  Interestingly,  we  are  focusing 
on  the  ones  utilizing  cryptography  and  steganography 
assumed  suitable  for  PC  security  applications.  For 
example,  Vikas  Tyagi  in  [1]  is  describing  a  method  for 
integrating  cryptography  and  steganography  together 
through image processing. The work started by clarifying 
the  way  for encryption of the secret text before hiding  it 
in the image. Then, the encrypted data is to be hidden in 
the  image  through  the  least  significant  bit  (LSB)  image 
based  steganography.  The  paper  did  not  describe  the 
crypto algorithm  used but showed advantage of practical 
implementation  benefits  with  acceptable  security.  The 
research  used  random  size  of  key  that  is  flexible 
according  to  size  of  the  data.  This  made  the  third  party 
disability to predict the size of key and data easily. 

Mehdi  Hussain  presents  image  steganography  LSB 
technique in [7]. He used the well known method to hide 
data bits in an image by changing the LSB of each RGB 
image  pixels  color  byte.  The method  described  storing  3 
bits in each pixel by changing LSB bit of the red, green, 
and  blue  color  components,  since  every  color 
is 
represented  by  a  byte.  The  research  showed  real 
advantage  of  using  LSB  to  hide  secret  data  where  the 
change  in  the  pixels  will  have  very  low  effect  and 
unnoticed in observation. 

Domenico  in  [9],  proposed  image  steganography  and 
cryptography system (ISC) for securing data transfer. He 
is  using  images  as  cover  objects  for  steganography  and 
secret  key  for  the  cryptography.  The  performance  of  the 
proposed Image-Based Steganography and Cryptography 
(ISC) system was presented in his work. He compared his 
results  with  another  algorithm  in  the  literature  known  as 
F5  showing  improved  results.  It  was  found  that  the 
comparison  with  F5  is  replacing  the  least-significant  bit 
of  a  DCT  coefficient  with  message  data  which  may  be 
degrading  the  fairness  of  the  analysis.  The  work  in  [9] 
makes  F5  decrements  its  absolute  value  in  a  process 
called  matrix  encoding  claiming  as  a 
theoretically 
unbreakable cryptographic method based on image based 
one-time pad steganography. 

Mohammad in [10] proposed a technique to implement 
steganography and cryptography together to hide the data 
into  an  image  by  two  steps.  The  first  step,  finds  the 
shared stego-key between the two communication parties 
by applying Diffie Hellman Key exchange protocol [10]. 
The  second  step  makes  the  sender  use  the  secret  stego-
key  to  select  pixels  that  will  be  used  to  hide  secret  data. 
Each selected pixel will be used to hide 8 bits of data by 
using  LSB  method.  Although  the  method  showed  real 
interesting security features, it was very complicated with 
high unpractical overhead. 

Harshitha  [11]  proposed  a  security  method  in  which 
the  secret  message  is  first  encrypted  and  then  hidden  in 
cover  file  with  steganography.  The  encryption  of  the 
message is randomly permuted using the secret key. The 
steganography used  was based on the LSB algorithm  for 
both  embedding  and  extraction  process.  All  the  testing 
results  showed  interesting  features  generated  by  Matlab 
experimentations. 

Shailender  Gupta  in  [12]  used  two  crypto  techniques, 
i.e.  Rivest  Shamir  Adleman  (RSA)  algorithm  and  Diffie 
Hellman  algorithm,  to  encrypt  the  data.  Then  encrypted 
data  is  hidden  using  LSB  steganography  to  insure 
acceptable  security.  The  encrypted  data  as  well  as  the 
image pixels are all considered in their binary form. The 
secret encrypted bits replace the least significant bit (LSB) 
within  every  pixel.  The  presented  results  showed 
comparison  between  using  RSA  and  Diffie  Hellman  as 
crypto methods. Interestingly, it was reported that the use 
of  encryption  in  steganalysis  does  not  affect  the  time 
complexity  when  Diffie  Hellman  algorithm  is  used 
instead of RSA algorithm. 

A  last  explored  method  for  hiding  encrypted  secret 
message  inside  a  cover  file  has  been  introduced  by 
Joyshree  Nath  in  [13].  He  proposed  an  algorithm  for 
encrypting  the  secret  message  with  relation  to  the  work 
proposed in [14]. The work modified the idea of play fair 
method  into  a  new  platform  where  they  can  encrypt  or 
decrypt  any  file.  Their  method  is  dependent  on  the 
random text-key which is to be supplied by the user. They 
introduced  a  new  randomization  method  for  generating 
the  randomized  key  matrix  to  encrypt  plain  text  file  and 
to  decrypt  cipher  text  file.  They  also  introduced  a  new 
algorithm  for  encrypting  the  plain  text  multiple  times 
increasing security by increasing system complexity.

To  insure  high  security  suitable  for  PC  applications, 
benefiting from the several methods introduced in Section 
2 above, our proposed system utilizes both cryptography 
and 
and 
steganography  are  both  exploited  as  separate  layers  to

In 

The  two-layers  system  can  be  observed  as  a  process 
flow graph (Fig. 2) clarifying the storing point of view as 
well  as  the  retrieving  point  of  view.  The  cryptography 
layer  is  using  the  well  known  standard  AES  crypto 
algorithm,  i.e.  the  sensitive  text  is  going  through  the 
symmetric key encryption using Rijndael AES algorithm. 
The  secret  key  used  in  encryption  in  the  storing  flow 
graph  is  needed  as  is  in  the  decryption  process  when 
retreiving  the  data  is  desired.  This  AES  key  can  be  of 
several  lengths,  i.e.  128, 192 and  256  bits,  which  results 
in  10,  12  and  14  rounds  of  crypto  layer  operations, 
respectively. Our system data length is fixed to 128 bits.

The crypto layer input as well as intermediate data can 
be  considered  as  a  matrix  with  four  rows  and  four 
columns  called  states.  Each  element  of  the  matrix  is 
composed  of  eight  bits.  AES  is  based  on  a  design 
principle  known  as  a  substitution-permutation  network, 
combination of both Substitution and Combination, and is 
fast in both software and hardware as explained in [9]. 

The  AES  algorithm  has  four  basic  transformations,  as 

observed in Fig. 3, described briefly as follows: 

1).  Sub  Byte  Transformation 

a  nonlinear 
transformation applied to the elements of the matrix. This 
first step in each round is a simple substitution.

2).  Shift  Rows  Transformation  -  a  cyclical  shift 
operation with constant offsets, applied to the rows of the 
matrix 

3).  Mix  Columns  Transformation  -  the  third  step  is  a 
resource intensive transformation on the columns of state 
under  which  the  four  elements  of  each  column  are 
multiplied  by  a  polynomial,  essentially  diffusing  each 
element  of  the  column  over  all  four  elements  of  that 
column. 

4). Add Round Key Transformation - performs modulo 
2 (XOR) operation with the round key, which is obtained 
from  the  initial  key  by  a  key  expansion  procedure.  The 
encryption flow starts with the addition of the initial key 
to the plaintext. Then, the iteration continues for (Nr - 1) 
rounds  (Nr  being  the  total  number  of  rounds).  In  last 
round,  the  Mix  Column  step  is  bypassed.  AES  can  be 
understood in more depth in many resources such as [10].

The steganography layer in our system is adopting the 
image based steganography as in [1] hiding the encrypted 
data coming out of the cryptography layer in the. In fact, 
we  improved  the  system  capacity  trying  to  increase  the 
hidden  bits  in  the  image  using  several  least  significant 
bits (LSBs) instead of only one as will be clarified in the 
next section.  

The main idea used in the image based steganography 
hiding  in  LSBs  can  be  explained  by  an  example  of 
embedding  the  number  200.  When  the  number  200, 
which is 11001000 in binary representation, is embedded 
into the least significant bits of the three pixels as part of 
the image, the resulting grid is as follows:  

Pixel 1: 00101101 
Pixel 2: 10100110   
Pixel 3: 11010010   

00011101 
11000101   
10101100   

11011100 
00001101 
01100011 

Notice that the LSB of the last byte of Pixel 3 is not
affected due to the completion of embedding all the secret
bits in the image; so it is kept unchanged.

sensitive  secret  text  data  message  as  the  poem  “The  cat 
 
and  the  moon”  for  William  B  Yeats  (1865-1939).  The 
algorithm  first  encrypt  the  sensitive  text  data  (the  poem) 
with the secret key “nouf” and analyze the encrypted text 
bits against the “max encrypted text char hidden”, which 
is  dependent  on  the  image  based  steganography  LSB 
technique.  The  button  “Marge  text  with  img”  cannot  be 
 
active except if the image is able to hold all the encrypted 
bits. The output of hiding the sensitive data in the 2-layer 
system  is  imbedded  into  the  cover  stego  image.  This 
hiding  process  output  stego  image  can  be  saved  within 
the PC by clicking the button “save stego image”. 
 
 
B.  Retrieving Back the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

 

 

The  interface  shown  in  Fig.  5  can  be  used  as  an 
 
example of retrieving sensitive data that was hidden using 
the 2-layer security system. By pressing the button “Text 
 
decryption”  the  program  will  operate  retrieving  back  the 
secret  sensitive  text  data.  It  starts  by  sensing  the  LSBs 
within  the  stego  image  collecting  the  bits  together 
forming  the  ciphertext.  Generating  the  ciphertext  is 
 
representing  reversing  the  stego  layer  process.  Then,  the 
ciphertext is needs the secret key as inputs to the reverse 
crypto  layer  that  decrypts  the  ciphertext  generating  back 
the  secret  sensitive  data  message,  following  Fig.  2 
process of retrieving back secret text data. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  2-layer  security  system  for  hiding  sensitive  text 
data  on  personal  computers  is  implemented  on  a  visual 
basic  programming  platform.  We  used  visual  basic 
language  Tenth  Edition  due  to  its  flexibility,  wideness 
spread, and easy to learn, such that any programmer can 
simply  find  it  and  redesign  the  system  and  verify  our 
work.  The  aim  of  this  implementation  is  to  study  the 
2-layer security system idea in depth and to test different 
situations  to  enhance  this  important  academic  research 
field.  The  implementation  is  putting  a  target  of  helping 
security  crypto  designers  and  programmers  to  improve 
our  system  idea  and  make  it  practically  usable.  Another 
interesting  feature  found  in  our  software  platform,  i.e. 
visual  basic  language  tenth  edition,  is  its  availability  of 
 
many libraries of pictures that can be taken as advantage 
 
of it in all testing experimentations. 

 
Running  the  system  implementation  begins  with  the 
 
software asking for the secret sensitive text data message 
and  the  secret  key,  which  is  representing  starting  the 
operation  of  the  crypto  layer.  Within  this  layer  process, 
the  program  converts  each  character  of  the  sensitive 
secret  text  into  an  array  of  binary  bytes  to  be  encrypted 
using  AES.  The  second  layer,  i.e.  steganography  layer, 
also asks for an RGB image as cover media, such that its 
pixels  are  also  converted  into  binary  form.  This  stego 
layer  can  start  its  process  at  the  same  time  while  crypto 
layer  is  running,  i.e.  preparing  the  image  as  binary  bits, 
but  cannot  start  hiding  data  except  after  ciphertext  is 
 
generated  from  the  crypto  layer.  Each  pixel  within  the 
RGB  image  has  3  channels,  namely  red,  green  and  blue 
(RGB)  representing  a  byte  of  8  bits  each.  Therefore, 
using  the  least  significant  bits  (LSB)  image  based 
steganography in our original system hides 3 bits in each 
 
pixel. 

 

 

A.  Hiding the Sensitive Data Example: 

 

 

The  implementation  interface  of  the  2-layer  security 
system presented is shown in Fig. 4. The interface shows 
the  bits  statistics  that  are  generated  and  used  by  the 
crypto layer and the stego layer together. The process of 
 
hiding sensitive text starting by AES encryption followed 
by  the  image  based  steganography  describes  an  example 
of hiding sensitive data in a picture as shown in Fig. 4.

To  check  for  the  system  security  of  the  stego  layer 
using  1LSB  image  based  steganography,  both  original 
and  stego  images  are  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  As 
 
observed  in  the  example  of  Fig.  6,  the  different  between 
the  original  image  and  the  Stego  image  cannot  be 
 
observed. It is so low such that no one can guess its usage 
in  the  information  hiding  process.  The  security  is  high 
because  we  just  use  the  LSB  in  hiding  information  and 
the change in image is almost unnoticeable.

V.  CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT STUDY IN THE 
STEGANOGRAPHY LAYER OF THE SYSTEM 

VI.  SYSTEM SECURITY AND DATA DEPENDENCY 

ANALYSING 1LSB VS. 2LSB 

To  study  improving  the  capacity  within  the  second 
layer  stego-images,  i.e.  when  hiding  the  encrypted 
sensitive  data  within  images,  we  tested  a  picture  hiding 
bits within different Least Significant Bits (LSB), namely 
1LSB,  2LSB,  3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB. 
These  tests  are  considered  differently  from  what  is 
presented in [16] and [17], which can be in some relation 
to  the  improvement  of  experimentations  in  [18].  In  fact, 
all  our  exploration  analysis  have  been  performed 
assuming  changing  the  bits  showing  real  interesting 
results (as shown in Fig. 7).

It  can  be  noticed  clearly  that  the  change  of  1LSB  or 
2LSB does not show difference while more than that, i.e. 
3LSB,  4LSB,  5LSB,  6LSB,  and  7LSB,  are  resulting  in 
degrading  the  pictures  quality  and  showing  distortion. 
This  capacity  study  made  the  steganography  used  in  the 
second  layer  of  our  security  system  justified  to  focus  on 
the possibility of changing the 1LSB and 2LSB only. 

Our  work  used  2LSB  image  based  steganography  in 
the  stego  layer  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  hidden 
sensitive  text.  The  capacity  within  the  stego  layer 
increased  from  3  bits/pixel  to  6  bits/pixel.  Theoretically 
the  study  of  the  security  did  not  depend  on  the 
observation  alone,  we  made  a  detailed  study  testing  the 
difference between 1LSB and 2LSB on the changed bits. 
Because  this  study  depends  heavily  on  the  data  bits 
values,  30  different  pictures  have  been  involved  as 
detailed in the next section.   

The  same  secret  sensitive  text  message,  i.e.  the  poem 
“The cat and the moon”, is used to be hidden on different 
pictures  as  first  testing  study.  Then,  the  picture  is  fixed 
and the testing tries different secret sensitive text data. 

A.  Fixing Sensitive Secret Text-Data and Changing 

Stego-images: 

In  this  test,  we  select  30  different  PC  images  (Fig.  8) 
all within same size of 332x332 pixels to be used as cover 
images for the stego layer.  

The  test  compares  adopting  the  two  acceptable  least 
signification  bit  image  based  steganography,  i.e.  1LSB 
and 2LSB. Using 1LSB for hiding the secret  message of 
7065  bits  can  hide  3444  character  in  the  image  of  size 
332 x 332.  

Using

capacity of hiding information with acceptable security.

The  security  testing  of  fixing  the  sensitive  text  to  be 
hidden and changing the pictures cover image resulted in 
changing the bits, i.e. 1LSB and 2LSB, based on the data 
used. This gives the real indication of the security of the 
system  which  can  be  dependant  completely  on  the  data 
available that cannot be expected, as shown in Fig. 9. 

 
Figure 9. Number of bits changed within the 30 pictures due to hiding 
the sensitive text with the 2-layer system utilizing 1LSB and 2LSB.  

The changed bits in Fig. 9 is comparing between using 
1LSB and 2LSB for every image. Observe that the stego 
layer  with  2LSB  is  always  giving  higher  bits  change 
compared to the 1LSB, which is expected.

We  formalized  the  security  difference  percentage 
based  on  the  bits  changed  within  every  image  based  on 
the 1LSB and 2LSB resulting the values shown in Figure 
10. These results (Fig. 10) are based on the real  security 
percentage  and  not  subject  to  personal  observations. 
Notes  that  Picture  29  is  giving  the  lowest  security 
percentage in both 1LSB and 2LSB techniques. However, 
several  pictures,  i.e.  9,  16,  18,  26,  28,  are  giving  better 
percentage  of  security  using  2LSB  compared  to  pictures 
13,  29  using  1LSB,  which  is  completely  unexpected.  In 
other words, some pictures may be giving higher security 
as  well  as  higher  capacity  when  compared  to  others, 
which  insists  on  running  the  hiding  process  on  different 
pictures and then choosing the best suitable option. 

B.  Fixing Stego-Images and Changing Sensitive Secret 

Text-Data: 

In  this  test,  we  use  the  picture  number  9  from  Fig.  8 
but  with  smaller  size  100  x  100  to  test  hiding  within  it 
two  different  sensitive  secret  messages:  sensitive  text-1 
and  sensitive  text-2.  Our  2-layer  security  system  hided 
this  text-1  and  text-2  data  both  using  the  normal  crypto 
layer  technique  and  the  steganography  layer  technique. 
However,  the  stego  layer  focuses  on  the  previously 
described  2LSB  steganography  technique.  The  sensitive 
secret text data are: 

text-1):  “The

last  prophet, 
Muhammad [peace be upon him] was born in Makkah on 
Monday, 12th Rabi al Awwal. He was born as an orphan. 
He  was  brought  up  by  his  grandfather.  His  uncle,  Abu 
Talib,  took  care  of  him  when  he  was  eight  years  old. 
When  he  was  ten  or  twelve  years  old,  he  used  to  look 
after the sheep around Makkah. 

Muhammad  was  loving,  kind,  generous,  helpful  and 
honest man. He  was an example of prefect character. He 
lived a very simple life. He was fair in his dealings  with 
all  people  whether  they  are  friends  or  enemies'  .He  was 
known as Al-Sadiq and Al-Amin. 

He was injured by Quraish but he completed his duty. 
So, we  must follow  him and interrupt all people who try 
to  deform  something  about  his  life.  And  what  happen  in 
Denmark  nowadays  is  an  example  of  this  deed.  We 
should face every person try to assault him; this is one of 
our  duties  towards  him".  This  sensitive  text-1  had  870 
characters  as  plain  text.  When  encrypted  by  the  system 
crypto  layer  the  ciphertext  generated  resulted  in  1176 
characters. 

Second  one:  (sensitive  text-2):  “Most  people  who 
bother with the matter at all would admit that the English 
language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that 
we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our 
civilization  is  decadent  and  our  language  —  so  the 
argument  runs  —  must  inevitably  share  in  the  general 
collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of 
language  is  a  sentimental  archaism,  like  preferring 
candles  to  electric  light  or  hansom  cabs  to  aeroplanes. 
Underneath 
that 
language is a natural growth and not an instrument which 
we shape for our own purposes”. This sensitive text-2 had 
601  characters  as  plain 
text.  When  encrypted  as

ciphertext resulted in 812 characters. Our 2-layer security 
system hides this text-1 data using 2LSB technique. 

Picture 9 is chosen for this test because it gave the best 
percentage  of  security  shown  in  Fig.  10.  The  two 
different sensitive texts have been hidden and the resulted 
output stego image is shown in Fig. 11. It has been notesd 
that  both  secret  text  data,  i.e.  sensitive  text-1  and 
sensitive  text-2  are  not  showing  differences  in  the 
pictures.  In  fact,  observing  these  pictures  resulted  that 
some  PC  images  may  give  similar  characteristics  when 
different  hiding  secret  texts,  but  this  needs  further 
exploration and theoretical study.

VII.  CONCLUSION 

In  this  work  we  have  shown  how  to  design  2-layer 
security system for hiding sensitive text data on personal 
computers.  We  used  cryptography  layer  to  insure  PC 
independent security and stegonagraphy layer that is fully 
dependant  on  the  PC  data  available.  The  system  is 
implemented on visual basic platform showing interesting 
results.  The  system  steganography  layer  embedded  data 
in  the  image  using  several  LSB  attempts  to  enhance 
capacity  without  degrading  security,  which  resulted  in 
accepting  the  security  of  1LSB  and  2LSB  methods.  The 
system  implementation  tested  the  relation  between  the 
data to be secured and the cover images on the PC and its 
security effects by experimenting it on 30 different fixed 
size images showing interesting attractive results.  

As  future  work,  we  want  to  improve  the  crypto  layer 
by  testing  different  other  symmetric  key  algorithms  as 
well  as  exploring  the  possibility  of  benefitting  from 
asymmetric key cryptography. We plan studying different 
ways  to  improve  the  capacity  and  the  security  of  the 
system  for  PC  applications.  We  want  to  modify  the 
method to make it supporting other languages like Arabic, 
which may need some more research.

outstanding ability to work with some databases like oracle and sql 
Nouf  research  capability  started  by  her  BS  graduation  project  about 
multimedia medical records in radiology department using techniques of 
expert  systems.  Then,  in  her  MS  studies  at  UQU,  she  worked  on 
building a program that is reconstructing permutations from differences 
sequence, which was a project related to the graduate course of analysis 
of  algorithms.  She  also  worked  as  research  assistant  in  an  official 
project within UQU that involved different computing skills. 
Nouf  research  interest  focused  lately  on  Computer  and  Information 
Security  showing  the  ability  to  integrate  cryptography,  steganography, 
networks,  artificial  Intelligence,  image  processing,  and  expert  systems, 
all from computer security point of view. She was motivated to build a 
high  2-level  security  system  for  hiding  sensitive  data  in  personal 
computers. 
 
Prof. Adnan Abdul-Aziz Gutub is currently working as the Vice Dean 
of  the  Custodian  of  the  Two  Holy  Mosques  Institute  of  the  Hajj  &

Saudi Arabia. 
Adnan  is  ranked  as  Professor  in  Computer  Engineering  specialized  in 
Information and Computer Security within UQU. He received his Ph.D. 
degree (2002) in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Oregon State 
University,  USA.  He  had  his  BS  in  Electrical  Engineering  and  MS  in 
Computer Engineering both from KFUPM, Saudi Arabia. 
Adnan's  research  interests  involved  optimizing,  modeling,  simulating, 
and  synthesizing  VLSI  hardware  for  crypto  and  security  computer 
arithmetic  operations.  He  worked  on  designing  efficient  integrated 
circuits  for  the  Montgomery  inverse  computation  in  different  finite 
fields. He has some work in modeling architectures for RSA and elliptic 
curve  crypto  operations.  His  current  interest  in  computer  security  also 
involved steganography such as image based steganography and Arabic 
text steganography.  
In  summer  2013,  Adnan  has  been  awarded  3-month  visiting  scholar 
grant in collaboration with Purdue University, West Lafayette,  Indiana, 
USA.  Previously,  Adnan  have  been  twice  awarded  the  UK  visiting 
internship  for  2  months  of  summer  2005  (at  Brunel  University)  and 
summer  2008  (at  University  of  Southampton),  both  sponsored  by  the 
British  Council  in  Saudi  Arabia.  He  had  been  involved  in  research  of 
current studies related to Arabic Text Steganography in Data Security as 
well as Elliptic Curve Crypto Processor Designs. 
Administratively,  Adnan  Gutub  filled  many  executive  and  managerial 
academic positions at KFUPM as well as UQU. At KFUPM - Dhahran, 
he had the experience of chairing the Computer Engineering department
