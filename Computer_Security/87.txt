ABSTRACT 

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming  decades has 
posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, 
and  potentially  thousands  of  tiny  sensor  nodes,  functioning  autonomously,  and  in  many  cases,  without 
access  to  renewable  energy  resources.  Cost  constraints  and  the  need  for  ubiquitous,  invisible 
deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in 
sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. We propose 
some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. Further, security being vital to the acceptance and 
use  of  sensor  networks  for  many  applications;  we  have  made  an  in  depth  threat  analysis  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network.  We  also  propose  some  countermeasures  against  these  threats  in  Wireless  Sensor 
Network.

We use the term sensor network to refer to a heterogeneous system combining tiny sensors and 
actuators  with  general  purpose  computing  elements.  The  Application  domains  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network  are  diverse  due  to  the  availability  of  micro-sensors  and  low-power  wireless 
communications. Unlike the traditional sensors, in the remote sensor network, a vast numbers of 
sensors  are  densely  deployed.  These  sensor  nodes  will  perform  significant  signal  processing, 
computation,  and  network  self-configuration  to  achieve  scalable,  robust  and  long-lived 
networks[5].  More  specifically,  sensor  nodes  will  do 
reduce 
communications,  and  consequently,  energy  costs.  We  believe  that  most  efficient  and  adaptive 
routing model for WSN is cluster based hierarchical model. For a cluster based sensor network, 
the cluster formation plays a key factor to the cost reduction, where cost refers to the expense of 
setup and maintenance of the sensor networks.

authenticity and availability. Attackers may deploy a few malicious nodes with similar hardware 
capabilities  as  the  legitimate  nodes  that  might  collude  to  attack  the  system  cooperatively.  The

compromises a node, she can extract all key material, data, and code stored on that node. While 
tamper resistance might be a viable defense for physical node compromise for some networks, 
we  do  not  see  it  as  a  general  purpose  solution.  Extremely  effective  tamper  resistance  tends  to 
add  significant  per-unit  cost,  and  sensor  nodes  are  intended  to  be  very  inexpensive  [1]  [2]  [3]

where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link

actuators  with  general  purpose  computing  elements.  The  Application  domains  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network  are  diverse  due  to  the  availability  of  micro-sensors  and  low-power  wireless 
communications. Unlike the traditional sensors, in the remote sensor network, a vast numbers of 
sensors  are  densely  deployed.  These  sensor  nodes  will  perform  significant  signal  processing, 
computation,  and  network  self-configuration  to  achieve  scalable,  robust  and  long-lived 
networks[5].  More  specifically,  sensor  nodes  will  do 
reduce 
communications,  and  consequently,  energy  costs.  We  believe  that  most  efficient  and  adaptive 
routing model for WSN is cluster based hierarchical model. For a cluster based sensor network, 
the cluster formation plays a key factor to the cost reduction, where cost refers to the expense of 
setup and maintenance of the sensor networks.

measures. 

2. WSN ARCHITECTURE 

In a typical WSN we see following network components –  

•  Sensor  motes  (Field  devices)  –  Field  devices  are  mounted  in  the  process  and  must  be 
capable of routing packets on behalf of other devices. In most cases they characterize or 
control the process or process equipment. A router is a special type of field device that 
does not have process sensor or control equipment and as such does not interface with 
the process itself.

•  Gateway  or  Access  points  –  A  Gateway  enables  communication  between  Host 

application and field devices. 

•  Network  manager  –  A  Network  Manager  is  responsible  for  configuration  of  the 
network,  scheduling  communication  between  devices  (i.e.,  configuring  super  frames), 
management  of  the  routing  tables  and  monitoring  and  reporting  the  health  of  the 
network. 

•  Security manager – The Security Manager is responsible for the generation, storage, and 

management of keys.

3. WSN SECURITY ANALYSIS 

Simplicity in Wireless Sensor Network with resource constrained nodes makes them extremely 
vulnerable to variety of attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits 
in the channel, replay previously heard packets  and  many more. Securing  the  Wireless Sensor 
Network  needs  to  make  the  network  support  all  security  properties:  confidentiality,  integrity, 
authenticity and availability. Attackers may deploy a few malicious nodes with similar hardware 
capabilities  as  the  legitimate  nodes  that  might  collude  to  attack  the  system  cooperatively.  The 
attacker may come upon these malicious nodes by purchasing them separately, or by "turning" a 
few  legitimate  nodes  by  capturing  them  and  physically  overwriting  their  memory.    Also,  in 
some  cases  colluding  nodes  might  have  high-quality  communications  links  available  for 
coordinating  their  attack.  Sensor  nodes  may  not  be  tamper  resistant  and  if  an  adversary 
compromises a node, she can extract all key material, data, and code stored on that node. While 
tamper resistance might be a viable defense for physical node compromise for some networks, 
we  do  not  see  it  as  a  general  purpose  solution.  Extremely  effective  tamper  resistance  tends  to 
add  significant  per-unit  cost,  and  sensor  nodes  are  intended  to  be  very  inexpensive  [1]  [2]  [3] 
[4]. 

We identify and categorize attacks in Wireless Sensor Network as follows: 

3.1. Denial of Service 

Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  is  any  event  that  diminishes  or  eliminates  a  network's  capacity  to 
perform its expected function [16]. 

 

2 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Attack 3.1 DoS/Physical Layer/Jamming. Jamming. To jam a node or set of nodes, in this case, 
this is simply the transmission of a radio signal that interferes with the radio frequencies being 
used by the sensor network. Jamming the channel with an interrupting signal. 

Attack  3.2  DoS/Physical  Layer/Tampering.  Physical  Tampering.  Nodes  are  vulnerable  to 
physical harm, or tampering (i.e. reverse engineering). 

Attack 3.3 DoS/Data Link Layer/Collision. 

Attack 3.4 DoS/Data Link Layer/Exhaustion. 

Attack 3.5 DoS/Data Link Layer/Unfairness. 

Attack 3.6 DoS/Network Layer/Neglect and Greed. 

Attack 3.7 DoS/Network Layer/Homing. 

Attack 3.8 DoS/Network Layer/Spoofing. Misdirection. In this type of attack adversaries may 
be able to create routing loops, attract or repel network traffic, extend or shorten source routes, 
generate false error messages, partition the network, increase end-to-end latency, etc. 

Attack 3.9 DoS/Network Layer/Black Holes. 

Attack 3.10 DoS/Network Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.11 DoS/Transport Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.12 DoS/Transport Layer/De-synchronization. 

3.2. Interrogation 

Attack 3.13 Interrogation/Data Link Layer. 

3.3. Sybil 

Sybil attack is defined as a "malicious device illegitimately taking on multiple identities". Using 
the  Sybil  attack  [7],  an  adversary  can  "be  in  more  than  one  place  at  once"  as  a  single  node 
presents  multiple  identities  to  other  nodes  in  the  network  which  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  fault  tolerant  schemes  such  as  distributed  storage  [8],  dispersity  [9]  and 
multipath. It may be extremely difficult for an adversary to launch such an attack in a network 
where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or 
spread  spectrum  communication.  Sybil  attacks  also  pose  a  significant  threat  to  geographic 
routing protocols. 

Attack 3.14 Sybil/Physical Layer. 

Attack 3.15 Sybil/Data Link Layer/Data Aggregation. 

Attack  3.16  Sybil/Data  Link  Layer/Voting.  Stuffing  the  ballot  box  of  a  voting  scheme,  for 
example. 

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link 

 

4 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

acknowledgments  for  "overheard"  packets  addressed  to  neighboring  nodes.  Goals  include 
convincing the sender that a weak link is strong or that a dead or disabled node is alive. 

Attack 3.23 Acknowledgement spoofing. 

3.10. Cloning 

Attack 3.24 Cloning/Application Layer. 

3.11. Impersonation 

Attack 3.25 Node Replication. Also called Multiple Identity, Impersonation. An attacker seeks 
to add a node to an existing sensor network by copying (replicating) the node ID of an existing 
sensor node. Node replication attacks can occur if an adversary can copy the node identification 
of a network node. In this manner packets could be corrupted, misrouted or deleted, and if this 
adversary  could  perform  this  replication  it  is  possible  that  cryptographic  keys  could  be 
disclosed. 

3.12. Eavesdropping 

Attack  3.26  Monitor  and  eavesdropping.  Also  called  confidentiality.  By  listening  to  the  data, 
the  adversary  could  easily  discover  the  communication  contents.  Network  traffic  is  also 
susceptible  to  monitoring  and  eavesdropping.  This  should  be  no  cause  for  concern  given  a 
robust  security  protocol,  but  monitoring  could  lead  to  attacks  similar  to  those  previously 
described. It could also lead to wormhole or black hole attacks. 

3.13. Traffic Analysis 

Attack  3.27  Traffic  Analyses.  Traffic  analysis  attacks  are  forged  where  the  base  station  is 
determinable by observation that the majority of packets are being routed to one particular node. 
If an adversary can compromise the base station then it can render the network useless. 

3.14. Mote Class 

Also called Insider Attacks. The attackers have an authorized participant in the sensor network. 
Insider attacks may be mounted from either compromised sensor nodes running malicious code 
or adversaries who have stolen the key material, code, and data from legitimate nodes, and who 
then  use  one  or  more  laptop-class  devices  to  attack  the  network.  Mote-class  attacker  [6]  has 
access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own, but not much more than this. 
Using  ordinary  sensors  attacker  might  only  be  able  to  jam  the  radio  link  in  its  immediate 
vicinity. 

Attack  3.28  Mote-class/Control  of  Sensor  Node.  Malicious  programs,  access  cryptographic 
keys. 

3.15. Invasive 

Attack  3.29  Invasive.  Reverse  engineering,  probing.  Extract  keys,  new  code,  software 
vulnerabilities. 

3.16. Non-Invasive 

Attack  3.30  Non-Invasive.  Mote  not  physically  tampered.  Side-channel  attacks  –  Differential 
power analysis. 

3.17. Laptop Class

ABSTRACT 

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming  decades has 
posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, 
and  potentially  thousands  of  tiny  sensor  nodes,  functioning  autonomously,  and  in  many  cases,  without 
access  to  renewable  energy  resources.  Cost  constraints  and  the  need  for  ubiquitous,  invisible 
deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in 
sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. We propose 
some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. Further, security being vital to the acceptance and 
use  of  sensor  networks  for  many  applications;  we  have  made  an  in  depth  threat  analysis  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network.  We  also  propose  some  countermeasures  against  these  threats  in  Wireless  Sensor 
Network.

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Also called Outsider Attacks. The attacker has no special access to the sensor network. Laptop 
class attacker may have access to more powerful devices, like laptops or their equivalent which 
supersede the legitimate nodes when deployed for action: they may have greater battery power, 
a  more  capable  CPU,  a  high-power  radio  transmitter,  or  a  sensitive  antenna.  Laptop-class 
attacker might be able to jam the entire sensor network using its stronger transmitter. A single 
laptop-class  attacker  might  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  an  entire  network.  Also,  laptop-class 
attackers  might  have  a  high  bandwidth,  low-latency  communications  channel  not  available  to

4. COUNTER MEASURES 

In this section, we discuss some of the counter measures. 

4.1. Outsider attacks and link layer security 

The majority  of outsider  attacks  against sensor network routing protocols can be prevented by 
simple  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  using  a  globally  shared  key.  Major  classes  of 
attacks  not  countered  by  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  mechanisms  are  wormhole 
attacks and HELLO flood attacks because, although an adversary is prevented from joining the 
network, nothing prevents her from using a wormhole to tunnel packets sent by legitimate nodes 
in  one  part  of  the  network  to  legitimate  nodes  in  another  part  to  convince  them  they  are 
neighbors or by amplifying an overheard broadcast packet with sufficient power to be received 
by every node in the network. 

Link  layer  security  mechanisms  using  a  globally  shared  key  are  completely  ineffective  in 
presence of insider attacks or compromised nodes. Insiders can attack the network by spoofing 
or injecting bogus routing information, creating sinkholes, selectively forwarding packets, using 
the Sybil attack, and broadcasting HELLO floods. More sophisticated defense mechanisms are 
needed  to  provide  reasonable  protection  against  wormholes  and  insider  attacks.  We  focus  on 
countermeasures against these attacks in the remaining sections. 

4.2. The Sybil attacks 

An insider cannot be prevented from participating in the network, but she should only be able to 
do so using the identities of the nodes she has compromised. Using a globally shared key allows 
an insider to masquerade as any (possibly even nonexistent) node. Identities must be verified. In 
the  traditional  setting,  this  might  be  done  using  public  key  cryptography,  but  generating  and 
verifying digital signatures is beyond the capabilities  of  sensor nodes.  One  solution is to have 
every node share a unique symmetric key with a trusted base station. Two nodes can then use a

ABSTRACT 

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming  decades has 
posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, 
and  potentially  thousands  of  tiny  sensor  nodes,  functioning  autonomously,  and  in  many  cases,  without 
access  to  renewable  energy  resources.  Cost  constraints  and  the  need  for  ubiquitous,  invisible 
deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in 
sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. We propose 
some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. Further, security being vital to the acceptance and 
use  of  sensor  networks  for  many  applications;  we  have  made  an  in  depth  threat  analysis  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network.  We  also  propose  some  countermeasures  against  these  threats  in  Wireless  Sensor

We use the term sensor network to refer to a heterogeneous system combining tiny sensors and 
actuators  with  general  purpose  computing  elements.  The  Application  domains  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network  are  diverse  due  to  the  availability  of  micro-sensors  and  low-power  wireless 
communications. Unlike the traditional sensors, in the remote sensor network, a vast numbers of 
sensors  are  densely  deployed.  These  sensor  nodes  will  perform  significant  signal  processing, 
computation,  and  network  self-configuration  to  achieve  scalable,  robust  and  long-lived 
networks[5].  More  specifically,  sensor  nodes  will  do 
reduce 
communications,  and  consequently,  energy  costs.  We  believe  that  most  efficient  and  adaptive 
routing model for WSN is cluster based hierarchical model. For a cluster based sensor network,

•  Sensor  motes  (Field  devices)  –  Field  devices  are  mounted  in  the  process  and  must  be 
capable of routing packets on behalf of other devices. In most cases they characterize or 
control the process or process equipment. A router is a special type of field device that 
does not have process sensor or control equipment and as such does not interface with

3. WSN SECURITY ANALYSIS 

Simplicity in Wireless Sensor Network with resource constrained nodes makes them extremely 
vulnerable to variety of attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits 
in the channel, replay previously heard packets  and  many more. Securing  the  Wireless Sensor 
Network  needs  to  make  the  network  support  all  security  properties:  confidentiality,  integrity, 
authenticity and availability. Attackers may deploy a few malicious nodes with similar hardware 
capabilities  as  the  legitimate  nodes  that  might  collude  to  attack  the  system  cooperatively.  The 
attacker may come upon these malicious nodes by purchasing them separately, or by "turning" a 
few  legitimate  nodes  by  capturing  them  and  physically  overwriting  their  memory.    Also,  in 
some  cases  colluding  nodes  might  have  high-quality  communications  links  available  for 
coordinating  their  attack.  Sensor  nodes  may  not  be  tamper  resistant  and  if  an  adversary 
compromises a node, she can extract all key material, data, and code stored on that node. While 
tamper resistance might be a viable defense for physical node compromise for some networks, 
we  do  not  see  it  as  a  general  purpose  solution.  Extremely  effective  tamper  resistance  tends  to 
add  significant  per-unit  cost,  and  sensor  nodes  are  intended  to  be  very  inexpensive  [1]  [2]  [3] 
[4]. 

We identify and categorize attacks in Wireless Sensor Network as follows: 

3.1. Denial of Service 

Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  is  any  event  that  diminishes  or  eliminates  a  network's  capacity  to 
perform its expected function [16]. 

 

2 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Attack 3.1 DoS/Physical Layer/Jamming. Jamming. To jam a node or set of nodes, in this case, 
this is simply the transmission of a radio signal that interferes with the radio frequencies being 
used by the sensor network. Jamming the channel with an interrupting signal. 

Attack  3.2  DoS/Physical  Layer/Tampering.  Physical  Tampering.  Nodes  are  vulnerable  to 
physical harm, or tampering (i.e. reverse engineering). 

Attack 3.3 DoS/Data Link Layer/Collision. 

Attack 3.4 DoS/Data Link Layer/Exhaustion. 

Attack 3.5 DoS/Data Link Layer/Unfairness. 

Attack 3.6 DoS/Network Layer/Neglect and Greed. 

Attack 3.7 DoS/Network Layer/Homing. 

Attack 3.8 DoS/Network Layer/Spoofing. Misdirection. In this type of attack adversaries may 
be able to create routing loops, attract or repel network traffic, extend or shorten source routes, 
generate false error messages, partition the network, increase end-to-end latency, etc. 

Attack 3.9 DoS/Network Layer/Black Holes. 

Attack 3.10 DoS/Network Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.11 DoS/Transport Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.12 DoS/Transport Layer/De-synchronization. 

3.2. Interrogation 

Attack 3.13 Interrogation/Data Link Layer. 

3.3. Sybil 

Sybil attack is defined as a "malicious device illegitimately taking on multiple identities". Using 
the  Sybil  attack  [7],  an  adversary  can  "be  in  more  than  one  place  at  once"  as  a  single  node 
presents  multiple  identities  to  other  nodes  in  the  network  which  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  fault  tolerant  schemes  such  as  distributed  storage  [8],  dispersity  [9]  and 
multipath. It may be extremely difficult for an adversary to launch such an attack in a network 
where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or 
spread  spectrum  communication.  Sybil  attacks  also  pose  a  significant  threat  to  geographic 
routing protocols. 

Attack 3.14 Sybil/Physical Layer. 

Attack 3.15 Sybil/Data Link Layer/Data Aggregation. 

Attack  3.16  Sybil/Data  Link  Layer/Voting.  Stuffing  the  ballot  box  of  a  voting  scheme,  for 
example. 

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link 

 

4 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

acknowledgments  for  "overheard"  packets  addressed  to  neighboring  nodes.  Goals  include 
convincing the sender that a weak link is strong or that a dead or disabled node is alive. 

Attack 3.23 Acknowledgement spoofing. 

3.10. Cloning 

Attack 3.24 Cloning/Application Layer. 

3.11. Impersonation 

Attack 3.25 Node Replication. Also called Multiple Identity, Impersonation. An attacker seeks 
to add a node to an existing sensor network by copying (replicating) the node ID of an existing 
sensor node. Node replication attacks can occur if an adversary can copy the node identification 
of a network node. In this manner packets could be corrupted, misrouted or deleted, and if this 
adversary  could  perform  this  replication  it  is  possible  that  cryptographic  keys  could  be 
disclosed. 

3.12. Eavesdropping 

Attack  3.26  Monitor  and  eavesdropping.  Also  called  confidentiality.  By  listening  to  the  data, 
the  adversary  could  easily  discover  the  communication  contents.  Network  traffic  is  also 
susceptible  to  monitoring  and  eavesdropping.  This  should  be  no  cause  for  concern  given  a 
robust  security  protocol,  but  monitoring  could  lead  to  attacks  similar  to  those  previously 
described. It could also lead to wormhole or black hole attacks. 

3.13. Traffic Analysis 

Attack  3.27  Traffic  Analyses.  Traffic  analysis  attacks  are  forged  where  the  base  station  is 
determinable by observation that the majority of packets are being routed to one particular node. 
If an adversary can compromise the base station then it can render the network useless. 

3.14. Mote Class 

Also called Insider Attacks. The attackers have an authorized participant in the sensor network. 
Insider attacks may be mounted from either compromised sensor nodes running malicious code 
or adversaries who have stolen the key material, code, and data from legitimate nodes, and who 
then  use  one  or  more  laptop-class  devices  to  attack  the  network.  Mote-class  attacker  [6]  has 
access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own, but not much more than this. 
Using  ordinary  sensors  attacker  might  only  be  able  to  jam  the  radio  link  in  its  immediate 
vicinity. 

Attack  3.28  Mote-class/Control  of  Sensor  Node.  Malicious  programs,  access  cryptographic 
keys. 

3.15. Invasive 

Attack  3.29  Invasive.  Reverse  engineering,  probing.  Extract  keys,  new  code,  software 
vulnerabilities. 

3.16. Non-Invasive 

Attack  3.30  Non-Invasive.  Mote  not  physically  tampered.  Side-channel  attacks  –  Differential 
power analysis. 

3.17. Laptop Class 

 

5 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Also called Outsider Attacks. The attacker has no special access to the sensor network. Laptop 
class attacker may have access to more powerful devices, like laptops or their equivalent which 
supersede the legitimate nodes when deployed for action: they may have greater battery power, 
a  more  capable  CPU,  a  high-power  radio  transmitter,  or  a  sensitive  antenna.  Laptop-class 
attacker might be able to jam the entire sensor network using its stronger transmitter. A single 
laptop-class  attacker  might  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  an  entire  network.  Also,  laptop-class 
attackers  might  have  a  high  bandwidth,  low-latency  communications  channel  not  available  to 
ordinary sensor nodes, allowing such attackers to coordinate their efforts. 

Attack 3.31 Laptop-class/Passive Eavesdropping. 

Attack 3.32 Laptop-class/Traffic Injection. 

3.18. Attack on Protocols 

Attack 3.33 Key Management. 

Attack 3.34 Reputation Assignment Scheme. 

Attack 3.35 Data Aggregation. 

Attack 3.36 Time Synchronization. 

Attack 3.37 Intrusion Detection Systems. 

4. COUNTER MEASURES 

In this section, we discuss some of the counter measures. 

4.1. Outsider attacks and link layer security 

The majority  of outsider  attacks  against sensor network routing protocols can be prevented by 
simple  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  using  a  globally  shared  key.  Major  classes  of 
attacks  not  countered  by  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  mechanisms  are  wormhole 
attacks and HELLO flood attacks because, although an adversary is prevented from joining the 
network, nothing prevents her from using a wormhole to tunnel packets sent by legitimate nodes 
in  one  part  of  the  network  to  legitimate  nodes  in  another  part  to  convince  them  they  are 
neighbors or by amplifying an overheard broadcast packet with sufficient power to be received 
by every node in the network. 

Link  layer  security  mechanisms  using  a  globally  shared  key  are  completely  ineffective  in 
presence of insider attacks or compromised nodes. Insiders can attack the network by spoofing 
or injecting bogus routing information, creating sinkholes, selectively forwarding packets, using 
the Sybil attack, and broadcasting HELLO floods. More sophisticated defense mechanisms are 
needed  to  provide  reasonable  protection  against  wormholes  and  insider  attacks.  We  focus  on 
countermeasures against these attacks in the remaining sections. 

4.2. The Sybil attacks 

An insider cannot be prevented from participating in the network, but she should only be able to 
do so using the identities of the nodes she has compromised. Using a globally shared key allows 
an insider to masquerade as any (possibly even nonexistent) node. Identities must be verified. In 
the  traditional  setting,  this  might  be  done  using  public  key  cryptography,  but  generating  and 
verifying digital signatures is beyond the capabilities  of  sensor nodes.  One  solution is to have 
every node share a unique symmetric key with a trusted base station. Two nodes can then use a 

 

6 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Needham-Schroeder  like  protocol to  verify  each  other's  identity  and  establish  a  shared  key.  A 
pair  of  neighboring  nodes  can  use  the  resulting  key  to  implement  an  authenticated,  encrypted 
link between them. In order to prevent an insider from wandering around a stationary network 
and  establishing  shared  keys  with  every  node  in  the  network,  the  base  station  can  reasonably 
limit the number of neighbors a node is allowed to have and send an error message when a node 
exceeds it. Thus, when a node is compromised, it is restricted to (meaningfully) communicating 
only  with  its  verified  neighbors.  This  is  not  to  say  that  nodes  are  forbidden  from  sending 
messages to base stations or aggregation points multiple hops away, but they are restricted from 
using any node except their verified neighbors to do so. In addition, an adversary can still use a 
wormhole  to  create  an  artificial  link between  two  nodes  to  convince  them  they  are  neighbors, 
but  the  adversary  will  not  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  or  modify  any  future  communications 
between them. 

4.3. HELLO flood attacks 

The  simplest  defense  against  HELLO  flood  attacks  is  to  verify  the  bi  directionality  of  a  link 
before  taking  meaningful  action  based  on  a  message  received  over  that  link.  The  identity 
verification protocol is  sufficient to  prevent HELLO  flood attacks. Not only  does  it  verify  the 
bidirectional link between two nodes, but even if a well-funded adversary had a highly sensitive 
receiver  or  had  wormholes  to  a  multiple  locations  in  the  network,  a  trusted  base  station  that 
limits the number of verified neighbors for each node will still prevent HELLO flood attacks on 
large segments of the network when a small number of nodes have been compromised. 

4.4. Wormhole and Sinkhole attacks 

Wormhole and sinkhole attacks are very difficult to defend against, especially when the two are 
used  in  combination.  Wormholes  are  hard  to  detect  because  they  use  a  private,  out-of-band 
channel invisible to the underlying sensor network. Sinkholes are difficult to defend against in 
protocols that use advertised information such as remaining energy or an estimate of end-to-end 
reliability to construct a routing topology because this information is hard to verify. Routes that 
minimize  the  hop-count  to  a  base  station  are  easier  to  verify,  however  hop-count  can  be 
completely  misrepresented  through  a  wormhole.  When  routes  are  established  simply  based  on 
the  reception  of  a  packet  as  in  TinyOS  beaconing  or  directed  diffusion,  sinkholes  are  easy  to 
create  because  there  is  no  information  for  a  defender  to  verify.  A  technique  for  detecting 
wormhole attacks is presented in [10], but it requires extremely tight time synchronization and 
is thus infeasible for most sensor networks. Because it is extremely difficult to retrofit existing 
protocols  with  defenses  against  these  attacks,  the  best  solution  is  to  carefully  design  routing 
protocols in which wormholes and sinkholes are meaningless. 

4.5. Leveraging Global Knowledge 

A  significant  challenge  in  securing  large  sensor  networks  is  their  inherent  self  organizing, 
decentralized  nature.  When  the  network  size  is  limited  or  the  topology  is  well  structured  or 
controlled,  global  knowledge  can  be  leveraged  in  security  mechanisms.  Consider  a  relatively 
small network of around 100 nodes or less. If it can be assumed that no nodes are compromised 
during deployment, then after the initial topology is formed, each node could send information 
such as neighboring nodes and its geographic location (if known) back to a base station. Using 
this information, the base station(s) can map the topology of the entire network. To account for 
topology  changes  due  to  radio interference  or  node  failure,  nodes  would periodically  update  a 
base  station  with  the  appropriate  information.  Drastic  or  suspicious  changes  to  the  topology 
might indicate a node compromise, and the appropriate action can be taken. We have discussed 
why geographic routing can be relatively secure against wormhole, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, 
but the main remaining problem is that location information advertised from neighboring nodes 
must  be  trusted.  A  compromised  node  advertising  its  location  on  a  line  between  the  targeted

Simplicity in Wireless Sensor Network with resource constrained nodes makes them extremely 
vulnerable to variety of attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits

Attack 3.5 DoS/Data Link Layer/Unfairness. 

Attack 3.6 DoS/Network Layer/Neglect and Greed. 

Attack 3.7 DoS/Network Layer/Homing. 

Attack 3.8 DoS/Network Layer/Spoofing. Misdirection. In this type of attack adversaries may 
be able to create routing loops, attract or repel network traffic, extend or shorten source routes, 
generate false error messages, partition the network, increase end-to-end latency, etc.

3.2. Interrogation 

Attack 3.13 Interrogation/Data Link Layer. 

3.3. Sybil 

Sybil attack is defined as a "malicious device illegitimately taking on multiple identities". Using 
the  Sybil  attack  [7],  an  adversary  can  "be  in  more  than  one  place  at  once"  as  a  single  node 
presents  multiple  identities  to  other  nodes  in  the  network  which  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  fault  tolerant  schemes  such  as  distributed  storage  [8],  dispersity  [9]  and 
multipath. It may be extremely difficult for an adversary to launch such an attack in a network 
where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or 
spread  spectrum  communication.  Sybil  attacks  also  pose  a  significant  threat  to  geographic 
routing protocols. 

Attack 3.14 Sybil/Physical Layer. 

Attack 3.15 Sybil/Data Link Layer/Data Aggregation. 

Attack  3.16  Sybil/Data  Link  Layer/Voting.  Stuffing  the  ballot  box  of  a  voting  scheme,  for 
example. 

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link 

 

4 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

acknowledgments  for  "overheard"  packets  addressed  to  neighboring  nodes.  Goals  include 
convincing the sender that a weak link is strong or that a dead or disabled node is alive. 

Attack 3.23 Acknowledgement spoofing. 

3.10. Cloning 

Attack 3.24 Cloning/Application Layer. 

3.11. Impersonation 

Attack 3.25 Node Replication. Also called Multiple Identity, Impersonation. An attacker seeks 
to add a node to an existing sensor network by copying (replicating) the node ID of an existing 
sensor node. Node replication attacks can occur if an adversary can copy the node identification 
of a network node. In this manner packets could be corrupted, misrouted or deleted, and if this 
adversary  could  perform  this  replication  it  is  possible  that  cryptographic  keys  could  be 
disclosed. 

3.12. Eavesdropping 

Attack  3.26  Monitor  and  eavesdropping.  Also  called  confidentiality.  By  listening  to  the  data, 
the  adversary  could  easily  discover  the  communication  contents.  Network  traffic  is  also 
susceptible  to  monitoring  and  eavesdropping.  This  should  be  no  cause  for  concern  given  a 
robust  security  protocol,  but  monitoring  could  lead  to  attacks  similar  to  those  previously 
described. It could also lead to wormhole or black hole attacks. 

3.13. Traffic Analysis 

Attack  3.27  Traffic  Analyses.  Traffic  analysis  attacks  are  forged  where  the  base  station  is 
determinable by observation that the majority of packets are being routed to one particular node. 
If an adversary can compromise the base station then it can render the network useless. 

3.14. Mote Class 

Also called Insider Attacks. The attackers have an authorized participant in the sensor network. 
Insider attacks may be mounted from either compromised sensor nodes running malicious code 
or adversaries who have stolen the key material, code, and data from legitimate nodes, and who 
then  use  one  or  more  laptop-class  devices  to  attack  the  network.  Mote-class  attacker  [6]  has 
access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own, but not much more than this. 
Using  ordinary  sensors  attacker  might  only  be  able  to  jam  the  radio  link  in  its  immediate 
vicinity. 

Attack  3.28  Mote-class/Control  of  Sensor  Node.  Malicious  programs,  access  cryptographic 
keys. 

3.15. Invasive 

Attack  3.29  Invasive.  Reverse  engineering,  probing.  Extract  keys,  new  code,  software 
vulnerabilities. 

3.16. Non-Invasive 

Attack  3.30  Non-Invasive.  Mote  not  physically  tampered.  Side-channel  attacks  –  Differential 
power analysis. 

3.17. Laptop Class 

 

5 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Also called Outsider Attacks. The attacker has no special access to the sensor network. Laptop 
class attacker may have access to more powerful devices, like laptops or their equivalent which 
supersede the legitimate nodes when deployed for action: they may have greater battery power, 
a  more  capable  CPU,  a  high-power  radio  transmitter,  or  a  sensitive  antenna.  Laptop-class 
attacker might be able to jam the entire sensor network using its stronger transmitter. A single 
laptop-class  attacker  might  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  an  entire  network.  Also,  laptop-class 
attackers  might  have  a  high  bandwidth,  low-latency  communications  channel  not  available  to 
ordinary sensor nodes, allowing such attackers to coordinate their efforts. 

Attack 3.31 Laptop-class/Passive Eavesdropping. 

Attack 3.32 Laptop-class/Traffic Injection. 

3.18. Attack on Protocols 

Attack 3.33 Key Management. 

Attack 3.34 Reputation Assignment Scheme. 

Attack 3.35 Data Aggregation. 

Attack 3.36 Time Synchronization. 

Attack 3.37 Intrusion Detection Systems. 

4. COUNTER MEASURES 

In this section, we discuss some of the counter measures. 

4.1. Outsider attacks and link layer security 

The majority  of outsider  attacks  against sensor network routing protocols can be prevented by 
simple  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  using  a  globally  shared  key.  Major  classes  of 
attacks  not  countered  by  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  mechanisms  are  wormhole 
attacks and HELLO flood attacks because, although an adversary is prevented from joining the 
network, nothing prevents her from using a wormhole to tunnel packets sent by legitimate nodes 
in  one  part  of  the  network  to  legitimate  nodes  in  another  part  to  convince  them  they  are 
neighbors or by amplifying an overheard broadcast packet with sufficient power to be received 
by every node in the network. 

Link  layer  security  mechanisms  using  a  globally  shared  key  are  completely  ineffective  in 
presence of insider attacks or compromised nodes. Insiders can attack the network by spoofing 
or injecting bogus routing information, creating sinkholes, selectively forwarding packets, using 
the Sybil attack, and broadcasting HELLO floods. More sophisticated defense mechanisms are 
needed  to  provide  reasonable  protection  against  wormholes  and  insider  attacks.  We  focus  on 
countermeasures against these attacks in the remaining sections. 

4.2. The Sybil attacks 

An insider cannot be prevented from participating in the network, but she should only be able to 
do so using the identities of the nodes she has compromised. Using a globally shared key allows 
an insider to masquerade as any (possibly even nonexistent) node. Identities must be verified. In 
the  traditional  setting,  this  might  be  done  using  public  key  cryptography,  but  generating  and 
verifying digital signatures is beyond the capabilities  of  sensor nodes.  One  solution is to have 
every node share a unique symmetric key with a trusted base station. Two nodes can then use a 

 

6 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Needham-Schroeder  like  protocol to  verify  each  other's  identity  and  establish  a  shared  key.  A 
pair  of  neighboring  nodes  can  use  the  resulting  key  to  implement  an  authenticated,  encrypted 
link between them. In order to prevent an insider from wandering around a stationary network 
and  establishing  shared  keys  with  every  node  in  the  network,  the  base  station  can  reasonably 
limit the number of neighbors a node is allowed to have and send an error message when a node 
exceeds it. Thus, when a node is compromised, it is restricted to (meaningfully) communicating 
only  with  its  verified  neighbors.  This  is  not  to  say  that  nodes  are  forbidden  from  sending 
messages to base stations or aggregation points multiple hops away, but they are restricted from 
using any node except their verified neighbors to do so. In addition, an adversary can still use a 
wormhole  to  create  an  artificial  link between  two  nodes  to  convince  them  they  are  neighbors, 
but  the  adversary  will  not  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  or  modify  any  future  communications 
between them. 

4.3. HELLO flood attacks 

The  simplest  defense  against  HELLO  flood  attacks  is  to  verify  the  bi  directionality  of  a  link 
before  taking  meaningful  action  based  on  a  message  received  over  that  link.  The  identity 
verification protocol is  sufficient to  prevent HELLO  flood attacks. Not only  does  it  verify  the 
bidirectional link between two nodes, but even if a well-funded adversary had a highly sensitive 
receiver  or  had  wormholes  to  a  multiple  locations  in  the  network,  a  trusted  base  station  that 
limits the number of verified neighbors for each node will still prevent HELLO flood attacks on 
large segments of the network when a small number of nodes have been compromised. 

4.4. Wormhole and Sinkhole attacks 

Wormhole and sinkhole attacks are very difficult to defend against, especially when the two are 
used  in  combination.  Wormholes  are  hard  to  detect  because  they  use  a  private,  out-of-band 
channel invisible to the underlying sensor network. Sinkholes are difficult to defend against in 
protocols that use advertised information such as remaining energy or an estimate of end-to-end 
reliability to construct a routing topology because this information is hard to verify. Routes that 
minimize  the  hop-count  to  a  base  station  are  easier  to  verify,  however  hop-count  can  be 
completely  misrepresented  through  a  wormhole.  When  routes  are  established  simply  based  on 
the  reception  of  a  packet  as  in  TinyOS  beaconing  or  directed  diffusion,  sinkholes  are  easy  to 
create  because  there  is  no  information  for  a  defender  to  verify.  A  technique  for  detecting 
wormhole attacks is presented in [10], but it requires extremely tight time synchronization and 
is thus infeasible for most sensor networks. Because it is extremely difficult to retrofit existing 
protocols  with  defenses  against  these  attacks,  the  best  solution  is  to  carefully  design  routing 
protocols in which wormholes and sinkholes are meaningless. 

4.5. Leveraging Global Knowledge 

A  significant  challenge  in  securing  large  sensor  networks  is  their  inherent  self  organizing, 
decentralized  nature.  When  the  network  size  is  limited  or  the  topology  is  well  structured  or 
controlled,  global  knowledge  can  be  leveraged  in  security  mechanisms.  Consider  a  relatively 
small network of around 100 nodes or less. If it can be assumed that no nodes are compromised 
during deployment, then after the initial topology is formed, each node could send information 
such as neighboring nodes and its geographic location (if known) back to a base station. Using 
this information, the base station(s) can map the topology of the entire network. To account for 
topology  changes  due  to  radio interference  or  node  failure,  nodes  would periodically  update  a 
base  station  with  the  appropriate  information.  Drastic  or  suspicious  changes  to  the  topology 
might indicate a node compromise, and the appropriate action can be taken. We have discussed 
why geographic routing can be relatively secure against wormhole, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, 
but the main remaining problem is that location information advertised from neighboring nodes 
must  be  trusted.  A  compromised  node  advertising  its  location  on  a  line  between  the  targeted 

 

7 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

node and a base station will guarantee it is  the destination for all forwarded packets from that 
node.  Probabilistic  selection  of  a  next  hop  from  several  acceptable  destinations  or  multipath 
routing to multiple base stations can help with this problem, but it is not perfect. When a node 
must route around a "hole", an adversary can "help" by appearing to be the only reasonable node 
to  forward  packets  to.  Sufficiently  restricting  the  structure  of  the  topology  can  eliminate  the 
requirement for nodes to advertise their locations if all nodes' locations are well known. 

4.6. Selective forwarding 

Even  in  protocols  completely  resistant  to  sinkholes,  wormholes,  and  the  Sybil  attack,  a 
compromised  node  has  a  significant  probability  of  including  itself  on  a  data  flow  to  launch  a 
selective  forwarding  attack  if  it  is  strategically  located  near  the  source  or  a  base  station. 
Multipath routing can be used to counter these types of selective forwarding attacks. Messages 
routed  over  paths  whose  nodes  are  completely  disjoint  are  completely  protected  against 
selective  forwarding  attacks  involving  at  most  compromised  nodes  and  still  offer  some 
probabilistic protection whenever nodes are compromised. However, completely disjoint paths 
may be difficult to create. Braided paths [11] may have nodes in common, but have no links in 
common  (i.e.,  no  two  consecutive  nodes  in  common).  The  use  of  multiple  braided  paths  may 
provide probabilistic protection against selective forwarding and use only localized information. 
Allowing  nodes  to  dynamically  choose  a  packet's  next  hop  probabilistically  from  a  set  of 
possible candidates can further reduce the chances of an adversary gaining complete control of a 
data flow. 

4.7. Authenticated broadcast and flooding 

If we have base stations trustworthy, adversaries must not be able to spoof broadcast or flooded 
messages from any base station. This requires some level of asymmetry: since every node in the 
network can potentially be compromised, no node should be able to spoof messages from a base 
station, yet every node should be able to verify them. Authenticated broadcast is also useful for 
localized  node  interactions.  Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  messages  to 
their neighbors. These messages should be authenticated and impossible to spoof. Proposals for 
authenticated  broadcast  intended  for  use  in  a  more  conventional  setting  either  use  digital 
signatures  and/or  have  packet  overhead  that  well  exceed  the  length  of  typical  sensor  network 
packet.  TESLA  [12]  is  a  protocol  for  efficient,  authenticated  broadcast  and  flooding  that  uses 
only  symmetric  key  cryptography  and  requires  minimal  packet  overhead.  SPIN  [13]  and 
gossiping  algorithms  [14],  [15]  are  techniques  to  reduce  the  messaging  costs  and  collisions 
which still achieve robust probabilistic dissemination of messages to every node in the network. 

4.8. OSI Layer wise threats and countermeasures 

In  this  section,  we  discuss  some  of  the  known  threats  and  countermeasures  classifying  in 
different OSI layers.

ABSTRACT 

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming  decades has 
posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, 
and  potentially  thousands  of  tiny  sensor  nodes,  functioning  autonomously,  and  in  many  cases,  without 
access  to  renewable  energy  resources.  Cost  constraints  and  the  need  for  ubiquitous,  invisible 
deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in 
sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. We propose 
some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. Further, security being vital to the acceptance and 
use  of  sensor  networks  for  many  applications;  we  have  made  an  in  depth  threat  analysis  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network.  We  also  propose  some  countermeasures  against  these  threats  in  Wireless  Sensor 
Network.

1. INTRODUCTION 

We use the term sensor network to refer to a heterogeneous system combining tiny sensors and 
actuators  with  general  purpose  computing  elements.  The  Application  domains  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network  are  diverse  due  to  the  availability  of  micro-sensors  and  low-power  wireless 
communications. Unlike the traditional sensors, in the remote sensor network, a vast numbers of 
sensors  are  densely  deployed.  These  sensor  nodes  will  perform  significant  signal  processing, 
computation,  and  network  self-configuration  to  achieve  scalable,  robust  and  long-lived 
networks[5].  More  specifically,  sensor  nodes  will  do 
reduce 
communications,  and  consequently,  energy  costs.  We  believe  that  most  efficient  and  adaptive 
routing model for WSN is cluster based hierarchical model. For a cluster based sensor network, 
the cluster formation plays a key factor to the cost reduction, where cost refers to the expense of 
setup and maintenance of the sensor networks.

In  this  paper,  we  will  take  a  more  in-depth  look  at  security  in  WSN  and  discuss  counter 
measures. 

2. WSN ARCHITECTURE 

In a typical WSN we see following network components –  

•  Sensor  motes  (Field  devices)  –  Field  devices  are  mounted  in  the  process  and  must  be 
capable of routing packets on behalf of other devices. In most cases they characterize or 
control the process or process equipment. A router is a special type of field device that 
does not have process sensor or control equipment and as such does not interface with 
the process itself.

•  Gateway  or  Access  points  –  A  Gateway  enables  communication  between  Host 

application and field devices. 

•  Network  manager  –  A  Network  Manager  is  responsible  for  configuration  of  the 
network,  scheduling  communication  between  devices  (i.e.,  configuring  super  frames), 
management  of  the  routing  tables  and  monitoring  and  reporting  the  health  of  the 
network. 

•  Security manager – The Security Manager is responsible for the generation, storage, and 

management of keys.

3. WSN SECURITY ANALYSIS 

Simplicity in Wireless Sensor Network with resource constrained nodes makes them extremely 
vulnerable to variety of attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits 
in the channel, replay previously heard packets  and  many more. Securing  the  Wireless Sensor 
Network  needs  to  make  the  network  support  all  security  properties:  confidentiality,  integrity, 
authenticity and availability. Attackers may deploy a few malicious nodes with similar hardware 
capabilities  as  the  legitimate  nodes  that  might  collude  to  attack  the  system  cooperatively.  The 
attacker may come upon these malicious nodes by purchasing them separately, or by "turning" a 
few  legitimate  nodes  by  capturing  them  and  physically  overwriting  their  memory.    Also,  in 
some  cases  colluding  nodes  might  have  high-quality  communications  links  available  for 
coordinating  their  attack.  Sensor  nodes  may  not  be  tamper  resistant  and  if  an  adversary 
compromises a node, she can extract all key material, data, and code stored on that node. While 
tamper resistance might be a viable defense for physical node compromise for some networks, 
we  do  not  see  it  as  a  general  purpose  solution.  Extremely  effective  tamper  resistance  tends  to 
add  significant  per-unit  cost,  and  sensor  nodes  are  intended  to  be  very  inexpensive  [1]  [2]  [3] 
[4]. 

We identify and categorize attacks in Wireless Sensor Network as follows: 

3.1. Denial of Service 

Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  is  any  event  that  diminishes  or  eliminates  a  network's  capacity  to 
perform its expected function [16]. 

 

2 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Attack 3.1 DoS/Physical Layer/Jamming. Jamming. To jam a node or set of nodes, in this case, 
this is simply the transmission of a radio signal that interferes with the radio frequencies being 
used by the sensor network. Jamming the channel with an interrupting signal. 

Attack  3.2  DoS/Physical  Layer/Tampering.  Physical  Tampering.  Nodes  are  vulnerable  to 
physical harm, or tampering (i.e. reverse engineering). 

Attack 3.3 DoS/Data Link Layer/Collision. 

Attack 3.4 DoS/Data Link Layer/Exhaustion. 

Attack 3.5 DoS/Data Link Layer/Unfairness. 

Attack 3.6 DoS/Network Layer/Neglect and Greed. 

Attack 3.7 DoS/Network Layer/Homing. 

Attack 3.8 DoS/Network Layer/Spoofing. Misdirection. In this type of attack adversaries may 
be able to create routing loops, attract or repel network traffic, extend or shorten source routes, 
generate false error messages, partition the network, increase end-to-end latency, etc. 

Attack 3.9 DoS/Network Layer/Black Holes. 

Attack 3.10 DoS/Network Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.11 DoS/Transport Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.12 DoS/Transport Layer/De-synchronization. 

3.2. Interrogation 

Attack 3.13 Interrogation/Data Link Layer. 

3.3. Sybil 

Sybil attack is defined as a "malicious device illegitimately taking on multiple identities". Using 
the  Sybil  attack  [7],  an  adversary  can  "be  in  more  than  one  place  at  once"  as  a  single  node 
presents  multiple  identities  to  other  nodes  in  the  network  which  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  fault  tolerant  schemes  such  as  distributed  storage  [8],  dispersity  [9]  and 
multipath. It may be extremely difficult for an adversary to launch such an attack in a network 
where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or 
spread  spectrum  communication.  Sybil  attacks  also  pose  a  significant  threat  to  geographic 
routing protocols. 

Attack 3.14 Sybil/Physical Layer. 

Attack 3.15 Sybil/Data Link Layer/Data Aggregation. 

Attack  3.16  Sybil/Data  Link  Layer/Voting.  Stuffing  the  ballot  box  of  a  voting  scheme,  for 
example. 

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link 

 

4 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

acknowledgments  for  "overheard"  packets  addressed  to  neighboring  nodes.  Goals  include 
convincing the sender that a weak link is strong or that a dead or disabled node is alive. 

Attack 3.23 Acknowledgement spoofing. 

3.10. Cloning 

Attack 3.24 Cloning/Application Layer. 

3.11. Impersonation 

Attack 3.25 Node Replication. Also called Multiple Identity, Impersonation. An attacker seeks 
to add a node to an existing sensor network by copying (replicating) the node ID of an existing 
sensor node. Node replication attacks can occur if an adversary can copy the node identification 
of a network node. In this manner packets could be corrupted, misrouted or deleted, and if this 
adversary  could  perform  this  replication  it  is  possible  that  cryptographic  keys  could  be 
disclosed. 

3.12. Eavesdropping 

Attack  3.26  Monitor  and  eavesdropping.  Also  called  confidentiality.  By  listening  to  the  data, 
the  adversary  could  easily  discover  the  communication  contents.  Network  traffic  is  also 
susceptible  to  monitoring  and  eavesdropping.  This  should  be  no  cause  for  concern  given  a 
robust  security  protocol,  but  monitoring  could  lead  to  attacks  similar  to  those  previously 
described. It could also lead to wormhole or black hole attacks. 

3.13. Traffic Analysis 

Attack  3.27  Traffic  Analyses.  Traffic  analysis  attacks  are  forged  where  the  base  station  is 
determinable by observation that the majority of packets are being routed to one particular node. 
If an adversary can compromise the base station then it can render the network useless. 

3.14. Mote Class 

Also called Insider Attacks. The attackers have an authorized participant in the sensor network. 
Insider attacks may be mounted from either compromised sensor nodes running malicious code 
or adversaries who have stolen the key material, code, and data from legitimate nodes, and who 
then  use  one  or  more  laptop-class  devices  to  attack  the  network.  Mote-class  attacker  [6]  has 
access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own, but not much more than this. 
Using  ordinary  sensors  attacker  might  only  be  able  to  jam  the  radio  link  in  its  immediate 
vicinity. 

Attack  3.28  Mote-class/Control  of  Sensor  Node.  Malicious  programs,  access  cryptographic 
keys. 

3.15. Invasive 

Attack  3.29  Invasive.  Reverse  engineering,  probing.  Extract  keys,  new  code,  software 
vulnerabilities. 

3.16. Non-Invasive 

Attack  3.30  Non-Invasive.  Mote  not  physically  tampered.  Side-channel  attacks  –  Differential 
power analysis. 

3.17. Laptop Class 

 

5 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Also called Outsider Attacks. The attacker has no special access to the sensor network. Laptop 
class attacker may have access to more powerful devices, like laptops or their equivalent which 
supersede the legitimate nodes when deployed for action: they may have greater battery power, 
a  more  capable  CPU,  a  high-power  radio  transmitter,  or  a  sensitive  antenna.  Laptop-class 
attacker might be able to jam the entire sensor network using its stronger transmitter. A single 
laptop-class  attacker  might  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  an  entire  network.  Also,  laptop-class 
attackers  might  have  a  high  bandwidth,  low-latency  communications  channel  not  available  to 
ordinary sensor nodes, allowing such attackers to coordinate their efforts. 

Attack 3.31 Laptop-class/Passive Eavesdropping. 

Attack 3.32 Laptop-class/Traffic Injection. 

3.18. Attack on Protocols 

Attack 3.33 Key Management. 

Attack 3.34 Reputation Assignment Scheme. 

Attack 3.35 Data Aggregation. 

Attack 3.36 Time Synchronization. 

Attack 3.37 Intrusion Detection Systems. 

4. COUNTER MEASURES 

In this section, we discuss some of the counter measures. 

4.1. Outsider attacks and link layer security 

The majority  of outsider  attacks  against sensor network routing protocols can be prevented by 
simple  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  using  a  globally  shared  key.  Major  classes  of 
attacks  not  countered  by  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  mechanisms  are  wormhole 
attacks and HELLO flood attacks because, although an adversary is prevented from joining the 
network, nothing prevents her from using a wormhole to tunnel packets sent by legitimate nodes 
in  one  part  of  the  network  to  legitimate  nodes  in  another  part  to  convince  them  they  are 
neighbors or by amplifying an overheard broadcast packet with sufficient power to be received 
by every node in the network. 

Link  layer  security  mechanisms  using  a  globally  shared  key  are  completely  ineffective  in 
presence of insider attacks or compromised nodes. Insiders can attack the network by spoofing 
or injecting bogus routing information, creating sinkholes, selectively forwarding packets, using 
the Sybil attack, and broadcasting HELLO floods. More sophisticated defense mechanisms are 
needed  to  provide  reasonable  protection  against  wormholes  and  insider  attacks.  We  focus  on 
countermeasures against these attacks in the remaining sections. 

4.2. The Sybil attacks 

An insider cannot be prevented from participating in the network, but she should only be able to 
do so using the identities of the nodes she has compromised. Using a globally shared key allows 
an insider to masquerade as any (possibly even nonexistent) node. Identities must be verified. In 
the  traditional  setting,  this  might  be  done  using  public  key  cryptography,  but  generating  and 
verifying digital signatures is beyond the capabilities  of  sensor nodes.  One  solution is to have 
every node share a unique symmetric key with a trusted base station. Two nodes can then use a 

 

6 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Needham-Schroeder  like  protocol to  verify  each  other's  identity  and  establish  a  shared  key.  A 
pair  of  neighboring  nodes  can  use  the  resulting  key  to  implement  an  authenticated,  encrypted 
link between them. In order to prevent an insider from wandering around a stationary network 
and  establishing  shared  keys  with  every  node  in  the  network,  the  base  station  can  reasonably 
limit the number of neighbors a node is allowed to have and send an error message when a node 
exceeds it. Thus, when a node is compromised, it is restricted to (meaningfully) communicating 
only  with  its  verified  neighbors.  This  is  not  to  say  that  nodes  are  forbidden  from  sending 
messages to base stations or aggregation points multiple hops away, but they are restricted from 
using any node except their verified neighbors to do so. In addition, an adversary can still use a 
wormhole  to  create  an  artificial  link between  two  nodes  to  convince  them  they  are  neighbors, 
but  the  adversary  will  not  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  or  modify  any  future  communications 
between them. 

4.3. HELLO flood attacks 

The  simplest  defense  against  HELLO  flood  attacks  is  to  verify  the  bi  directionality  of  a  link 
before  taking  meaningful  action  based  on  a  message  received  over  that  link.  The  identity 
verification protocol is  sufficient to  prevent HELLO  flood attacks. Not only  does  it  verify  the 
bidirectional link between two nodes, but even if a well-funded adversary had a highly sensitive 
receiver  or  had  wormholes  to  a  multiple  locations  in  the  network,  a  trusted  base  station  that 
limits the number of verified neighbors for each node will still prevent HELLO flood attacks on 
large segments of the network when a small number of nodes have been compromised. 

4.4. Wormhole and Sinkhole attacks 

Wormhole and sinkhole attacks are very difficult to defend against, especially when the two are 
used  in  combination.  Wormholes  are  hard  to  detect  because  they  use  a  private,  out-of-band 
channel invisible to the underlying sensor network. Sinkholes are difficult to defend against in 
protocols that use advertised information such as remaining energy or an estimate of end-to-end 
reliability to construct a routing topology because this information is hard to verify. Routes that 
minimize  the  hop-count  to  a  base  station  are  easier  to  verify,  however  hop-count  can  be 
completely  misrepresented  through  a  wormhole.  When  routes  are  established  simply  based  on 
the  reception  of  a  packet  as  in  TinyOS  beaconing  or  directed  diffusion,  sinkholes  are  easy  to 
create  because  there  is  no  information  for  a  defender  to  verify.  A  technique  for  detecting 
wormhole attacks is presented in [10], but it requires extremely tight time synchronization and 
is thus infeasible for most sensor networks. Because it is extremely difficult to retrofit existing 
protocols  with  defenses  against  these  attacks,  the  best  solution  is  to  carefully  design  routing 
protocols in which wormholes and sinkholes are meaningless. 

4.5. Leveraging Global Knowledge 

A  significant  challenge  in  securing  large  sensor  networks  is  their  inherent  self  organizing, 
decentralized  nature.  When  the  network  size  is  limited  or  the  topology  is  well  structured  or 
controlled,  global  knowledge  can  be  leveraged  in  security  mechanisms.  Consider  a  relatively 
small network of around 100 nodes or less. If it can be assumed that no nodes are compromised 
during deployment, then after the initial topology is formed, each node could send information 
such as neighboring nodes and its geographic location (if known) back to a base station. Using 
this information, the base station(s) can map the topology of the entire network. To account for 
topology  changes  due  to  radio interference  or  node  failure,  nodes  would periodically  update  a 
base  station  with  the  appropriate  information.  Drastic  or  suspicious  changes  to  the  topology 
might indicate a node compromise, and the appropriate action can be taken. We have discussed 
why geographic routing can be relatively secure against wormhole, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, 
but the main remaining problem is that location information advertised from neighboring nodes 
must  be  trusted.  A  compromised  node  advertising  its  location  on  a  line  between  the  targeted 

 

7 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

node and a base station will guarantee it is  the destination for all forwarded packets from that 
node.  Probabilistic  selection  of  a  next  hop  from  several  acceptable  destinations  or  multipath 
routing to multiple base stations can help with this problem, but it is not perfect. When a node 
must route around a "hole", an adversary can "help" by appearing to be the only reasonable node 
to  forward  packets  to.  Sufficiently  restricting  the  structure  of  the  topology  can  eliminate  the 
requirement for nodes to advertise their locations if all nodes' locations are well known. 

4.6. Selective forwarding 

Even  in  protocols  completely  resistant  to  sinkholes,  wormholes,  and  the  Sybil  attack,  a 
compromised  node  has  a  significant  probability  of  including  itself  on  a  data  flow  to  launch  a 
selective  forwarding  attack  if  it  is  strategically  located  near  the  source  or  a  base  station. 
Multipath routing can be used to counter these types of selective forwarding attacks. Messages 
routed  over  paths  whose  nodes  are  completely  disjoint  are  completely  protected  against 
selective  forwarding  attacks  involving  at  most  compromised  nodes  and  still  offer  some 
probabilistic protection whenever nodes are compromised. However, completely disjoint paths 
may be difficult to create. Braided paths [11] may have nodes in common, but have no links in 
common  (i.e.,  no  two  consecutive  nodes  in  common).  The  use  of  multiple  braided  paths  may 
provide probabilistic protection against selective forwarding and use only localized information. 
Allowing  nodes  to  dynamically  choose  a  packet's  next  hop  probabilistically  from  a  set  of 
possible candidates can further reduce the chances of an adversary gaining complete control of a 
data flow. 

4.7. Authenticated broadcast and flooding 

If we have base stations trustworthy, adversaries must not be able to spoof broadcast or flooded 
messages from any base station. This requires some level of asymmetry: since every node in the 
network can potentially be compromised, no node should be able to spoof messages from a base 
station, yet every node should be able to verify them. Authenticated broadcast is also useful for 
localized  node  interactions.  Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  messages  to 
their neighbors. These messages should be authenticated and impossible to spoof. Proposals for 
authenticated  broadcast  intended  for  use  in  a  more  conventional  setting  either  use  digital 
signatures  and/or  have  packet  overhead  that  well  exceed  the  length  of  typical  sensor  network 
packet.  TESLA  [12]  is  a  protocol  for  efficient,  authenticated  broadcast  and  flooding  that  uses 
only  symmetric  key  cryptography  and  requires  minimal  packet  overhead.  SPIN  [13]  and 
gossiping  algorithms  [14],  [15]  are  techniques  to  reduce  the  messaging  costs  and  collisions 
which still achieve robust probabilistic dissemination of messages to every node in the network. 

4.8. OSI Layer wise threats and countermeasures 

In  this  section,  we  discuss  some  of  the  known  threats  and  countermeasures  classifying  in 
different OSI layers.

Security in Wireless Sensor Network is  vital to the acceptance  and use of sensor networks. In 
particular, Wireless Sensor Network product in industry will not get acceptance unless there is a 
fool proof security to the network. In this paper, we have made a threat analysis to the Wireless 
Sensor  Network  and  suggested  some  counter  measures.  Link 
layer  encryption  and 
authentication  mechanisms  may  be  a  reasonable  first  approximation  for  defense  against  mote 
class  outsiders,  but  cryptography  is  not  enough  to  defend  against  laptop-class  adversaries  and 
insiders: careful protocol design is needed as well.

ABSTRACT 

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming  decades has 
posed numerous unique challenges to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of hundreds, 
and  potentially  thousands  of  tiny  sensor  nodes,  functioning  autonomously,  and  in  many  cases,  without 
access  to  renewable  energy  resources.  Cost  constraints  and  the  need  for  ubiquitous,  invisible 
deployments will result in small sized, resource-constrained sensor nodes. While the set of challenges in 
sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. We propose 
some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. Further, security being vital to the acceptance and 
use  of  sensor  networks  for  many  applications;  we  have  made  an  in  depth  threat  analysis  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network.  We  also  propose  some  countermeasures  against  these  threats  in  Wireless  Sensor 
Network.

1. INTRODUCTION 

We use the term sensor network to refer to a heterogeneous system combining tiny sensors and 
actuators  with  general  purpose  computing  elements.  The  Application  domains  of  Wireless 
Sensor  Network  are  diverse  due  to  the  availability  of  micro-sensors  and  low-power  wireless 
communications. Unlike the traditional sensors, in the remote sensor network, a vast numbers of 
sensors  are  densely  deployed.  These  sensor  nodes  will  perform  significant  signal  processing, 
computation,  and  network  self-configuration  to  achieve  scalable,  robust  and  long-lived 
networks[5].  More  specifically,  sensor  nodes  will  do 
reduce 
communications,  and  consequently,  energy  costs.  We  believe  that  most  efficient  and  adaptive 
routing model for WSN is cluster based hierarchical model. For a cluster based sensor network, 
the cluster formation plays a key factor to the cost reduction, where cost refers to the expense of 
setup and maintenance of the sensor networks.

In  this  paper,  we  will  take  a  more  in-depth  look  at  security  in  WSN  and  discuss  counter 
measures. 

2. WSN ARCHITECTURE 

In a typical WSN we see following network components –  

•  Sensor  motes  (Field  devices)  –  Field  devices  are  mounted  in  the  process  and  must  be 
capable of routing packets on behalf of other devices. In most cases they characterize or 
control the process or process equipment. A router is a special type of field device that 
does not have process sensor or control equipment and as such does not interface with 
the process itself.

•  Gateway  or  Access  points  –  A  Gateway  enables  communication  between  Host 

application and field devices. 

•  Network  manager  –  A  Network  Manager  is  responsible  for  configuration  of  the 
network,  scheduling  communication  between  devices  (i.e.,  configuring  super  frames), 
management  of  the  routing  tables  and  monitoring  and  reporting  the  health  of  the 
network. 

•  Security manager – The Security Manager is responsible for the generation, storage, and 

management of keys.

3. WSN SECURITY ANALYSIS 

Simplicity in Wireless Sensor Network with resource constrained nodes makes them extremely 
vulnerable to variety of attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits 
in the channel, replay previously heard packets  and  many more. Securing  the  Wireless Sensor 
Network  needs  to  make  the  network  support  all  security  properties:  confidentiality,  integrity, 
authenticity and availability. Attackers may deploy a few malicious nodes with similar hardware 
capabilities  as  the  legitimate  nodes  that  might  collude  to  attack  the  system  cooperatively.  The 
attacker may come upon these malicious nodes by purchasing them separately, or by "turning" a 
few  legitimate  nodes  by  capturing  them  and  physically  overwriting  their  memory.    Also,  in 
some  cases  colluding  nodes  might  have  high-quality  communications  links  available  for 
coordinating  their  attack.  Sensor  nodes  may  not  be  tamper  resistant  and  if  an  adversary 
compromises a node, she can extract all key material, data, and code stored on that node. While 
tamper resistance might be a viable defense for physical node compromise for some networks, 
we  do  not  see  it  as  a  general  purpose  solution.  Extremely  effective  tamper  resistance  tends  to 
add  significant  per-unit  cost,  and  sensor  nodes  are  intended  to  be  very  inexpensive  [1]  [2]  [3] 
[4]. 

We identify and categorize attacks in Wireless Sensor Network as follows: 

3.1. Denial of Service 

Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  is  any  event  that  diminishes  or  eliminates  a  network's  capacity  to 
perform its expected function [16]. 

 

2 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Attack 3.1 DoS/Physical Layer/Jamming. Jamming. To jam a node or set of nodes, in this case, 
this is simply the transmission of a radio signal that interferes with the radio frequencies being 
used by the sensor network. Jamming the channel with an interrupting signal. 

Attack  3.2  DoS/Physical  Layer/Tampering.  Physical  Tampering.  Nodes  are  vulnerable  to 
physical harm, or tampering (i.e. reverse engineering). 

Attack 3.3 DoS/Data Link Layer/Collision. 

Attack 3.4 DoS/Data Link Layer/Exhaustion. 

Attack 3.5 DoS/Data Link Layer/Unfairness. 

Attack 3.6 DoS/Network Layer/Neglect and Greed. 

Attack 3.7 DoS/Network Layer/Homing. 

Attack 3.8 DoS/Network Layer/Spoofing. Misdirection. In this type of attack adversaries may 
be able to create routing loops, attract or repel network traffic, extend or shorten source routes, 
generate false error messages, partition the network, increase end-to-end latency, etc. 

Attack 3.9 DoS/Network Layer/Black Holes. 

Attack 3.10 DoS/Network Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.11 DoS/Transport Layer/Flooding. 

Attack 3.12 DoS/Transport Layer/De-synchronization. 

3.2. Interrogation 

Attack 3.13 Interrogation/Data Link Layer. 

3.3. Sybil 

Sybil attack is defined as a "malicious device illegitimately taking on multiple identities". Using 
the  Sybil  attack  [7],  an  adversary  can  "be  in  more  than  one  place  at  once"  as  a  single  node 
presents  multiple  identities  to  other  nodes  in  the  network  which  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  fault  tolerant  schemes  such  as  distributed  storage  [8],  dispersity  [9]  and 
multipath. It may be extremely difficult for an adversary to launch such an attack in a network 
where  every  pair  of  neighboring  nodes  uses  a  unique  key  to  initialize  frequency  hopping  or 
spread  spectrum  communication.  Sybil  attacks  also  pose  a  significant  threat  to  geographic 
routing protocols. 

Attack 3.14 Sybil/Physical Layer. 

Attack 3.15 Sybil/Data Link Layer/Data Aggregation. 

Attack  3.16  Sybil/Data  Link  Layer/Voting.  Stuffing  the  ballot  box  of  a  voting  scheme,  for 
example. 

Attack 3.17 Sybil/Network Layer. 

3.4. Wormhole 

 

3 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

In the wormhole attack [10], an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network 
over  a  low  latency  link  and  replays  them  in  a  different  part.  An  adversary  situated  close  to  a 
base station may be able to completely disrupt routing by creating a well-placed wormhole. An 
adversary could convince nodes who would normally be multiple hops from a base station that 
they  are  only  one  or  two  hops  away  via  the  wormhole.  This  can  create  a  sinkhole:  since  the 
adversary on the other side of the wormhole can artificially provide a high-quality route to the 
base station, potentially all traffic in the surrounding area will be drawn through her if alternate 
routes are significantly less attractive. 

Attack  3.18  Wormhole/Network  Layer.  A  routing  attack  where  an  adversary  convinces  a 
network  node  of  a  shorter,  or  zero,  path  to  the  base  station,  for  example,  and  can  disrupt  the 
network in this manner. 

3.5. Sinkhole (Black hole) 

Sinkhole  attacks  typically  work  by  making  a  compromised  node  look  especially  attractive  to 
surrounding  nodes  with  respect  to  the  routing  algorithm  and  lure  nearly  all  the  traffic  from  a 
particular  area  through  a  compromised  node,  creating  a  metaphorical  sinkhole  with  the 
adversary  at  the  center.  Because  nodes  on,  or  near,  the  path  that  packets  follow  have  many 
opportunities  to  tamper  with  application  data,  sinkhole  attacks  can  enable  many  other  attacks 
(selective forwarding, for example). 

Attack 3.19 Sinkhole/Network Layer. 

3.6. Manipulating Routing Information 

Attack 3.20 Manipulating Routing Information/Network Layer. 

3.7. Selective Forwarding 

In  a  selective  forwarding  attack,  malicious  nodes  behaves  like  black  hole  and  may  refuse  to 
forward  certain  messages  and  simply  drop  them,  ensuring  that  they  are  not  propagated  any 
further. However, such an attacker runs the risks that neighboring nodes will conclude that she 
has  failed  and  decide  to  seek  another  route.  A  more  subtle  form  of  this  attack  is  when  an 
adversary  selectively  forwards  packets.  An  adversary  interested  in  suppressing  or  modifying 
packets originating from a select few nodes can reliably forward the remaining traffic and limit 
suspicion of her wrongdoing. 

Attack 3.21 Selective Forwarding/Network Layer. 

3.8. Hello Flood 

Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  packets  to  announce  themselves  to  their 
neighbors, and a node receiving such a packet may assume that it is within (normal) radio range 
of  the  sender.  This  assumption  may  be  false:  a  laptop-class  attacker  broadcasting  routing  or 
other  information  with  large  enough  transmission  power  could  convince  every  node  in  the 
network that the adversary is its neighbor and begin exchanging information with the nodes. 

Attack 3.22 Hello Flood/Network Layer. 

3.9. Acknowledgement Spoofing 

Several  sensor  network  routing  algorithms  rely  on 
layer 
acknowledgements.  Due  to  the  inherent  broadcast  medium,  an  adversary  can  spoof  link  layer 

implicit  or  explicit 

link

acknowledgments  for  "overheard"  packets  addressed  to  neighboring  nodes.  Goals  include 
convincing the sender that a weak link is strong or that a dead or disabled node is alive. 

Attack 3.23 Acknowledgement spoofing. 

3.10. Cloning 

Attack 3.24 Cloning/Application Layer. 

3.11. Impersonation 

Attack 3.25 Node Replication. Also called Multiple Identity, Impersonation. An attacker seeks 
to add a node to an existing sensor network by copying (replicating) the node ID of an existing 
sensor node. Node replication attacks can occur if an adversary can copy the node identification 
of a network node. In this manner packets could be corrupted, misrouted or deleted, and if this 
adversary  could  perform  this  replication  it  is  possible  that  cryptographic  keys  could  be 
disclosed. 

3.12. Eavesdropping 

Attack  3.26  Monitor  and  eavesdropping.  Also  called  confidentiality.  By  listening  to  the  data, 
the  adversary  could  easily  discover  the  communication  contents.  Network  traffic  is  also 
susceptible  to  monitoring  and  eavesdropping.  This  should  be  no  cause  for  concern  given  a 
robust  security  protocol,  but  monitoring  could  lead  to  attacks  similar  to  those  previously 
described. It could also lead to wormhole or black hole attacks. 

3.13. Traffic Analysis 

Attack  3.27  Traffic  Analyses.  Traffic  analysis  attacks  are  forged  where  the  base  station  is 
determinable by observation that the majority of packets are being routed to one particular node. 
If an adversary can compromise the base station then it can render the network useless. 

3.14. Mote Class 

Also called Insider Attacks. The attackers have an authorized participant in the sensor network. 
Insider attacks may be mounted from either compromised sensor nodes running malicious code 
or adversaries who have stolen the key material, code, and data from legitimate nodes, and who 
then  use  one  or  more  laptop-class  devices  to  attack  the  network.  Mote-class  attacker  [6]  has 
access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own, but not much more than this. 
Using  ordinary  sensors  attacker  might  only  be  able  to  jam  the  radio  link  in  its  immediate 
vicinity. 

Attack  3.28  Mote-class/Control  of  Sensor  Node.  Malicious  programs,  access  cryptographic 
keys. 

3.15. Invasive 

Attack  3.29  Invasive.  Reverse  engineering,  probing.  Extract  keys,  new  code,  software 
vulnerabilities. 

3.16. Non-Invasive 

Attack  3.30  Non-Invasive.  Mote  not  physically  tampered.  Side-channel  attacks  –  Differential 
power analysis. 

3.17. Laptop Class 

 

5 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Also called Outsider Attacks. The attacker has no special access to the sensor network. Laptop 
class attacker may have access to more powerful devices, like laptops or their equivalent which 
supersede the legitimate nodes when deployed for action: they may have greater battery power, 
a  more  capable  CPU,  a  high-power  radio  transmitter,  or  a  sensitive  antenna.  Laptop-class 
attacker might be able to jam the entire sensor network using its stronger transmitter. A single 
laptop-class  attacker  might  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  an  entire  network.  Also,  laptop-class 
attackers  might  have  a  high  bandwidth,  low-latency  communications  channel  not  available  to 
ordinary sensor nodes, allowing such attackers to coordinate their efforts.

4. COUNTER MEASURES 

In this section, we discuss some of the counter measures. 

4.1. Outsider attacks and link layer security 

The majority  of outsider  attacks  against sensor network routing protocols can be prevented by 
simple  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  using  a  globally  shared  key.  Major  classes  of 
attacks  not  countered  by  link  layer  encryption  and  authentication  mechanisms  are  wormhole 
attacks and HELLO flood attacks because, although an adversary is prevented from joining the 
network, nothing prevents her from using a wormhole to tunnel packets sent by legitimate nodes 
in  one  part  of  the  network  to  legitimate  nodes  in  another  part  to  convince  them  they  are 
neighbors or by amplifying an overheard broadcast packet with sufficient power to be received 
by every node in the network. 

Link  layer  security  mechanisms  using  a  globally  shared  key  are  completely  ineffective  in 
presence of insider attacks or compromised nodes. Insiders can attack the network by spoofing 
or injecting bogus routing information, creating sinkholes, selectively forwarding packets, using 
the Sybil attack, and broadcasting HELLO floods. More sophisticated defense mechanisms are 
needed  to  provide  reasonable  protection  against  wormholes  and  insider  attacks.  We  focus  on 
countermeasures against these attacks in the remaining sections. 

4.2. The Sybil attacks 

An insider cannot be prevented from participating in the network, but she should only be able to 
do so using the identities of the nodes she has compromised. Using a globally shared key allows 
an insider to masquerade as any (possibly even nonexistent) node. Identities must be verified. In 
the  traditional  setting,  this  might  be  done  using  public  key  cryptography,  but  generating  and 
verifying digital signatures is beyond the capabilities  of  sensor nodes.  One  solution is to have 
every node share a unique symmetric key with a trusted base station. Two nodes can then use a 

 

6 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

Needham-Schroeder  like  protocol to  verify  each  other's  identity  and  establish  a  shared  key.  A 
pair  of  neighboring  nodes  can  use  the  resulting  key  to  implement  an  authenticated,  encrypted 
link between them. In order to prevent an insider from wandering around a stationary network 
and  establishing  shared  keys  with  every  node  in  the  network,  the  base  station  can  reasonably 
limit the number of neighbors a node is allowed to have and send an error message when a node 
exceeds it. Thus, when a node is compromised, it is restricted to (meaningfully) communicating 
only  with  its  verified  neighbors.  This  is  not  to  say  that  nodes  are  forbidden  from  sending 
messages to base stations or aggregation points multiple hops away, but they are restricted from 
using any node except their verified neighbors to do so. In addition, an adversary can still use a 
wormhole  to  create  an  artificial  link between  two  nodes  to  convince  them  they  are  neighbors, 
but  the  adversary  will  not  be  able  to  eavesdrop  on  or  modify  any  future  communications 
between them. 

4.3. HELLO flood attacks 

The  simplest  defense  against  HELLO  flood  attacks  is  to  verify  the  bi  directionality  of  a  link 
before  taking  meaningful  action  based  on  a  message  received  over  that  link.  The  identity 
verification protocol is  sufficient to  prevent HELLO  flood attacks. Not only  does  it  verify  the 
bidirectional link between two nodes, but even if a well-funded adversary had a highly sensitive 
receiver  or  had  wormholes  to  a  multiple  locations  in  the  network,  a  trusted  base  station  that 
limits the number of verified neighbors for each node will still prevent HELLO flood attacks on 
large segments of the network when a small number of nodes have been compromised. 

4.4. Wormhole and Sinkhole attacks 

Wormhole and sinkhole attacks are very difficult to defend against, especially when the two are 
used  in  combination.  Wormholes  are  hard  to  detect  because  they  use  a  private,  out-of-band 
channel invisible to the underlying sensor network. Sinkholes are difficult to defend against in 
protocols that use advertised information such as remaining energy or an estimate of end-to-end 
reliability to construct a routing topology because this information is hard to verify. Routes that 
minimize  the  hop-count  to  a  base  station  are  easier  to  verify,  however  hop-count  can  be 
completely  misrepresented  through  a  wormhole.  When  routes  are  established  simply  based  on 
the  reception  of  a  packet  as  in  TinyOS  beaconing  or  directed  diffusion,  sinkholes  are  easy  to 
create  because  there  is  no  information  for  a  defender  to  verify.  A  technique  for  detecting 
wormhole attacks is presented in [10], but it requires extremely tight time synchronization and 
is thus infeasible for most sensor networks. Because it is extremely difficult to retrofit existing 
protocols  with  defenses  against  these  attacks,  the  best  solution  is  to  carefully  design  routing 
protocols in which wormholes and sinkholes are meaningless. 

4.5. Leveraging Global Knowledge 

A  significant  challenge  in  securing  large  sensor  networks  is  their  inherent  self  organizing, 
decentralized  nature.  When  the  network  size  is  limited  or  the  topology  is  well  structured  or 
controlled,  global  knowledge  can  be  leveraged  in  security  mechanisms.  Consider  a  relatively 
small network of around 100 nodes or less. If it can be assumed that no nodes are compromised 
during deployment, then after the initial topology is formed, each node could send information 
such as neighboring nodes and its geographic location (if known) back to a base station. Using 
this information, the base station(s) can map the topology of the entire network. To account for 
topology  changes  due  to  radio interference  or  node  failure,  nodes  would periodically  update  a 
base  station  with  the  appropriate  information.  Drastic  or  suspicious  changes  to  the  topology 
might indicate a node compromise, and the appropriate action can be taken. We have discussed 
why geographic routing can be relatively secure against wormhole, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, 
but the main remaining problem is that location information advertised from neighboring nodes 
must  be  trusted.  A  compromised  node  advertising  its  location  on  a  line  between  the  targeted 

 

7 

International Journal of Next-Generation Networks (IJNGN),Vol.1, No.1, December 2009 

node and a base station will guarantee it is  the destination for all forwarded packets from that 
node.  Probabilistic  selection  of  a  next  hop  from  several  acceptable  destinations  or  multipath 
routing to multiple base stations can help with this problem, but it is not perfect. When a node 
must route around a "hole", an adversary can "help" by appearing to be the only reasonable node 
to  forward  packets  to.  Sufficiently  restricting  the  structure  of  the  topology  can  eliminate  the 
requirement for nodes to advertise their locations if all nodes' locations are well known. 

4.6. Selective forwarding 

Even  in  protocols  completely  resistant  to  sinkholes,  wormholes,  and  the  Sybil  attack,  a 
compromised  node  has  a  significant  probability  of  including  itself  on  a  data  flow  to  launch  a 
selective  forwarding  attack  if  it  is  strategically  located  near  the  source  or  a  base  station. 
Multipath routing can be used to counter these types of selective forwarding attacks. Messages 
routed  over  paths  whose  nodes  are  completely  disjoint  are  completely  protected  against 
selective  forwarding  attacks  involving  at  most  compromised  nodes  and  still  offer  some 
probabilistic protection whenever nodes are compromised. However, completely disjoint paths 
may be difficult to create. Braided paths [11] may have nodes in common, but have no links in 
common  (i.e.,  no  two  consecutive  nodes  in  common).  The  use  of  multiple  braided  paths  may 
provide probabilistic protection against selective forwarding and use only localized information. 
Allowing  nodes  to  dynamically  choose  a  packet's  next  hop  probabilistically  from  a  set  of 
possible candidates can further reduce the chances of an adversary gaining complete control of a 
data flow. 

4.7. Authenticated broadcast and flooding 

If we have base stations trustworthy, adversaries must not be able to spoof broadcast or flooded 
messages from any base station. This requires some level of asymmetry: since every node in the 
network can potentially be compromised, no node should be able to spoof messages from a base 
station, yet every node should be able to verify them. Authenticated broadcast is also useful for 
localized  node  interactions.  Many  protocols  require  nodes  to  broadcast  HELLO  messages  to 
their neighbors. These messages should be authenticated and impossible to spoof. Proposals for 
authenticated  broadcast  intended  for  use  in  a  more  conventional  setting  either  use  digital 
signatures  and/or  have  packet  overhead  that  well  exceed  the  length  of  typical  sensor  network 
packet.  TESLA  [12]  is  a  protocol  for  efficient,  authenticated  broadcast  and  flooding  that  uses 
only  symmetric  key  cryptography  and  requires  minimal  packet  overhead.  SPIN  [13]  and 
gossiping  algorithms  [14],  [15]  are  techniques  to  reduce  the  messaging  costs  and  collisions 
which still achieve robust probabilistic dissemination of messages to every node in the network.

Security in Wireless Sensor Network is  vital to the acceptance  and use of sensor networks. In 
particular, Wireless Sensor Network product in industry will not get acceptance unless there is a 
fool proof security to the network. In this paper, we have made a threat analysis to the Wireless 
Sensor  Network  and  suggested  some  counter  measures.  Link 
layer  encryption  and 
authentication  mechanisms  may  be  a  reasonable  first  approximation  for  defense  against  mote 
class  outsiders,  but  cryptography  is  not  enough  to  defend  against  laptop-class  adversaries  and 
insiders: careful protocol design is needed as well.
