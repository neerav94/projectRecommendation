II. OVERVIEW OF RFID TECHNOLOGY

 

RFID  system  consists  of  three  components  namely 
 
transponder  (tag), 
interrogator  (reader)  and  computer 
containing the database, as shown in Fig. 1. The interrogator 
reads  the  tag  data  and  transmits  it  to  the  computer  for 
authentication.  The  information  is  processed  and  upon 
verification,  access  is  granted.  The  system  offers  diverse 
frequency band ranging from low frequencies to microwave 
frequencies [5]: 

Low Frequency: 125-134 KHz 


 High Frequency: 13.56 MHz 
 Ultra High Frequency: 902-928 MHz 
 Microwave Frequency: 2.4 GHz 

 

 

 

Depending upon the source of electrical energy, RFID tags 
are classified as either active or passive. The active tags use a 
battery for powering the circuit on the tag and transmit the tag 
information upon the reader request. However, these tags are 
very expensive and seldom used. On the other hands, passive 
tags get energy from the reader to power their circuit. These 
tags are very cost-effective and hence most of the applications 
use them. A comparison of these tags highlighting important 
features is shown in Table I [6]-[8]. 

 

In the present work, passive RFID tags have been used. A 
passive RFID tag transmits information to the reader when it 
comes in the vicinity of electromagnetic field generated by the 
reader.  The  phenomenon  is  based  on  Faraday‟s  law  of 
electromagnetic  induction.  The  current  flowing  through  the 
coil of interrogator produces a magnetic field which links to 
the  transponder  coil  thereby  producing  a  current  in  the

Many  researchers  have  utilized  RFID  technology  in 
developing access control system. Filipe [7] has developed an 
RFID based monitoring and access control system consisting 
of RFID terminal, camera, server and an alert device. Upon 
detecting  a  transponder,  the  terminal  captures  a  photo  and 
transmits the data including the UID and photo to the server 
through  TCP/IP  connection.  The  server  searchers  the 
database for this particular query and sends the results back to 
the  terminal  to  allow  or  deny  the  access.  The  system  also 
monitors illicit acts e.g., a person tries to enter when the door 
is  open  without  completion  of  authentication  process  and 
turns on the alert device using web services. The performance 
of the system is tested by installing RFID kits with antennas 
covering a range of 10cm and satisfactory results are obtained. 
Xiang-Lei Meng [9] has described an RFID based embedded 
security  authentication  system  with  novel  face  recognition 
structure.  The  system  comprises  of  two  phases  namely 
 
registration  and  recognition.  In  registration  phase,  ten 
pictures of user face with different emotions are collected and 
eigen  information  is  obtained  with  an  extraction  algorithm. 
 
This information along with a UID is written on RFID tag. In 
recognition phase, a camera tracks the face and an extraction 
algorithm returns eigen information of the face in the picture. 
This information is then matched with the information already 
stored on the tag for authentication. The entire processing is 
done  on  embedded  ARM11  processor,  S3C6410  instead  of 
computer  terminal/server  which  has  resulted  in  faster 
response time, about 57ms with authentication accuracy up to 
86.5%. The performance of the system is compared with the 
existing  database  systems  and  is  found  to  have  far  better 
response  time  with  the  same  authentication  accuracy. 
Dong-Liang Wu [10] has described an access control system 
based on RFID in conjunction with face recognition based on 
neural  network.  The  system  recognizes  the  face  of  person 
holding RFID card and denies the access if person is found to 
be  unauthorized.  Radial  basis  function  neural  network 
(RBFNN) has been used for learning the face of authorized 
persons. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used 
for  extracting  the  features  from  the  image  and  linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) for refining these features. The 
network is trained with localized generalization error model 
(L-GEM)  for  enhancing  its  generalization  capabilities.

II. OVERVIEW OF RFID TECHNOLOGY

 

RFID  system  consists  of  three  components  namely 
 
transponder  (tag), 
interrogator  (reader)  and  computer 
containing the database, as shown in Fig. 1. The interrogator 
reads  the  tag  data  and  transmits  it  to  the  computer  for 
authentication.  The  information  is  processed  and  upon 
verification,  access  is  granted.  The  system  offers  diverse 
frequency band ranging from low frequencies to microwave 
frequencies [5]: 

Low Frequency: 125-134 KHz 


 High Frequency: 13.56 MHz 
 Ultra High Frequency: 902-928 MHz 
 Microwave Frequency: 2.4 GHz 

 

 

 

Depending upon the source of electrical energy, RFID tags 
are classified as either active or passive. The active tags use a 
battery for powering the circuit on the tag and transmit the tag 
information upon the reader request. However, these tags are 
very expensive and seldom used. On the other hands, passive 
tags get energy from the reader to power their circuit. These 
tags are very cost-effective and hence most of the applications 
use them. A comparison of these tags highlighting important 
features is shown in Table I [6]-[8]. 

 

In the present work, passive RFID tags have been used. A 
passive RFID tag transmits information to the reader when it 
comes in the vicinity of electromagnetic field generated by the 
reader.  The  phenomenon  is  based  on  Faraday‟s  law  of 
electromagnetic  induction.  The  current  flowing  through  the 
coil of interrogator produces a magnetic field which links to 
the  transponder  coil  thereby  producing  a  current  in  the

Many  researchers  have  utilized  RFID  technology  in 
developing access control system. Filipe [7] has developed an 
RFID based monitoring and access control system consisting 
of RFID terminal, camera, server and an alert device. Upon 
detecting  a  transponder,  the  terminal  captures  a  photo  and 
transmits the data including the UID and photo to the server 
through  TCP/IP  connection.  The  server  searchers  the 
database for this particular query and sends the results back to 
the  terminal  to  allow  or  deny  the  access.  The  system  also 
monitors illicit acts e.g., a person tries to enter when the door 
is  open  without  completion  of  authentication  process  and 
turns on the alert device using web services. The performance 
of the system is tested by installing RFID kits with antennas 
covering a range of 10cm and satisfactory results are obtained. 
Xiang-Lei Meng [9] has described an RFID based embedded 
security  authentication  system  with  novel  face  recognition 
structure.  The  system  comprises  of  two  phases  namely 
 
registration  and  recognition.  In  registration  phase,  ten 
pictures of user face with different emotions are collected and 
eigen  information  is  obtained  with  an  extraction  algorithm. 
 
This information along with a UID is written on RFID tag. In 
recognition phase, a camera tracks the face and an extraction 
algorithm returns eigen information of the face in the picture. 
This information is then matched with the information already 
stored on the tag for authentication. The entire processing is 
done  on  embedded  ARM11  processor,  S3C6410  instead  of 
computer  terminal/server  which  has  resulted  in  faster 
response time, about 57ms with authentication accuracy up to 
86.5%. The performance of the system is compared with the 
existing  database  systems  and  is  found  to  have  far  better 
response  time  with  the  same  authentication  accuracy. 
Dong-Liang Wu [10] has described an access control system 
based on RFID in conjunction with face recognition based on 
neural  network.  The  system  recognizes  the  face  of  person 
holding RFID card and denies the access if person is found to 
be  unauthorized.  Radial  basis  function  neural  network 
(RBFNN) has been used for learning the face of authorized 
persons. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used 
for  extracting  the  features  from  the  image  and  linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) for refining these features. The 
network is trained with localized generalization error model 
(L-GEM)  for  enhancing  its  generalization  capabilities.

(VM)  for  JAVATM.  Nokia  12i  also  supports  reliable  inbuilt 
internet protocols: TCP/IP for reliable data transfer, UDP/IP 
for audio and video streaming and HTTP for accessing web 
pages. The module can also be connected to an external GPS 
device that supports National Marine Electronics Association 
(NMEA)  standard.  The  inbuilt  NMEA  parser  can  parse  the 
location  data  from  the  output  that  it  receives  from  the  GPS

The security and access control system is comprised of two 
phases:  registration  phase  and  recognition  phase.  In  the 
registration phase, ten images of the hostel user are captured 
while issuing an RFID tag. These images are used to train a 
feed forward neural network with back propagation training 
algorithm 
stored 
corresponding  to  a  particular  user.  The  recognition  phase 
comes when the user wants to enter the hostel. At this point, 
after getting RFID user number, image of the user is captured 
and passed to the neural network for recognition. If a match is 
found, access is granted to the user. The user authenticity is 
checked at three places: hostel entrance, hostel exit and mess 
entrance. The entrance and exit modules use RFID and face 
recognition  for  identification  while  mess  module  use  RFID 
with  a  password  to  grant  permission.  These  modules 
communicate with computer system through a main controller. 
The main controller transmits the modules information to the 
computer system. The computer system after processing these 
 
interrupts  issues  commands  to  the  modules  through  main 
controller.  The  data  exchange  between  the  main  controller 
and computer system is through serial port while parallel port 
data and control lines are used for handshaking purposes. The 
block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2.

microcontroller  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  After  detecting  and 
receiving  RFID  tag  data  through  a  serial  interrupt  routine, 
microcontroller searches the NV-RAM for this number. If no 
match is found, the microcontroller makes an emergency call 
to the security van through GSM modem. At the same time, it 
sends  a  request  to  the  computer  system  through  main 
controller  to  capture  the  user  image  and  turns  on  the  alarm 
signal.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  match  is  found,  the 
microcontroller  checks  the  entrance  status  of  the  user  by 
scanning NV-RAM. If the user has not entered in the hostel 
yet, the controller sends a request to the computer system to

Abstract—This  paper  describes  the  design  of  RFID  based 
security  and  access  control  system  for  use  in  hostels  inside  the 
 
Punjab  University  premises.  The  system  combines  RFID 
technology  and  biometrics  to  accomplish  the  required  task. 
When the RFID reader installed at the entrance of hostel detects 
a  number,  the  system  captures  the  user  image  and  scans  the 
database  for  a  match.  If  both  the  card  and  captured  image 
belong  to  a  registered  user,  access  is  granted;  otherwise  the 
system turns on the alarm and makes an emergency call to the 
security van through GSM modem. In this way, the suspicious 
persons can be caught.

INTRODUCTION
 

 

 

Automatic  identification  and  access  control  system  has 
 
become necessary to overcome the security threats faced by 
many organizations in Pakistan these days. By installing the 
system at the entrance will only allow the authorized persons 
to enter the organization. The system can also be installed at 
various  points  inside  the  organization  to  track  the  person‟s 
movement and to restrict their access to sensitive areas in the 
organization. In such a way, suspicious persons can be caught 
which  will  surely

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  a  wireless 
technology  that  can  be  used  to  develop  the  access  control 
system. The literature has revealed the use of this technology 
to automate various processes ranging from industrial sector 
to home control [1]. Bo Yan [2] has reported the use of RFID 
technology to automate sight spot ticket management system. 
The  system  hardware  consists  of  RFID  electronic  tickets, 
RFID 
terminals,  optical  networks, 
computer  servers  and  site  controllers.  Electronic  ticket 
contains the S-DES encrypted form of data including scenic 
region  number,  scenic  spot  number,  ticket  type,  ticket  date, 
site number, serial number and check bit. The RFID reader at 
the site reads the data inside the e-ticket and transmits it to the 
computer terminal and servers though the network. The data 
is  decrypted  at  the  terminal  and  its  authenticity  is  verified. 
The  site  controller  then  allows  the  right  tourist  to  enter  the 
spot. This system identification and authentication process is 
carried out at three sub-levels namely the sale sub- system, the

decision  sub-system  and  the  management  sub-system.  All 
these  processes  communicate  with  each  other  through 
database  information.  G.  Ostojic  [3]  has  developed  an 
automatic  vehicle  parking  control  system  based  on  RFID 
technology in the city of Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. The 
hardware  of  the  system  consists  of  RFID  tag  and  reader 
operating  at  a  frequency  of  13.56MHz  for  authentication, 
inductive  loop  for  metal  detection,  a  capacity  sensor  for 
counting  vehicles,  Siemens  MC  39i  GPRS  modem  for 
communication  between  entrance  and  exit  gates  and  FEC 
FC440  programmable  logic  controller  (PLC)  which  is  the 
heart of the system. When the car stops on the inductive loop 
at the entrance, RFID tag is read by the reader. The data on the 
tag includes the unique identification number (UID), validity 
period and check bit for checking the parking status. This data 
is manipulated by PLC and access is granted for parking the 
vehicle if tagged information contains  correct  UID,  validity 
period  and  parking  status.  After  the  vehicle  has  entered  the 
parking  lot,  its  parking  status  will  be  changed  by  the  RFID 
reader/writer  to  prevent  the  entry  of  another  vehicle  on  the 
same card. The same procedure is repeated when the vehicle 
is  leaving  the  parking  lot.  Nova  Ahmed  [4]  has  described 
RFID based indoor guidance and monitoring system known 
as  GuardianAngel  in  pervasive  environment.  The  beauty  of 
the system is that it can generate dynamic queries in real time 
through  user  interface.  The  environment  in  the  system  is 
equipped with RFID tags and is divided into various zones. 
The  middleware  of  the  system  is  divided  into  two  layers 
namely  guidance  layer  and  monitoring  layer.  The  guidance 
layer  is  provided  with  handheld  RFID  reader  to  provide 
locality  information  to  the  monitoring  layer  periodically. 
Thus  monitoring  layer  has  the  information  of  the  entire 
environment. Experimental results have shown that system is 
nearly  100%  accurate  in  providing  the  zonal  information 
thereby allowing the construction of very robust guidance and 
monitoring applications. Kuo-shien Huang [5] has described 
a  business  model  based  approach  for  utilizing  RFID 
technology in automating the process according to enterprise 
strategic  vision  and  goals.  The  author  has  built  a  business 
model for bike renting system and used RFID technology to 
implement  the  system.  The  conventional  way  of  getting  the 
bike on rent which includes the recording of customer data by 
pen and then inputting the data to the computer is replaced by 
providing a RFID card to the customer and fixing an RFID tag 
on the bike. The bike is tagged to keep track of its location 
from the renting store to the return store. The information is 
shared amongst the stores through web interface. In this way, 
successful RFID strategy is built and deployed.

monitors VCC for an out-of-tolerance condition. When such a 
condition occurs, the lithium energy source is automatically 
switched on and write protection is unconditionally enabled 
to prevent data corruption. 

 

 

 

G. Door Locks 

Solenoid operated door locks are used in entrance, exit and 
mess gates of hostels. A relay is used to energize the solenoid 
to open the gate. 

H. Alarms 

Two alarms are installed; one at the entrance and other at 
the exit gate. These alarms are turned on if an illegal person 
tries to enter the hostel premises.

The security and access control system is comprised of two 
phases:  registration  phase  and  recognition  phase.  In  the 
registration phase, ten images of the hostel user are captured 
while issuing an RFID tag. These images are used to train a 
feed forward neural network with back propagation training 
algorithm 
stored 
corresponding  to  a  particular  user.  The  recognition  phase 
comes when the user wants to enter the hostel. At this point, 
after getting RFID user number, image of the user is captured 
and passed to the neural network for recognition. If a match is 
found, access is granted to the user. The user authenticity is 
checked at three places: hostel entrance, hostel exit and mess 
entrance. The entrance and exit modules use RFID and face 
recognition  for  identification  while  mess  module  use  RFID 
with  a  password  to  grant  permission.  These  modules 
communicate with computer system through a main controller. 
The main controller transmits the modules information to the 
computer system. The computer system after processing these 
 
interrupts  issues  commands  to  the  modules  through  main 
controller.  The  data  exchange  between  the  main  controller 
and computer system is through serial port while parallel port 
data and control lines are used for handshaking purposes. The 
block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2. 

 

 

A. Entrance Monitoring Controller

Entrance  monitoring  controller  comprises  of  an  RFID 
reader, a GSM modem, a NV RAM, door lock, alarm, scroll 
keys  and  16x4  LCD;  all 
to  AT89C52 
microcontroller  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  After  detecting  and 
receiving  RFID  tag  data  through  a  serial  interrupt  routine, 
microcontroller searches the NV-RAM for this number. If no 
match is found, the microcontroller makes an emergency call 
to the security van through GSM modem. At the same time, it 
sends  a  request  to  the  computer  system  through  main 
controller  to  capture  the  user  image  and  turns  on  the  alarm 
signal.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  match  is  found,  the 
microcontroller  checks  the  entrance  status  of  the  user  by 
scanning NV-RAM. If the user has not entered in the hostel 
yet, the controller sends a request to the computer system to

capture  and  process  the  user  image.  The  computer  system 
performs two functions. First, it verifies the user against the 
received RFID number using face recognition algorithm and 
then  checks  whether  the  user  is  a  defaulter  or  not.  After 
processing,  the  computer  system  generates  one  of  the  three 
messages:  „access  granted‟  corresponding  to  registered  and 
clear user, „access denied‟ corresponding to a non-registered 
user and „user is a defaulter‟ corresponding to a registered and 
defaulter  user.  In  case  of  non-registered  user,  heavy  fine  is 
included in user hostel dues on an account of using the RFID 
tag  of  other  user.  The  entrance  controller  receives  the 
 
message from computer system and displays it on 16×4 LCD. 
The details on LCD can be read with the help of scroll keys. If 
the message „access granted‟ is received by the controller, it 
opens the entrance gate by switching the relay. At the same 
time, entrance status of the user is updated in the non volatile 
RAM. The entrance monitoring module thus ensures the entry 
of  registered  and  clear  users  in  the  hostel  and  also  helps  in 
catching suspicious persons that are not authorized to enter. 
The  flow  chart  describing 
the  operation  of  entrance 
monitoring module is shown in Fig. 4. 

 

 

 

 

and  sends a request to the computer system to capture the user 
image. At the same time, it makes an emergency call through 
GSM modem  interfaced  to  entrance  controller  and  turns  on 
alarm signal. On the other hand, if a „yes‟ signal is received, 
the  exit  controller  sends  a  request  to  computer  system  to 
capture  and  process  user  image.  The  computer  system  uses 
face  recognition  algorithm  to  verify  the  user.  If  a  match  is 
found,  computer  system  asks  the  exit  controller  to  grant 
permission to the user to leave the hostel. After the user has 
left the hostel, exit controller sends a request to the entrance 
 
controller through main controller to update the user entrance 
status. In case of non-registered user, heavy fine is included in 
hostel dues of the user for using the card of other person. The 
exit monitoring controller thus enables the system to allow the 
valid person to leave the hostel. The flow chart describing the 
operation of exit monitoring controller is shown in Fig. 6.

Abstract—This  paper  describes  the  design  of  RFID  based 
security  and  access  control  system  for  use  in  hostels  inside  the 
 
Punjab  University  premises.  The  system  combines  RFID 
technology  and  biometrics  to  accomplish  the  required  task. 
When the RFID reader installed at the entrance of hostel detects 
a  number,  the  system  captures  the  user  image  and  scans  the 
database  for  a  match.  If  both  the  card  and  captured  image 
belong  to  a  registered  user,  access  is  granted;  otherwise  the 
system turns on the alarm and makes an emergency call to the 
security van through GSM modem. In this way, the suspicious 
persons can be caught.

INTRODUCTION
 

 

 

Automatic  identification  and  access  control  system  has 
 
become necessary to overcome the security threats faced by 
many organizations in Pakistan these days. By installing the 
system at the entrance will only allow the authorized persons 
to enter the organization. The system can also be installed at 
various  points  inside  the  organization  to  track  the  person‟s 
movement and to restrict their access to sensitive areas in the 
organization. In such a way, suspicious persons can be caught 
which  will  surely

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  a  wireless 
technology  that  can  be  used  to  develop  the  access  control 
system. The literature has revealed the use of this technology 
to automate various processes ranging from industrial sector 
to home control [1]. Bo Yan [2] has reported the use of RFID 
technology to automate sight spot ticket management system. 
The  system  hardware  consists  of  RFID  electronic  tickets, 
RFID 
terminals,  optical  networks, 
computer  servers  and  site  controllers.  Electronic  ticket 
contains the S-DES encrypted form of data including scenic 
region  number,  scenic  spot  number,  ticket  type,  ticket  date, 
site number, serial number and check bit. The RFID reader at 
the site reads the data inside the e-ticket and transmits it to the 
computer terminal and servers though the network. The data 
is  decrypted  at  the  terminal  and  its  authenticity  is  verified. 
The  site  controller  then  allows  the  right  tourist  to  enter  the 
spot. This system identification and authentication process is 
carried out at three sub-levels namely the sale sub- system, the

decision  sub-system  and  the  management  sub-system.  All 
these  processes  communicate  with  each  other  through 
database  information.  G.  Ostojic  [3]  has  developed  an 
automatic  vehicle  parking  control  system  based  on  RFID 
technology in the city of Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. The 
hardware  of  the  system  consists  of  RFID  tag  and  reader 
operating  at  a  frequency  of  13.56MHz  for  authentication, 
inductive  loop  for  metal  detection,  a  capacity  sensor  for 
counting  vehicles,  Siemens  MC  39i  GPRS  modem  for 
communication  between  entrance  and  exit  gates  and  FEC 
FC440  programmable  logic  controller  (PLC)  which  is  the 
heart of the system. When the car stops on the inductive loop 
at the entrance, RFID tag is read by the reader. The data on the 
tag includes the unique identification number (UID), validity 
period and check bit for checking the parking status. This data 
is manipulated by PLC and access is granted for parking the 
vehicle if tagged information contains  correct  UID,  validity 
period  and  parking  status.  After  the  vehicle  has  entered  the 
parking  lot,  its  parking  status  will  be  changed  by  the  RFID 
reader/writer  to  prevent  the  entry  of  another  vehicle  on  the 
same card. The same procedure is repeated when the vehicle 
is  leaving  the  parking  lot.  Nova  Ahmed  [4]  has  described 
RFID based indoor guidance and monitoring system known 
as  GuardianAngel  in  pervasive  environment.  The  beauty  of 
the system is that it can generate dynamic queries in real time 
through  user  interface.  The  environment  in  the  system  is 
equipped with RFID tags and is divided into various zones. 
The  middleware  of  the  system  is  divided  into  two  layers 
namely  guidance  layer  and  monitoring  layer.  The  guidance 
layer  is  provided  with  handheld  RFID  reader  to  provide 
locality  information  to  the  monitoring  layer  periodically. 
Thus  monitoring  layer  has  the  information  of  the  entire 
environment. Experimental results have shown that system is 
nearly  100%  accurate  in  providing  the  zonal  information 
thereby allowing the construction of very robust guidance and 
monitoring applications. Kuo-shien Huang [5] has described 
a  business  model  based  approach  for  utilizing  RFID 
technology in automating the process according to enterprise 
strategic  vision  and  goals.  The  author  has  built  a  business 
model for bike renting system and used RFID technology to 
implement  the  system.  The  conventional  way  of  getting  the 
bike on rent which includes the recording of customer data by 
pen and then inputting the data to the computer is replaced by 
providing a RFID card to the customer and fixing an RFID tag 
on the bike. The bike is tagged to keep track of its location 
from the renting store to the return store. The information is 
shared amongst the stores through web interface. In this way, 
successful RFID strategy is built and deployed.

by changing the load on its antenna. This variation is actually 
the modulated signal (scheme is known as load modulation)

After the information from these modules is processed by the 
computer, the control commands are issued to the modules for

II. OVERVIEW OF RFID TECHNOLOGY

 

RFID  system  consists  of  three  components  namely 
 
transponder  (tag), 
interrogator  (reader)  and  computer 
containing the database, as shown in Fig. 1. The interrogator 
reads  the  tag  data  and  transmits  it  to  the  computer  for 
authentication.  The  information  is  processed  and  upon 
verification,  access  is  granted.  The  system  offers  diverse 
frequency band ranging from low frequencies to microwave 
frequencies [5]: 

Low Frequency: 125-134 KHz 


 High Frequency: 13.56 MHz 
 Ultra High Frequency: 902-928 MHz 
 Microwave Frequency: 2.4 GHz 

 

 

 

Depending upon the source of electrical energy, RFID tags 
are classified as either active or passive. The active tags use a 
battery for powering the circuit on the tag and transmit the tag 
information upon the reader request. However, these tags are 
very expensive and seldom used. On the other hands, passive 
tags get energy from the reader to power their circuit. These 
tags are very cost-effective and hence most of the applications 
use them. A comparison of these tags highlighting important 
features is shown in Table I [6]-[8]. 

 

In the present work, passive RFID tags have been used. A 
passive RFID tag transmits information to the reader when it 
comes in the vicinity of electromagnetic field generated by the 
reader.  The  phenomenon  is  based  on  Faraday‟s  law  of 
electromagnetic  induction.  The  current  flowing  through  the 
coil of interrogator produces a magnetic field which links to 
the  transponder  coil  thereby  producing  a  current  in  the

Many  researchers  have  utilized  RFID  technology  in 
developing access control system. Filipe [7] has developed an 
RFID based monitoring and access control system consisting 
of RFID terminal, camera, server and an alert device. Upon 
detecting  a  transponder,  the  terminal  captures  a  photo  and 
transmits the data including the UID and photo to the server 
through  TCP/IP  connection.  The  server  searchers  the 
database for this particular query and sends the results back to 
the  terminal  to  allow  or  deny  the  access.  The  system  also 
monitors illicit acts e.g., a person tries to enter when the door 
is  open  without  completion  of  authentication  process  and 
turns on the alert device using web services. The performance 
of the system is tested by installing RFID kits with antennas 
covering a range of 10cm and satisfactory results are obtained. 
Xiang-Lei Meng [9] has described an RFID based embedded 
security  authentication  system  with  novel  face  recognition 
structure.  The  system  comprises  of  two  phases  namely 
 
registration  and  recognition.  In  registration  phase,  ten 
pictures of user face with different emotions are collected and 
eigen  information  is  obtained  with  an  extraction  algorithm. 
 
This information along with a UID is written on RFID tag. In 
recognition phase, a camera tracks the face and an extraction 
algorithm returns eigen information of the face in the picture. 
This information is then matched with the information already 
stored on the tag for authentication. The entire processing is 
done  on  embedded  ARM11  processor,  S3C6410  instead  of 
computer  terminal/server  which  has  resulted  in  faster 
response time, about 57ms with authentication accuracy up to 
86.5%. The performance of the system is compared with the 
existing  database  systems  and  is  found  to  have  far  better 
response  time  with  the  same  authentication  accuracy. 
Dong-Liang Wu [10] has described an access control system 
based on RFID in conjunction with face recognition based on 
neural  network.  The  system  recognizes  the  face  of  person 
holding RFID card and denies the access if person is found to 
be  unauthorized.  Radial  basis  function  neural  network 
(RBFNN) has been used for learning the face of authorized 
persons. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used 
for  extracting  the  features  from  the  image  and  linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) for refining these features. The 
network is trained with localized generalization error model 
(L-GEM)  for  enhancing  its  generalization  capabilities.

Experimental  results  have  shown  that  proposed  system  can 
improve the security of RFID access control. 

IV. SYSTEM COMPONENTS

A. RFID Tag 

IPC80  passive  RFID  tag  operating  at  a  frequency  of 
125KHz is issued to the user. The tag transmits information to 
the reader in ASK format [11]. 

B. RFID Reader 

 

IP10  proximity  card  reader  with  operating  frequency  of 
125KHz  and  reading  distance  up  to  4  inches  is  used.  The 
reader can be easily installed on metal doors, provides the tag 
information  serially  in  RS232  format  and  is  suitable  for 
indoor as well as outdoor operations [11]. Three such readers 
are installed for  hostel  security:  hostel  entrance  gate,  hostel 
exit gate and mess entrance gate. 

 

C. Camera 

Logitech  C500  webcam  is  used  to  capture  images.  The 
camera has 1.3 mega pixel sensors and can capture video up 
to  1280x1024  pixels.  Two  such  cameras  are  installed  for 
hostel security: one at the entrance and other at the exit. No 
camera  is  used  for  entering  in  the  mess  hall  to  reduce  the 
overall complexity. 

 

 

  

D. GSM Modem 

 

 

Nokia 12i GSM modem is used to make emergency call to 
the security van. Nokia 12i offers advance GSM connectivity 
and supports EDGE/GPRS and HSCSD with automated GSM 
connection  establishment  it  is  equipped  to  provide  reliable 
remote  connections  and  offers  application  level  watchdogs, 
 
inbuilt self check mechanisms and a reliable Virtual Machine 
(VM)  for  JAVATM.  Nokia  12i  also  supports  reliable  inbuilt 
internet protocols: TCP/IP for reliable data transfer, UDP/IP 
for audio and video streaming and HTTP for accessing web 
pages. The module can also be connected to an external GPS 
device that supports National Marine Electronics Association 
(NMEA)  standard.  The  inbuilt  NMEA  parser  can  parse  the 
location  data  from  the  output  that  it  receives  from  the  GPS 
device.  External  microcontroller  can  use  AT  commands  to 
communicate  with  Nokia  12i  and  simple  remote  I/O 
applications can easily be controlled via text messages. 

 

E. Microcontroller 

AT89C52  microcontroller  is  selected  because  it  is  a 
powerful microcomputer which has low power consumption 
and provides a highly flexible and cost-effective solution to 
many  embedded  control  applications.  It  has  8K  bytes  of  in 
system reprogrammable flash memory, 256 bytes of internal 
RAM,  32  programmable

F. Nonvolatile RAM 

 

 

 

 

256K Nonvolatile RAM (NV-Ram) DS1230Y-85 is used 
 
for  storing  passwords  against  registered  RFID  numbers. 
NV-RAM is selected because it combines the best of RAM 
and  ROM:  the  read  and  write  ability  of  RAM  and

262,144-bit,  fully  static,  nonvolatile  SRAM  organized  as 
32,768 words by 8 bits. Each NV SRAM has a self-contained 
lithium energy source and control circuitry which constantly 
monitors VCC for an out-of-tolerance condition. When such a 
condition occurs, the lithium energy source is automatically 
switched on and write protection is unconditionally enabled 
to prevent data corruption. 

 

 

 

G. Door Locks 

Solenoid operated door locks are used in entrance, exit and 
mess gates of hostels. A relay is used to energize the solenoid 
to open the gate. 

H. Alarms 

Two alarms are installed; one at the entrance and other at 
the exit gate. These alarms are turned on if an illegal person 
tries to enter the hostel premises.

The security and access control system is comprised of two 
phases:  registration  phase  and  recognition  phase.  In  the 
registration phase, ten images of the hostel user are captured 
while issuing an RFID tag. These images are used to train a 
feed forward neural network with back propagation training 
algorithm 
stored 
corresponding  to  a  particular  user.  The  recognition  phase 
comes when the user wants to enter the hostel. At this point, 
after getting RFID user number, image of the user is captured 
and passed to the neural network for recognition. If a match is 
found, access is granted to the user. The user authenticity is 
checked at three places: hostel entrance, hostel exit and mess 
entrance. The entrance and exit modules use RFID and face 
recognition  for  identification  while  mess  module  use  RFID 
with  a  password  to  grant  permission.  These  modules 
communicate with computer system through a main controller. 
The main controller transmits the modules information to the 
computer system. The computer system after processing these 
 
interrupts  issues  commands  to  the  modules  through  main 
controller.  The  data  exchange  between  the  main  controller 
and computer system is through serial port while parallel port 
data and control lines are used for handshaking purposes. The 
block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2. 

 

 

A. Entrance Monitoring Controller 

 

 

interfaced 

Entrance  monitoring  controller  comprises  of  an  RFID 
reader, a GSM modem, a NV RAM, door lock, alarm, scroll 
keys  and  16x4  LCD;  all 
to  AT89C52 
microcontroller  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  After  detecting  and 
receiving  RFID  tag  data  through  a  serial  interrupt  routine, 
microcontroller searches the NV-RAM for this number. If no 
match is found, the microcontroller makes an emergency call 
to the security van through GSM modem. At the same time, it 
sends  a  request  to  the  computer  system  through  main 
controller  to  capture  the  user  image  and  turns  on  the  alarm 
signal.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  match  is  found,  the 
microcontroller  checks  the  entrance  status  of  the  user  by 
scanning NV-RAM. If the user has not entered in the hostel 
yet, the controller sends a request to the computer system to 

311

and Technology, Vol. 6, No. 4, August 2014

 

capture  and  process  the  user  image.  The  computer  system 
performs two functions. First, it verifies the user against the 
received RFID number using face recognition algorithm and 
then  checks  whether  the  user  is  a  defaulter  or  not.  After 
processing,  the  computer  system  generates  one  of  the  three 
messages:  „access  granted‟  corresponding  to  registered  and 
clear user, „access denied‟ corresponding to a non-registered 
user and „user is a defaulter‟ corresponding to a registered and 
defaulter  user.  In  case  of  non-registered  user,  heavy  fine  is 
included in user hostel dues on an account of using the RFID 
tag  of  other  user.  The  entrance  controller  receives  the 
 
message from computer system and displays it on 16×4 LCD. 
The details on LCD can be read with the help of scroll keys. If 
the message „access granted‟ is received by the controller, it 
opens the entrance gate by switching the relay. At the same 
time, entrance status of the user is updated in the non volatile 
RAM. The entrance monitoring module thus ensures the entry 
of  registered  and  clear  users  in  the  hostel  and  also  helps  in 
catching suspicious persons that are not authorized to enter. 
The  flow  chart  describing 
the  operation  of  entrance 
monitoring module is shown in Fig. 4. 

 

 

 

 

and  sends a request to the computer system to capture the user 
image. At the same time, it makes an emergency call through 
GSM modem  interfaced  to  entrance  controller  and  turns  on 
alarm signal. On the other hand, if a „yes‟ signal is received, 
the  exit  controller  sends  a  request  to  computer  system  to 
capture  and  process  user  image.  The  computer  system  uses 
face  recognition  algorithm  to  verify  the  user.  If  a  match  is

permission to the user to leave the hostel. After the user has 
left the hostel, exit controller sends a request to the entrance 
 
controller through main controller to update the user entrance 
status. In case of non-registered user, heavy fine is included in 
hostel dues of the user for using the card of other person. The 
exit monitoring controller thus enables the system to allow the 
valid person to leave the hostel. The flow chart describing the 
operation of exit monitoring controller is shown in Fig. 6.

mess  attendance  system.  The  mess  monitoring  module 
comprises  of  an  RFID  reader,  4x3  keypad,  16x4  LCD,  a 
NV-RAM,  door  lock  and  alarm  indicator;  all  interfaced  to 
AT89C52 microcontroller as shown in Fig. 7. Upon receiving 
RFID  tag  number,  the  controller  searches  it  in  a  list  of 
registered numbers stored in NV-RAM. If a match is found, 
controller asks the user to enter the password. The password 
list  of  registered  users  is  also  maintained  in  NV-RAM 
corresponding to RFID tag numbers. If the entered password 
is correct, controller grants access to the user for entering the 
mess  hall.  At  the  same  time,  controller  sends  the  user 
information  along  with  mess  attendance  to  the  computer 
system  through  main  controller.  The  computer  system 
updates  the  database  and  sends  „attendance  recorded‟ 
message  to  the  mess  controller.  In  this  way,  the  exact  mess 
charges  are  maintained  in  on-line  database.  The  flow  chart 
describing  the  operation  of  mess  monitoring  controller  is

Abstract—This  paper  describes  the  design  of  RFID  based 
security  and  access  control  system  for  use  in  hostels  inside  the 
 
Punjab  University  premises.  The  system  combines  RFID 
technology  and  biometrics  to  accomplish  the  required  task. 
When the RFID reader installed at the entrance of hostel detects 
a  number,  the  system  captures  the  user  image  and  scans  the 
database  for  a  match.  If  both  the  card  and  captured  image 
belong  to  a  registered  user,  access  is  granted;  otherwise  the 
system turns on the alarm and makes an emergency call to the 
security van through GSM modem. In this way, the suspicious

INTRODUCTION
 

 

 

Automatic  identification  and  access  control  system  has 
 
become necessary to overcome the security threats faced by 
many organizations in Pakistan these days. By installing the 
system at the entrance will only allow the authorized persons 
to enter the organization. The system can also be installed at 
various  points  inside  the  organization  to  track  the  person‟s 
movement and to restrict their access to sensitive areas in the 
organization. In such a way, suspicious persons can be caught 
which  will  surely

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  a  wireless 
technology  that  can  be  used  to  develop  the  access  control 
system. The literature has revealed the use of this technology 
to automate various processes ranging from industrial sector 
to home control [1]. Bo Yan [2] has reported the use of RFID 
technology to automate sight spot ticket management system. 
The  system  hardware  consists  of  RFID  electronic  tickets, 
RFID 
terminals,  optical  networks, 
computer  servers  and  site  controllers.  Electronic  ticket 
contains the S-DES encrypted form of data including scenic 
region  number,  scenic  spot  number,  ticket  type,  ticket  date, 
site number, serial number and check bit. The RFID reader at 
the site reads the data inside the e-ticket and transmits it to the 
computer terminal and servers though the network. The data 
is  decrypted  at  the  terminal  and  its  authenticity  is  verified. 
The  site  controller  then  allows  the  right  tourist  to  enter  the 
spot. This system identification and authentication process is 
carried out at three sub-levels namely the sale sub- system, the

decision  sub-system  and  the  management  sub-system.  All 
these  processes  communicate  with  each  other  through 
database  information.  G.  Ostojic  [3]  has  developed  an 
automatic  vehicle  parking  control  system  based  on  RFID 
technology in the city of Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. The 
hardware  of  the  system  consists  of  RFID  tag  and  reader 
operating  at  a  frequency  of  13.56MHz  for  authentication, 
inductive  loop  for  metal  detection,  a  capacity  sensor  for 
counting  vehicles,  Siemens  MC  39i  GPRS  modem  for 
communication  between  entrance  and  exit  gates  and  FEC 
FC440  programmable  logic  controller  (PLC)  which  is  the 
heart of the system. When the car stops on the inductive loop 
at the entrance, RFID tag is read by the reader. The data on the 
tag includes the unique identification number (UID), validity 
period and check bit for checking the parking status. This data 
is manipulated by PLC and access is granted for parking the 
vehicle if tagged information contains  correct  UID,  validity 
period  and  parking  status.  After  the  vehicle  has  entered  the 
parking  lot,  its  parking  status  will  be  changed  by  the  RFID 
reader/writer  to  prevent  the  entry  of  another  vehicle  on  the 
same card. The same procedure is repeated when the vehicle 
is  leaving  the  parking  lot.  Nova  Ahmed  [4]  has  described 
RFID based indoor guidance and monitoring system known 
as  GuardianAngel  in  pervasive  environment.  The  beauty  of 
the system is that it can generate dynamic queries in real time 
through  user  interface.  The  environment  in  the  system  is 
equipped with RFID tags and is divided into various zones. 
The  middleware  of  the  system  is  divided  into  two  layers 
namely  guidance  layer  and  monitoring  layer.  The  guidance 
layer  is  provided  with  handheld  RFID  reader  to  provide 
locality  information  to  the  monitoring  layer  periodically. 
Thus  monitoring  layer  has  the  information  of  the  entire 
environment. Experimental results have shown that system is 
nearly  100%  accurate  in  providing  the  zonal  information 
thereby allowing the construction of very robust guidance and 
monitoring applications. Kuo-shien Huang [5] has described 
a  business  model  based  approach  for  utilizing  RFID 
technology in automating the process according to enterprise 
strategic  vision  and  goals.  The  author  has  built  a  business 
model for bike renting system and used RFID technology to 
implement  the  system.  The  conventional  way  of  getting  the 
bike on rent which includes the recording of customer data by 
pen and then inputting the data to the computer is replaced by 
providing a RFID card to the customer and fixing an RFID tag 
on the bike. The bike is tagged to keep track of its location 
from the renting store to the return store. The information is 
shared amongst the stores through web interface. In this way, 
successful RFID strategy is built and deployed.

transponder coil. The transponder coil then varies this current 
by changing the load on its antenna. This variation is actually 
the modulated signal (scheme is known as load modulation) 
which  is  received  by  the  interrogator  coil  through  mutual 
induction  between  the  coils.  The  interrogator  coil  decodes

After the information from these modules is processed by the 
computer, the control commands are issued to the modules for 
granting or denying access to the user.

II. OVERVIEW OF RFID TECHNOLOGY

 

RFID  system  consists  of  three  components  namely 
 
transponder  (tag), 
interrogator  (reader)  and  computer 
containing the database, as shown in Fig. 1. The interrogator 
reads  the  tag  data  and  transmits  it  to  the  computer  for 
authentication.  The  information  is  processed  and  upon 
verification,  access  is  granted.  The  system  offers  diverse 
frequency band ranging from low frequencies to microwave 
frequencies [5]: 

Low Frequency: 125-134 KHz 


 High Frequency: 13.56 MHz 
 Ultra High Frequency: 902-928 MHz 
 Microwave Frequency: 2.4 GHz 

 

 

 

Depending upon the source of electrical energy, RFID tags 
are classified as either active or passive. The active tags use a 
battery for powering the circuit on the tag and transmit the tag 
information upon the reader request. However, these tags are 
very expensive and seldom used. On the other hands, passive 
tags get energy from the reader to power their circuit. These 
tags are very cost-effective and hence most of the applications 
use them. A comparison of these tags highlighting important 
features is shown in Table I [6]-[8]. 

 

In the present work, passive RFID tags have been used. A 
passive RFID tag transmits information to the reader when it 
comes in the vicinity of electromagnetic field generated by the 
reader.  The  phenomenon  is  based  on  Faraday‟s  law  of 
electromagnetic  induction.  The  current  flowing  through  the 
coil of interrogator produces a magnetic field which links to 
the  transponder  coil  thereby  producing  a  current  in  the

Many  researchers  have  utilized  RFID  technology  in 
developing access control system. Filipe [7] has developed an 
RFID based monitoring and access control system consisting 
of RFID terminal, camera, server and an alert device. Upon 
detecting  a  transponder,  the  terminal  captures  a  photo  and 
transmits the data including the UID and photo to the server 
through  TCP/IP  connection.  The  server  searchers  the 
database for this particular query and sends the results back to 
the  terminal  to  allow  or  deny  the  access.  The  system  also 
monitors illicit acts e.g., a person tries to enter when the door 
is  open  without  completion  of  authentication  process  and 
turns on the alert device using web services. The performance 
of the system is tested by installing RFID kits with antennas 
covering a range of 10cm and satisfactory results are obtained. 
Xiang-Lei Meng [9] has described an RFID based embedded 
security  authentication  system  with  novel  face  recognition 
structure.  The  system  comprises  of  two  phases  namely 
 
registration  and  recognition.  In  registration  phase,  ten 
pictures of user face with different emotions are collected and 
eigen  information  is  obtained  with  an  extraction  algorithm. 
 
This information along with a UID is written on RFID tag. In 
recognition phase, a camera tracks the face and an extraction 
algorithm returns eigen information of the face in the picture. 
This information is then matched with the information already 
stored on the tag for authentication. The entire processing is 
done  on  embedded  ARM11  processor,  S3C6410  instead  of 
computer  terminal/server  which  has  resulted  in  faster 
response time, about 57ms with authentication accuracy up to 
86.5%. The performance of the system is compared with the 
existing  database  systems  and  is  found  to  have  far  better 
response  time  with  the  same  authentication  accuracy. 
Dong-Liang Wu [10] has described an access control system 
based on RFID in conjunction with face recognition based on 
neural  network.  The  system  recognizes  the  face  of  person 
holding RFID card and denies the access if person is found to 
be  unauthorized.  Radial  basis  function  neural  network 
(RBFNN) has been used for learning the face of authorized 
persons. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used 
for  extracting  the  features  from  the  image  and  linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) for refining these features. The 
network is trained with localized generalization error model 
(L-GEM)  for  enhancing  its  generalization  capabilities.

Experimental  results  have  shown  that  proposed  system  can 
improve the security of RFID access control. 

IV. SYSTEM COMPONENTS

A. RFID Tag 

IPC80  passive  RFID  tag  operating  at  a  frequency  of 
125KHz is issued to the user. The tag transmits information to 
the reader in ASK format [11]. 

B. RFID Reader 

 

IP10  proximity  card  reader  with  operating  frequency  of 
125KHz  and  reading  distance  up  to  4  inches  is  used.  The 
reader can be easily installed on metal doors, provides the tag 
information  serially  in  RS232  format  and  is  suitable  for 
indoor as well as outdoor operations [11]. Three such readers 
are installed for  hostel  security:  hostel  entrance  gate,  hostel 
exit gate and mess entrance gate. 

 

C. Camera 

Logitech  C500  webcam  is  used  to  capture  images.  The 
camera has 1.3 mega pixel sensors and can capture video up 
to  1280x1024  pixels.  Two  such  cameras  are  installed  for 
hostel security: one at the entrance and other at the exit. No 
camera  is  used  for  entering  in  the  mess  hall  to  reduce  the 
overall complexity. 

 

 

  

D. GSM Modem 

 

 

Nokia 12i GSM modem is used to make emergency call to 
the security van. Nokia 12i offers advance GSM connectivity 
and supports EDGE/GPRS and HSCSD with automated GSM 
connection  establishment  it  is  equipped  to  provide  reliable 
remote  connections  and  offers  application  level  watchdogs, 
 
inbuilt self check mechanisms and a reliable Virtual Machine 
(VM)  for  JAVATM.  Nokia  12i  also  supports  reliable  inbuilt 
internet protocols: TCP/IP for reliable data transfer, UDP/IP 
for audio and video streaming and HTTP for accessing web 
pages. The module can also be connected to an external GPS 
device that supports National Marine Electronics Association 
(NMEA)  standard.  The  inbuilt  NMEA  parser  can  parse  the 
location  data  from  the  output  that  it  receives  from  the  GPS 
device.  External  microcontroller  can  use  AT  commands  to 
communicate  with  Nokia  12i  and  simple  remote  I/O 
applications can easily be controlled via text messages. 

 

E. Microcontroller 

AT89C52  microcontroller  is  selected  because  it  is  a 
powerful microcomputer which has low power consumption 
and provides a highly flexible and cost-effective solution to 
many  embedded  control  applications.  It  has  8K  bytes  of  in 
system reprogrammable flash memory, 256 bytes of internal 
RAM,  32  programmable 
three  16  bit 
timers/counters, eight interrupt sources and a programmable 
serial channel [11].

F. Nonvolatile RAM 

 

 

 

 

256K Nonvolatile RAM (NV-Ram) DS1230Y-85 is used 
 
for  storing  passwords  against  registered  RFID  numbers. 
NV-RAM is selected because it combines the best of RAM 
and  ROM:  the  read  and  write  ability  of  RAM  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-volatility  of  ROM.  The  DS1230  Nonvolatile  SRAM  is 
262,144-bit,  fully  static,  nonvolatile  SRAM  organized  as 
32,768 words by 8 bits. Each NV SRAM has a self-contained 
lithium energy source and control circuitry which constantly 
monitors VCC for an out-of-tolerance condition. When such a 
condition occurs, the lithium energy source is automatically 
switched on and write protection is unconditionally enabled 
to prevent data corruption. 

 

 

 

G. Door Locks 

Solenoid operated door locks are used in entrance, exit and 
mess gates of hostels. A relay is used to energize the solenoid 
to open the gate. 

H. Alarms 

Two alarms are installed; one at the entrance and other at 
the exit gate. These alarms are turned on if an illegal person 
tries to enter the hostel premises.

The security and access control system is comprised of two 
phases:  registration  phase  and  recognition  phase.  In  the 
registration phase, ten images of the hostel user are captured 
while issuing an RFID tag. These images are used to train a 
feed forward neural network with back propagation training 
algorithm 
stored 
corresponding  to  a  particular  user.  The  recognition  phase 
comes when the user wants to enter the hostel. At this point, 
after getting RFID user number, image of the user is captured 
and passed to the neural network for recognition. If a match is 
found, access is granted to the user. The user authenticity is 
checked at three places: hostel entrance, hostel exit and mess 
entrance. The entrance and exit modules use RFID and face 
recognition  for  identification  while  mess  module  use  RFID 
with  a  password  to  grant  permission.  These  modules 
communicate with computer system through a main controller. 
The main controller transmits the modules information to the 
computer system. The computer system after processing these 
 
interrupts  issues  commands  to  the  modules  through  main 
controller.  The  data  exchange  between  the  main  controller 
and computer system is through serial port while parallel port 
data and control lines are used for handshaking purposes. The 
block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2. 

 

 

A. Entrance Monitoring Controller 

 

 

interfaced 

Entrance  monitoring  controller  comprises  of  an  RFID 
reader, a GSM modem, a NV RAM, door lock, alarm, scroll 
keys  and  16x4  LCD;  all 
to  AT89C52 
microcontroller  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  After  detecting  and 
receiving  RFID  tag  data  through  a  serial  interrupt  routine, 
microcontroller searches the NV-RAM for this number. If no 
match is found, the microcontroller makes an emergency call 
to the security van through GSM modem. At the same time, it 
sends  a  request  to  the  computer  system  through  main 
controller  to  capture  the  user  image  and  turns  on  the  alarm 
signal.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  match  is  found,  the 
microcontroller  checks  the  entrance  status  of  the  user  by 
scanning NV-RAM. If the user has not entered in the hostel 
yet, the controller sends a request to the computer system to 

311

 

IACSIT International Journal of 

and Technology, Vol. 6, No. 4, August 2014

 

capture  and  process  the  user  image.  The  computer  system 
performs two functions. First, it verifies the user against the 
received RFID number using face recognition algorithm and 
then  checks  whether  the  user  is  a  defaulter  or  not.  After 
processing,  the  computer  system  generates  one  of  the  three 
messages:  „access  granted‟  corresponding  to  registered  and 
clear user, „access denied‟ corresponding to a non-registered 
user and „user is a defaulter‟ corresponding to a registered and 
defaulter  user.  In  case  of  non-registered  user,  heavy  fine  is 
included in user hostel dues on an account of using the RFID 
tag  of  other  user.  The  entrance  controller  receives  the 
 
message from computer system and displays it on 16×4 LCD. 
The details on LCD can be read with the help of scroll keys. If 
the message „access granted‟ is received by the controller, it 
opens the entrance gate by switching the relay. At the same 
time, entrance status of the user is updated in the non volatile 
RAM. The entrance monitoring module thus ensures the entry 
of  registered  and  clear  users  in  the  hostel  and  also  helps  in 
catching suspicious persons that are not authorized to enter. 
The  flow  chart  describing 
the  operation  of  entrance 
monitoring module is shown in Fig. 4. 

 

 

 

 

and  sends a request to the computer system to capture the user 
image. At the same time, it makes an emergency call through 
GSM modem  interfaced  to  entrance  controller  and  turns  on 
alarm signal. On the other hand, if a „yes‟ signal is received, 
the  exit  controller  sends  a  request  to  computer  system  to 
capture  and  process  user  image.  The  computer  system  uses 
face  recognition  algorithm  to  verify  the  user.  If  a  match  is 
found,  computer  system  asks  the  exit  controller  to  grant 
permission to the user to leave the hostel. After the user has 
left the hostel, exit controller sends a request to the entrance 
 
controller through main controller to update the user entrance 
status. In case of non-registered user, heavy fine is included in 
hostel dues of the user for using the card of other person. The 
exit monitoring controller thus enables the system to allow the 
valid person to leave the hostel. The flow chart describing the 
operation of exit monitoring controller is shown in Fig. 6.

security  and  access  control  system  is  installed  in  eighteen 
hostels  and  computer  systems  in  these  hostels  share  the 
information to a web server which is the central station and 
can be searched to locate a particular user inside the hostels.

While  entrance  and  exit  monitoring  controllers  help  in 
tracking the users, mess monitoring controller automates the 
mess  attendance  system.  The  mess  monitoring  module 
comprises  of  an  RFID  reader,  4x3  keypad,  16x4  LCD,  a 
NV-RAM,  door  lock  and  alarm  indicator;  all  interfaced  to 
AT89C52 microcontroller as shown in Fig. 7. Upon receiving 
RFID  tag  number,  the  controller  searches  it  in  a  list  of 
registered numbers stored in NV-RAM. If a match is found, 
controller asks the user to enter the password. The password 
list  of  registered  users  is  also  maintained  in  NV-RAM 
corresponding to RFID tag numbers. If the entered password 
is correct, controller grants access to the user for entering the 
mess  hall.  At  the  same  time,  controller  sends  the  user 
information  along  with  mess  attendance  to  the  computer 
system  through  main  controller.  The  computer  system 
updates  the  database  and  sends  „attendance  recorded‟ 
message  to  the  mess  controller.  In  this  way,  the  exact  mess 
charges  are  maintained  in  on-line  database.  The  flow  chart 
describing  the  operation  of  mess  monitoring  controller  is 
shown in Fig. 8.

D. Computer System and Web Server 

The  information  provided  by  the  system  modules  is 
maintained  in  a  database  inside  the  computer  system.  The 
database keeps record of user history including check-in time 
and date, check-out time and date, electricity, gas and mess 
charges,  fine  (penalty)  details,  RFID  card  lost  details  and 
user‟s visitor record. In addition to this, database also keeps 
record of illegal persons trying to enter the hostel premises. A 
screen short of a user form in database is shown in Fig. 9. The

VI. CONCLUSIONS

radio 

frequency 

In this paper, design of a security and access control system 
for use in Punjab University hostels is presented. The system 
uses 
identification  with  biometrics 
technology  to  differentiate  between  valid  and  invalid  users. 
The system accomplishes the security and access control task 
by  processing  information  from  sub-controllers.  These 
controllers  include  entrance  monitoring  controller,  exit 
monitoring  controller  and  mess  monitoring  controller 
installed at entrance gate, exit gate and mess gate respectively. 
These controllers read RFID tag issued to the user and search

this tag number in non-volatile RAM. On a successful match, 
the controllers  request  the  computer  terminal  to  capture  the 
user image. The computer system uses neural network trained 
face  recognition  module  to  verify  the  user  authenticity  and 
responds to the controllers by sending them „access granted‟ 
or „access denied‟ message. The controllers grant the access 
to the user or make emergency call accordingly. This system 
is made centralized with the help of a web server. The web 
server takes information from computer terminals in hostels 
and keeps track of a particular user. Although the developed 
system  is  useful  in  reducing  security  threats  to  the  hostels, 
there is a room for improvement in the response time of the 
system.  The  response  time  can  be  improved  by  using 
dedicated processors instead of computer systems capable of 
processing the images in real time.
