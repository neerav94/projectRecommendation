Abstract:  Information  security  became  main  concern  because  information  and  communication  technology  is  developing 
dynamically  today.  Many  problems  can  occur  if  there  is  no  information  security  issue.  At  the  same  time,  security  for 
multimedia data is also important criteria. Cryptographic techniques are used to overcome these security problems. Meanwhile, 
steganographic  techniques  are  developed  to  enhance  the  information  security  systems.  Steganography  is  the  method  to  hide 
secret information into another carrier file such as text, image, audio, and video. If the more robust information security system 
is  needed  than  the  ordinary  information  security  system,  cryptographic  algorithm  can  be  combined  with  steganographic 
technique. This paper proposes the combination of a cryptographic algorithm and a steganographic method to obtain the high 
level  of  information  security.  In  this  proposed  system,  secret  audio  message  is  encrypted  with  the  help  of  AES  encryption 
algorithm  and  then  the  encrypted  audio  message  is  embedded  into  a  cover  image  by  using  LSB  technique.  This  system  is 
implemented by C# programming language.

I. INTRODUCTION 

      Today,  information  is  vital  in  all  areas  such  as  business, 
military  and  social  affairs.  Therefore, 
the  security  of 
information  is  also  important  to  fulfill  the  information 
security  requirements  of  above  areas.  Cryptography  and 
steganography are the branches of information security field. 
In the cryptography point of view, symmetric and public key 
algorithms  are  available.  Symmetric  encryption  is  called 
conventional  cryptography.  In  conventional  cryptography, 
the  same  secret  key  is  shared  by  the  sender  and  receiver.  In 
public key algorithms or asymmetric encryption, private and 
public  keys  are  used  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  data.  Both 
approaches have not only advantages but also disadvantages. 
Symmetric  algorithms  are  widely  used  to  encrypt  the  vast 
amount of data than public key algorithms. Steganography is 
a  technique  in  which  secret  data  is  embedded  into  the  cover 
file  such  as  text,  image,  audio,  video,  etc.  There  are  many 
steganographic techniques to  embed data into the cover file.

requirements  are:  Confidentiality  means 

A. Cryptography 
     Cryptography is the art of achieving security by encoding 
message to make them non-readable and the science of using 
mathematics  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  data.  It  enables  to  store 
sensitive information or transmit it across insecure  networks 
(like the internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except 
the  intended  recipient  [4].  The  security  goals  to  meet  the 
security 
that 
unauthorized parties cannot access information.  Authenticity 
refers  to  validating  the  source  of  the  message  to  ensure  the 
sender  is  properly  identified.  Integrity  provides  assurance 
that  the  message  was  not  modified  during  transmission, 
accidentally  or  intentionally.  Non-repudiation  means  that  a 
sender  cannot  deny  sending  the  message  at  a  later  date,  and 
the  receiver  cannot  deny  receiving  it  [5].  In  cryptography, 
encryption algorithms can be categorized into symmetric key 
(private) and asymmetric (public) key [6]. 

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of symmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     With  symmetric  encryption,  confidentiality  is  guaranteed 
by the use of a secret  key as  shown in Figure 1. To achieve 
confidentiality, symmetric cryptographic algorithms are used. 

Figure2. Schematic diagram of asymmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     Public-key  cryptography  solves 
the  key-distribution 
problem by making a scheme that uses two keys, public key 
and  private  key,  rather  than  one  [7].  It  uses  a  pair  of  keys: 
one  that  encrypts  the  data  and  one  that  decrypts  the  data  as 
shown in Figure 2. It is also called public key cryptosystems. 
In  these  two  types  of  encryption  techniques,  symmetric 
cryptographic systems are popular for high speed encryption 
and  low  cipher  expansion  rate,  comparing  to  asymmetric 
cryptosystems.  The  proposed  system  uses  Advanced 
Encryption  Standard  (AES), 
the  symmetric  encryption 
algorithm. 

[8]. The term steganography is derived from the Greek word 
“stegano”  means  “covered”  and  “graphy”  means  “writing”. 
The  goal  of  steganography  is  to  hide  message  inside  other 
harmless message in a way that does not allow any enemy to 
even detect that there is a second secret message present [8]. 
It  includes  a  vast  array  of  secret  communications  methods 
that conceal the message’s existence. Most of steganography 
works have been carried out on image, video, audio and text 
as shown in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3. Types of steganography. 

     Among those various carrier media, image steganography 
is  very  popular  to  hide  information  in  it.  In  this  proposed 
system, image steganography is used to hide secret audio file. 
LSB  (Least  Significant  Bit)  algorithm  is  used  in  this 
proposed system.  

IV.BACKGROUND THEORIES OF PROPOSED 

SYSTEM 

     To develop the proposed system, cryptographic symmetric 
encryption algorithm;  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
is  used  for  data  encryption.  To  create  image  steganography, 
Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  method  is  used  to  hide  the 
encrypted data into the cover image file. 

A. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
     AES  is  Advanced  Encryption  Standard,  a  United  States 
government standard algorithm for encryption and decryption 
data.  AES  is  a  symmetric  block  cipher  with  a  block  size  of 
128  bits.  This  means  that  it  uses  the  same  key  for  both 
encryption and decryption.  AES Key lengths can be 128 bits, 
192  bits,  or  256  bits;  called  AES-128,  AES-192  and  AES-
256, respectively. AES-128 uses 10 rounds, AES-192 uses 12 
rounds and AES-256 uses 14 rounds. The rounds operate on 
two  128-bit  inputs:  “State”  and  “Round  key”  [9].          These 
operate  on  a  4x4  arrays  of  bytes,  termed  the  state.  The 
proposed  system  used  128  bits  and  128  bits  key  size.  For 
complete  encryption,  the  data  is  passed  through  10  rounds. 
The algorithm begins with AddRoundKey stage followed by 
9 rounds of four stages and a tenth round of three stages. This 
applies  for  both  encryption  and  decryption  with 
the 
expansion that each stage of a round the decryption algorithm 
is  the  inverse  of  its  counterpart  in  the  encryption  algorithm. 
The four stages are as follows:

     To develop the proposed system, cryptographic symmetric 
encryption algorithm;  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

     Again,  the  tenth  round  simply  leaves  out  the  Inverse 
MixColumns  stage  [10].  Each  of  these  stages  is  in  more 
detail  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  SubBytes(  )  adds  confusion  by 
processing  each  byte  through  an  S-Box.  An  S-Box  is  a 
substitution  table,  where  one  byte  is  substitution  algorithm. 
ShiftRows( ) provides diffusion by mixing data  within rows. 
Row zero of the State is not shifted, row 1 is 1 byte, row 2 is 
shifted 2 bytes and row 3 is  shifted 3 bytes.  MixColumns(  ) 
also provides diffusion by mixing data within columns. The 4 
bytes  of  each  column  in  the  State  are  treated  as  a  4-byte 
number and transformed to another 4-byte  number  via  finite 
field  mathematics.  AddRoundKey(  )  performs  the  actual 
‘encryption’, when each bytes in the State is XORed with the 
sub  key.  The  subkey  is  derived  from  the  key  according  to  a 
key expansion schedule. AES key Expansion( ) The AES key 
expansion algorithm takes input a 4-word (16-bytes) key and 
produces  a  linear  array  of  44  words,  providing  a  4-word 

round key for initial AddRoundKey stage and each of the 10 
rounds of the cipher [1].   

B. Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
      Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  insertion  is  a  common, 
simple approach to embedding information in a cover image. 
Image is composed of bits of RGB values.  R stands  for red, 
G stand for green and B stands for blue. After that, the least 
significant bit of  some or all  of the bytes inside an image is 
changed  to  a  bit  of  each  of  the  Red,  Green  and  Blue  color 
components  so  that  they  can  be  used,  since  they  are  each 
represented  by  a  byte.  In  other  words  one  can  store  3  bit  in 
each pixel. An 800*600 pixel image can store a total amount 
of  1,440,000  bits  or  180,000  bytes  of  embedded  data.  For 
example  a  grid  for  3  pixels  of  a  24  bit  image  can  be  as 
follows: 
      (00101101    00011100    11011100) 
      (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
      (11010010    10101101    01100011) 
 
     When  the  letter  A,  which  binary  representation  is 
01000001  and  is  embedded  into  the  least  significant  bits  of 
this part of the image, the resulting grid is as follows: 
     (00101100    00011101    11011100) 
     (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
     (11010010    10101101    01100011) 

     Although the letter was embedded into the first 8 bytes of 
the  grid,  only  the  two  highlighted  bits  need  to  be  changed 
according to the embedded message. On average only half of 
the bit in an image  will need to be modified to hide a secret 
message  using  the  maximum  cover  size.  The  proposed 
system is designed to embed  the data (encrypted audio) into 
an  image.  The  least  significant  bit  of  each  byte  of  image  is 
substituted by the binary bit of data and then the stego-image 
is produced [11].

Abstract:  Information  security  became  main  concern  because  information  and  communication  technology  is  developing 
dynamically  today.  Many  problems  can  occur  if  there  is  no  information  security  issue.  At  the  same  time,  security  for 
multimedia data is also important criteria. Cryptographic techniques are used to overcome these security problems. Meanwhile, 
steganographic  techniques  are  developed  to  enhance  the  information  security  systems.  Steganography  is  the  method  to  hide 
secret information into another carrier file such as text, image, audio, and video. If the more robust information security system 
is  needed  than  the  ordinary  information  security  system,  cryptographic  algorithm  can  be  combined  with  steganographic 
technique. This paper proposes the combination of a cryptographic algorithm and a steganographic method to obtain the high 
level  of  information  security.  In  this  proposed  system,  secret  audio  message  is  encrypted  with  the  help  of  AES  encryption 
algorithm  and  then  the  encrypted  audio  message  is  embedded  into  a  cover  image  by  using  LSB  technique.  This  system  is

I. INTRODUCTION 

      Today,  information  is  vital  in  all  areas  such  as  business, 
military  and  social  affairs.  Therefore, 
the  security  of 
information  is  also  important  to  fulfill  the  information 
security  requirements  of  above  areas.  Cryptography  and 
steganography are the branches of information security field. 
In the cryptography point of view, symmetric and public key 
algorithms  are  available.  Symmetric  encryption  is  called 
conventional  cryptography.  In  conventional  cryptography, 
the  same  secret  key  is  shared  by  the  sender  and  receiver.  In 
public key algorithms or asymmetric encryption, private and 
public  keys  are  used  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  data.  Both 
approaches have not only advantages but also disadvantages. 
Symmetric  algorithms  are  widely  used  to  encrypt  the  vast 
amount of data than public key algorithms. Steganography is 
a  technique  in  which  secret  data  is  embedded  into  the  cover 
file  such  as  text,  image,  audio,  video,  etc.  There  are  many

requirements  are:  Confidentiality  means 

A. Cryptography 
     Cryptography is the art of achieving security by encoding 
message to make them non-readable and the science of using 
mathematics  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  data.  It  enables  to  store 
sensitive information or transmit it across insecure  networks 
(like the internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except 
the  intended  recipient  [4].  The  security  goals  to  meet  the 
security 
that 
unauthorized parties cannot access information.  Authenticity 
refers  to  validating  the  source  of  the  message  to  ensure  the 
sender  is  properly  identified.  Integrity  provides  assurance 
that  the  message  was  not  modified  during  transmission, 
accidentally  or  intentionally.  Non-repudiation  means  that  a 
sender  cannot  deny  sending  the  message  at  a  later  date,  and 
the  receiver  cannot  deny  receiving  it  [5].  In  cryptography, 
encryption algorithms can be categorized into symmetric key 
(private) and asymmetric (public) key [6]. 

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of symmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     With  symmetric  encryption,  confidentiality  is  guaranteed 
by the use of a secret  key as  shown in Figure 1. To achieve 
confidentiality, symmetric cryptographic algorithms are used. 

Figure2. Schematic diagram of asymmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     Public-key  cryptography  solves 
the  key-distribution 
problem by making a scheme that uses two keys, public key 
and  private  key,  rather  than  one  [7].  It  uses  a  pair  of  keys: 
one  that  encrypts  the  data  and  one  that  decrypts  the  data  as 
shown in Figure 2. It is also called public key cryptosystems. 
In  these  two  types  of  encryption  techniques,  symmetric 
cryptographic systems are popular for high speed encryption 
and  low  cipher  expansion  rate,  comparing  to  asymmetric 
cryptosystems.  The  proposed  system  uses  Advanced 
Encryption  Standard  (AES), 
the  symmetric  encryption 
algorithm. 

[8]. The term steganography is derived from the Greek word 
“stegano”  means  “covered”  and  “graphy”  means  “writing”. 
The  goal  of  steganography  is  to  hide  message  inside  other 
harmless message in a way that does not allow any enemy to 
even detect that there is a second secret message present [8]. 
It  includes  a  vast  array  of  secret  communications  methods 
that conceal the message’s existence. Most of steganography 
works have been carried out on image, video, audio and text 
as shown in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3. Types of steganography. 

     Among those various carrier media, image steganography 
is  very  popular  to  hide  information  in  it.  In  this  proposed 
system, image steganography is used to hide secret audio file. 
LSB  (Least  Significant  Bit)  algorithm  is  used  in  this 
proposed system.  

IV.BACKGROUND THEORIES OF PROPOSED 

SYSTEM 

     To develop the proposed system, cryptographic symmetric 
encryption algorithm;  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
is  used  for  data  encryption.  To  create  image  steganography, 
Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  method  is  used  to  hide  the 
encrypted data into the cover image file. 

A. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
     AES  is  Advanced  Encryption  Standard,  a  United  States 
government standard algorithm for encryption and decryption 
data.  AES  is  a  symmetric  block  cipher  with  a  block  size  of 
128  bits.  This  means  that  it  uses  the  same  key  for  both 
encryption and decryption.  AES Key lengths can be 128 bits, 
192  bits,  or  256  bits;  called  AES-128,  AES-192  and  AES-
256, respectively. AES-128 uses 10 rounds, AES-192 uses 12 
rounds and AES-256 uses 14 rounds. The rounds operate on 
two  128-bit  inputs:  “State”  and  “Round  key”  [9].          These 
operate  on  a  4x4  arrays  of  bytes,  termed  the  state.  The 
proposed  system  used  128  bits  and  128  bits  key  size.  For 
complete  encryption,  the  data  is  passed  through  10  rounds. 
The algorithm begins with AddRoundKey stage followed by 
9 rounds of four stages and a tenth round of three stages. This 
applies  for  both  encryption  and  decryption  with 
the 
expansion that each stage of a round the decryption algorithm 
is  the  inverse  of  its  counterpart  in  the  encryption  algorithm. 
The four stages are as follows: 

B. Steganography 
     Steganography  is  the  art  of  hiding  information  and  an 
effort  to  conceal  the  existence  of  the  embedded  information 

  SubBytes() 
  ShiftRows() 
  MixColumns()

Image Steganography Based Audio Security System 

  AddRoundKey() 

Figure 4. The overall structure of the AES algorithm 

 

    The tenth round simply leaves out the Mix Columns stage. 
The first nine rounds of the decryption algorithm consist of 
the following: 

 
 
 
 

Inverse ShiftRows( ) 
Inverse SubBytes( ) 
Inverse AddRoundKey( ) 
Inverse MixColumns( ) 

     Again,  the  tenth  round  simply  leaves  out  the  Inverse 
MixColumns  stage  [10].  Each  of  these  stages  is  in  more 
detail  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  SubBytes(  )  adds  confusion  by 
processing  each  byte  through  an  S-Box.  An  S-Box  is  a 
substitution  table,  where  one  byte  is  substitution  algorithm. 
ShiftRows( ) provides diffusion by mixing data  within rows. 
Row zero of the State is not shifted, row 1 is 1 byte, row 2 is 
shifted 2 bytes and row 3 is  shifted 3 bytes.  MixColumns(  ) 
also provides diffusion by mixing data within columns. The 4 
bytes  of  each  column  in  the  State  are  treated  as  a  4-byte 
number and transformed to another 4-byte  number  via  finite 
field  mathematics.  AddRoundKey(  )  performs  the  actual 
‘encryption’, when each bytes in the State is XORed with the 
sub  key.  The  subkey  is  derived  from  the  key  according  to  a 
key expansion schedule. AES key Expansion( ) The AES key 
expansion algorithm takes input a 4-word (16-bytes) key and 
produces  a  linear  array  of  44  words,  providing  a  4-word 

round key for initial AddRoundKey stage and each of the 10 
rounds of the cipher [1].   

B. Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
      Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  insertion  is  a  common, 
simple approach to embedding information in a cover image. 
Image is composed of bits of RGB values.  R stands  for red, 
G stand for green and B stands for blue. After that, the least 
significant bit of  some or all  of the bytes inside an image is 
changed  to  a  bit  of  each  of  the  Red,  Green  and  Blue  color 
components  so  that  they  can  be  used,  since  they  are  each 
represented  by  a  byte.  In  other  words  one  can  store  3  bit  in 
each pixel. An 800*600 pixel image can store a total amount 
of  1,440,000  bits  or  180,000  bytes  of  embedded  data.  For 
example  a  grid  for  3  pixels  of  a  24  bit  image  can  be  as 
follows: 
      (00101101    00011100    11011100) 
      (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
      (11010010    10101101    01100011) 
 
     When  the  letter  A,  which  binary  representation  is 
01000001  and  is  embedded  into  the  least  significant  bits  of 
this part of the image, the resulting grid is as follows: 
     (00101100    00011101    11011100) 
     (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
     (11010010    10101101    01100011) 

     Although the letter was embedded into the first 8 bytes of 
the  grid,  only  the  two  highlighted  bits  need  to  be  changed 
according to the embedded message. On average only half of 
the bit in an image  will need to be modified to hide a secret 
message  using  the  maximum  cover  size.  The  proposed 
system is designed to embed  the data (encrypted audio) into 
an  image.  The  least  significant  bit  of  each  byte  of  image  is 
substituted by the binary bit of data and then the stego-image 
is produced [11].

     The  proposed  system  can  be  categorized  into  two 
portions: the sender’s view and the receiver’s view as shown 
in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The secret audio file is encrypted by 
AES  encryption  algorithm  with  the  help  of  secret  key  at  the 
sender’s side. Then the encrypted audio file is embedded into 
a  cover  image  by  LSB  algorithm  and  it  can  produce  the 
stego-image. 

location  for  the  encrypted  file.  Then  the  user  has  to  fill  the 
secret  key  to  encrypt  the  original  file  with  the  help  of  AES 
algorithm.  The  interface  for  encryption  process  is  shown  in 
Figure 8.  

Figure 8. Encryption interface. 

 

     The next phase is embedding phase. To do that, encrypted 
file  has to be embedded into a cover image. The user has to 
load  the  encrypted  file  and  open  the  cover  image.  The  user 
can embed the encrypted file into the cover file by using LSB 
algorithm. Then the stego-image is got and the user can save 
that image at the desired location. The embedding interface is 
shown in Figure 9.    

Figure 6. Block diagram from the receiver’s view.  

 

     The encrypted audio file is extracted from the stego-image 
by using LSB extraction algorithm at the receiver’s side. The 
extracted secret audio file is decrypted by the AES algorithm 
with the shared secret key and the original audio file is then 
produced. 
 

VI. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM 

     Implementation  results  are  described  in  this  section  and 
these  are  presented  as  a  series  of  interfaces.  The  ‘Home’ 
interface  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.  The  original  audio  file  is 
encrypted  first  at  the  sender’s  side,  which  is  illustrated  in 
Figure 8. In this stage, the user is needed to load the original 
audio file and needed to point the 

Figure 9. Embedding interface. 

 

     The  user  must  extract  the  encrypted  file  first  from  the 
stego-image at the receiver’s side. At the extraction interface, 
the  user  has  to  load  the  stego-image  and  has  to  choose  the 
location to save extracted file. Then, the user can extract the 
encrypted  file  from  the  stego-image  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
10. The user at the receiver’s side must decrypt the extracted 
file  as  illustrated  in  Figure  11.  The  user  has  to  load  the 
extracted  file  and  needs  to  type  the  correct  16  digits  secret 
key.

III. TWO WAYS OF INFORMATION SECURITY 

     In  this  work,  it  is  considered  at  two  concepts  for 
information  security  in  order  to  transmit  the  information 
secretly  over  open  networks.  These  points  are  cryptography 
and steganography.

requirements  are:  Confidentiality  means 

A. Cryptography 
     Cryptography is the art of achieving security by encoding 
message to make them non-readable and the science of using 
mathematics  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  data.  It  enables  to  store 
sensitive information or transmit it across insecure  networks 
(like the internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except 
the  intended  recipient  [4].  The  security  goals  to  meet  the 
security 
that 
unauthorized parties cannot access information.  Authenticity 
refers  to  validating  the  source  of  the  message  to  ensure  the 
sender  is  properly  identified.  Integrity  provides  assurance 
that  the  message  was  not  modified  during  transmission, 
accidentally  or  intentionally.  Non-repudiation  means  that  a 
sender  cannot  deny  sending  the  message  at  a  later  date,  and 
the  receiver  cannot  deny  receiving  it  [5].  In  cryptography, 
encryption algorithms can be categorized into symmetric key 
(private) and asymmetric (public) key [6]. 

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of symmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     With  symmetric  encryption,  confidentiality  is  guaranteed 
by the use of a secret  key as  shown in Figure 1. To achieve 
confidentiality, symmetric cryptographic algorithms are used. 

Figure2. Schematic diagram of asymmetric cryptosystem. 

 

     Public-key  cryptography  solves 
the  key-distribution 
problem by making a scheme that uses two keys, public key 
and  private  key,  rather  than  one  [7].  It  uses  a  pair  of  keys: 
one  that  encrypts  the  data  and  one  that  decrypts  the  data  as 
shown in Figure 2. It is also called public key cryptosystems. 
In  these  two  types  of  encryption  techniques,  symmetric 
cryptographic systems are popular for high speed encryption 
and  low  cipher  expansion  rate,  comparing  to  asymmetric 
cryptosystems.  The  proposed  system  uses  Advanced 
Encryption  Standard  (AES), 
the  symmetric  encryption 
algorithm. 

[8]. The term steganography is derived from the Greek word 
“stegano”  means  “covered”  and  “graphy”  means  “writing”. 
The  goal  of  steganography  is  to  hide  message  inside  other 
harmless message in a way that does not allow any enemy to 
even detect that there is a second secret message present [8]. 
It  includes  a  vast  array  of  secret  communications  methods 
that conceal the message’s existence. Most of steganography 
works have been carried out on image, video, audio and text 
as shown in Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3. Types of steganography. 

     Among those various carrier media, image steganography 
is  very  popular  to  hide  information  in  it.  In  this  proposed 
system, image steganography is used to hide secret audio file. 
LSB  (Least  Significant  Bit)  algorithm  is  used  in  this 
proposed system.  

IV.BACKGROUND THEORIES OF PROPOSED 

SYSTEM 

     To develop the proposed system, cryptographic symmetric 
encryption algorithm;  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
is  used  for  data  encryption.  To  create  image  steganography, 
Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  method  is  used  to  hide  the 
encrypted data into the cover image file. 

A. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
     AES  is  Advanced  Encryption  Standard,  a  United  States 
government standard algorithm for encryption and decryption 
data.  AES  is  a  symmetric  block  cipher  with  a  block  size  of 
128  bits.  This  means  that  it  uses  the  same  key  for  both 
encryption and decryption.  AES Key lengths can be 128 bits, 
192  bits,  or  256  bits;  called  AES-128,  AES-192  and  AES-
256, respectively. AES-128 uses 10 rounds, AES-192 uses 12 
rounds and AES-256 uses 14 rounds. The rounds operate on 
two  128-bit  inputs:  “State”  and  “Round  key”  [9].          These 
operate  on  a  4x4  arrays  of  bytes,  termed  the  state.  The 
proposed  system  used  128  bits  and  128  bits  key  size.  For 
complete  encryption,  the  data  is  passed  through  10  rounds. 
The algorithm begins with AddRoundKey stage followed by 
9 rounds of four stages and a tenth round of three stages. This 
applies  for  both  encryption  and  decryption  with 
the 
expansion that each stage of a round the decryption algorithm 
is  the  inverse  of  its  counterpart  in  the  encryption  algorithm. 
The four stages are as follows: 

B. Steganography 
     Steganography  is  the  art  of  hiding  information  and  an 
effort  to  conceal  the  existence  of  the  embedded  information

  ShiftRows() 
  MixColumns()

  AddRoundKey() 

Figure 4. The overall structure of the AES algorithm 

 

    The tenth round simply leaves out the Mix Columns stage. 
The first nine rounds of the decryption algorithm consist of 
the following: 

 
 
 
 

Inverse ShiftRows( ) 
Inverse SubBytes( ) 
Inverse AddRoundKey( ) 
Inverse MixColumns( ) 

     Again,  the  tenth  round  simply  leaves  out  the  Inverse 
MixColumns  stage  [10].  Each  of  these  stages  is  in  more 
detail  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  SubBytes(  )  adds  confusion  by 
processing  each  byte  through  an  S-Box.  An  S-Box  is  a 
substitution  table,  where  one  byte  is  substitution  algorithm. 
ShiftRows( ) provides diffusion by mixing data  within rows. 
Row zero of the State is not shifted, row 1 is 1 byte, row 2 is 
shifted 2 bytes and row 3 is  shifted 3 bytes.  MixColumns(  ) 
also provides diffusion by mixing data within columns. The 4 
bytes  of  each  column  in  the  State  are  treated  as  a  4-byte 
number and transformed to another 4-byte  number  via  finite 
field  mathematics.  AddRoundKey(  )  performs  the  actual 
‘encryption’, when each bytes in the State is XORed with the 
sub  key.  The  subkey  is  derived  from  the  key  according  to  a 
key expansion schedule. AES key Expansion( ) The AES key 
expansion algorithm takes input a 4-word (16-bytes) key and 
produces  a  linear  array  of  44  words,  providing  a  4-word 

round key for initial AddRoundKey stage and each of the 10 
rounds of the cipher [1].   

B. Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
      Least  Significant  Bit  (LSB)  insertion  is  a  common, 
simple approach to embedding information in a cover image. 
Image is composed of bits of RGB values.  R stands  for red, 
G stand for green and B stands for blue. After that, the least 
significant bit of  some or all  of the bytes inside an image is 
changed  to  a  bit  of  each  of  the  Red,  Green  and  Blue  color 
components  so  that  they  can  be  used,  since  they  are  each 
represented  by  a  byte.  In  other  words  one  can  store  3  bit  in 
each pixel. An 800*600 pixel image can store a total amount 
of  1,440,000  bits  or  180,000  bytes  of  embedded  data.  For 
example  a  grid  for  3  pixels  of  a  24  bit  image  can  be  as 
follows: 
      (00101101    00011100    11011100) 
      (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
      (11010010    10101101    01100011) 
 
     When  the  letter  A,  which  binary  representation  is 
01000001  and  is  embedded  into  the  least  significant  bits  of 
this part of the image, the resulting grid is as follows: 
     (00101100    00011101    11011100) 
     (10100110    11000100    00001100) 
     (11010010    10101101    01100011) 

     Although the letter was embedded into the first 8 bytes of 
the  grid,  only  the  two  highlighted  bits  need  to  be  changed 
according to the embedded message. On average only half of 
the bit in an image  will need to be modified to hide a secret 
message  using  the  maximum  cover  size.  The  proposed 
system is designed to embed  the data (encrypted audio) into 
an  image.  The  least  significant  bit  of  each  byte  of  image  is 
substituted by the binary bit of data and then the stego-image 
is produced [11].

     The  proposed  system  can  be  categorized  into  two 
portions: the sender’s view and the receiver’s view as shown 
in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The secret audio file is encrypted by 
AES  encryption  algorithm  with  the  help  of  secret  key  at  the 
sender’s side. Then the encrypted audio file is embedded into 
a  cover  image  by  LSB  algorithm  and  it  can  produce  the 
stego-image. 

location  for  the  encrypted  file.  Then  the  user  has  to  fill  the 
secret  key  to  encrypt  the  original  file  with  the  help  of  AES 
algorithm.  The  interface  for  encryption  process  is  shown  in 
Figure 8.  

Figure 8. Encryption interface. 

 

     The next phase is embedding phase. To do that, encrypted 
file  has to be embedded into a cover image. The user has to 
load  the  encrypted  file  and  open  the  cover  image.  The  user 
can embed the encrypted file into the cover file by using LSB 
algorithm. Then the stego-image is got and the user can save 
that image at the desired location. The embedding interface is 
shown in Figure 9.    

Figure 6. Block diagram from the receiver’s view.  

 

     The encrypted audio file is extracted from the stego-image 
by using LSB extraction algorithm at the receiver’s side. The 
extracted secret audio file is decrypted by the AES algorithm 
with the shared secret key and the original audio file is then 
produced. 
 

VI. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM 

     Implementation  results  are  described  in  this  section  and 
these  are  presented  as  a  series  of  interfaces.  The  ‘Home’ 
interface  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.  The  original  audio  file  is 
encrypted  first  at  the  sender’s  side,  which  is  illustrated  in 
Figure 8. In this stage, the user is needed to load the original 
audio file and needed to point the 

Figure 9. Embedding interface. 

 

     The  user  must  extract  the  encrypted  file  first  from  the 
stego-image at the receiver’s side. At the extraction interface, 
the  user  has  to  load  the  stego-image  and  has  to  choose  the 
location to save extracted file. Then, the user can extract the 
encrypted  file  from  the  stego-image  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
10. The user at the receiver’s side must decrypt the extracted 
file  as  illustrated  in  Figure  11.  The  user  has  to  load  the 
extracted  file  and  needs  to  type  the  correct  16  digits  secret 
key.

VII. CONCLUSION 

     The proposed system uses Advanced Encryption Standard 
(AES)  algorithm  for  cryptographic  portion  and  Least 
Significant  Bit  (LSB)  algorithm  for  steganographic  portion. 
Therefore,  the  proposed  system  can  support  two  layers  of 
security. But the weak point of this proposed system is that it 
can  be  allowed  for  small  size  of  audio  file  (only  .amr  file 
format) to embed into an image (.bmp). The proposed system 
can  be  modified  and  combined  with  other  cryptographic 
algorithms  and  steganographic  techniques  to  extend  more 
robust security system as further extension.
