Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515) 
• 
 MC1489 
• 
 MC1488 
• 
 Buffer (74LS244) 
•  Driver (ULN 2803)

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design:

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit.

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below.

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

      only authorized users can access a PC Anywhere host. 
• 
(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515) 
•

The control board consists of 15-bit bi-directional I/O port, it can connect 4 

devices to this board. The microcontroller has two ports (p1 and p3).  The p3 is an 8-bit 
bi-directional I/O port (p3.0  – p3.7), these ports are connected to 74LS244. P1 is an 8-
bit bi-directional I/O port (p1.0 –p1.7), this port is connected to the driver ULN2803. 

The microcontroller in this board represents the slave unit, which has three input 

signals (Manual switch, Sensors and RS-232) these signals have been analyzed by 
AT89C2051 then distributed over home appliances,  so that it is possible to turn devices 
on/off, as shown in Fig. (3).

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download

 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

The ability to connect external video and record image indoor or outdoor is done 

by using video capture card, then this image can transfer it through WLAN to the 
Laptop for monitoring and controlling the home remotely. 

The application for the user is written in Microsoft Visual C++, which utilize the 

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. Visual C++ provides several AppWizards. 
This Microsoft ’s Wizard technology allows us to create a project, including a project 
file, source code files, a resource script and a module definition file [7]. The AppWizard 
that was chosen for the project is the MFC AppWizard (exe). The reason for choosing 
this AppWizard is because, the Visual C++  ‘s built-in AppWizard produces predefined 
code and makes it easier to begin writing an applications. When an application is 
generated with AppWizard, it produces code that implements an application around the 
options that have been requested. 
6. Software design: 

 

The following software components have been designed and used: 

•  Assembly Language Program            

This language is used in programming microcontroller. The initialization and 

reset (Serial Port, Timers and Variables) was selected then microcontroller read inputs 
(Sensor, RF, Manual Switch and Serial Port). The order goes to the device to turn on or 
off. At the same time the microcontroller give handshake signals to the laptop to display 
the situation of the device. 
•  C++ Language 

This language is used to design the GUI in laptop which is show sensitivity and 

range of motion detector sensor.  
•  Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
     When the client executed the program, it will display a GUI shown in the Fig. (12).  

  

 

 

 

 

Fig.(12) The Client GUI Application 

 

The Client will have to click on the 

‘Connect to Motion Detector ’ button and 

send an inquiry for the motion detector Server. When the motion detector device is 
found, the Client GUI will receive the address of the motion detector. The address of the 
motion detector device will appear in the text box as shown in Fig.(12). The Client will 
then highlight the address and click on the 
‘ok’ button. This will allows the Client 
L2CAP to request a connection to the motion detector. If the request is successful, the 
RFCOMM will then create a wireless link between the two laptops. is shown in Fig. 
(13) and Fig.(14).

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download           

22 

 

 

 Mandatory password protection and login encryption help ensure that

     files across different platforms.  
• 
      only authorized users can access a PC Anywhere host. 
• 
(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515)

The control board consists of 15-bit bi-directional I/O port, it can connect 4 

devices to this board. The microcontroller has two ports (p1 and p3).  The p3 is an 8-bit 
bi-directional I/O port (p3.0  – p3.7), these ports are connected to 74LS244. P1 is an 8-
bit bi-directional I/O port (p1.0 –p1.7), this port is connected to the driver ULN2803. 

The microcontroller in this board represents the slave unit, which has three input 

signals (Manual switch, Sensors and RS-232) these signals have been analyzed by 
AT89C2051 then distributed over home appliances,  so that it is possible to turn devices

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

The ability to connect external video and record image indoor or outdoor is done 

by using video capture card, then this image can transfer it through WLAN to the 
Laptop for monitoring and controlling the home remotely. 

The application for the user is written in Microsoft Visual C++, which utilize the 

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. Visual C++ provides several AppWizards. 
This Microsoft ’s Wizard technology allows us to create a project, including a project 
file, source code files, a resource script and a module definition file [7]. The AppWizard 
that was chosen for the project is the MFC AppWizard (exe). The reason for choosing 
this AppWizard is because, the Visual C++  ‘s built-in AppWizard produces predefined 
code and makes it easier to begin writing an applications. When an application is 
generated with AppWizard, it produces code that implements an application around the 
options that have been requested. 
6. Software design: 

 

The following software components have been designed and used: 

•  Assembly Language Program            

This language is used in programming microcontroller. The initialization and 

reset (Serial Port, Timers and Variables) was selected then microcontroller read inputs 
(Sensor, RF, Manual Switch and Serial Port). The order goes to the device to turn on or 
off. At the same time the microcontroller give handshake signals to the laptop to display 
the situation of the device. 
•  C++ Language 

This language is used to design the GUI in laptop which is show sensitivity and 

range of motion detector sensor.  
•  Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
     When the client executed the program, it will display a GUI shown in the Fig. (12).  

  

 

 

 

 

Fig.(12) The Client GUI Application 

 

The Client will have to click on the 

‘Connect to Motion Detector ’ button and 

send an inquiry for the motion detector Server. When the motion detector device is 
found, the Client GUI will receive the address of the motion detector. The address of the 
motion detector device will appear in the text box as shown in Fig.(12). The Client will 
then highlight the address and click on the 
‘ok’ button. This will allows the Client 
L2CAP to request a connection to the motion detector. If the request is successful, the 
RFCOMM will then create a wireless link between the two laptops. is shown in Fig. 
(13) and Fig.(14).

Now that both the laptops (Client and Server) have been connected, the Client 

has and got the initial data from the connected motion detector device, the Client is 
ready to armed or disarm the motion detector. If the Client choose to the motion 
detector, the client just have to click on the

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download           

22

• 
(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515)

The control board consists of 15-bit bi-directional I/O port, it can connect 4 

devices to this board. The microcontroller has two ports (p1 and p3).  The p3 is an 8-bit 
bi-directional I/O port (p3.0  – p3.7), these ports are connected to 74LS244. P1 is an 8-
bit bi-directional I/O port (p1.0 –p1.7), this port is connected to the driver ULN2803. 

The microcontroller in this board represents the slave unit, which has three input 

signals (Manual switch, Sensors and RS-232) these signals have been analyzed by 
AT89C2051 then distributed over home appliances,  so that it is possible to turn devices 
on/off, as shown in Fig. (3).

comparator is used to convert the analogue signal (alarm sound) of smoke sensor to a 
digital signal to be as an input to the microcontroller. The second comparator is used to 
convert the analogue signal (alarm sound) of the motion detector sensor to the digital 
signal, to be as an input of microcontroller for process it. The schematic design of 
control board is illustrated in Fig.(4). Finally, Fig. (5) illustrates the layout of control

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

The ability to connect external video and record image indoor or outdoor is done 

by using video capture card, then this image can transfer it through WLAN to the 
Laptop for monitoring and controlling the home remotely. 

The application for the user is written in Microsoft Visual C++, which utilize the 

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. Visual C++ provides several AppWizards. 
This Microsoft ’s Wizard technology allows us to create a project, including a project 
file, source code files, a resource script and a module definition file [7]. The AppWizard 
that was chosen for the project is the MFC AppWizard (exe). The reason for choosing 
this AppWizard is because, the Visual C++  ‘s built-in AppWizard produces predefined 
code and makes it easier to begin writing an applications. When an application is 
generated with AppWizard, it produces code that implements an application around the 
options that have been requested. 
6. Software design: 

 

The following software components have been designed and used: 

•  Assembly Language Program            

This language is used in programming microcontroller. The initialization and 

reset (Serial Port, Timers and Variables) was selected then microcontroller read inputs 
(Sensor, RF, Manual Switch and Serial Port). The order goes to the device to turn on or 
off. At the same time the microcontroller give handshake signals to the laptop to display 
the situation of the device. 
•  C++ Language 

This language is used to design the GUI in laptop which is show sensitivity and 

range of motion detector sensor.  
•  Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
     When the client executed the program, it will display a GUI shown in the Fig. (12).  

  

 

 

 

 

Fig.(12) The Client GUI Application 

 

The Client will have to click on the 

‘Connect to Motion Detector ’ button and 

send an inquiry for the motion detector Server. When the motion detector device is 
found, the Client GUI will receive the address of the motion detector. The address of the 
motion detector device will appear in the text box as shown in Fig.(12). The Client will 
then highlight the address and click on the 
‘ok’ button. This will allows the Client 
L2CAP to request a connection to the motion detector. If the request is successful, the 
RFCOMM will then create a wireless link between the two laptops. is shown in Fig. 
(13) and Fig.(14).

Now that both the laptops (Client and Server) have been connected, the Client 

has and got the initial data from the connected motion detector device, the Client is 
ready to armed or disarm the motion detector. If the Client choose to the motion 
detector, the client just have to click on the 
Both the Server and the Client will get  response, which is shown in Fig. (15) and Fig. 
(16). The Client GUI will display a text box ‘configuring the Motion Detector’. 

‘Armed’ button and click the  ‘set’ button.

As for disarming the motion detector, the disarming response of both Client and 
Server is the same. When the Client want to disconnect from the motion detector, the 
Client just have to click on the ‘Disconnect from Motion Detector’ button. The display 

will show a textbox showing ‘closed’ as shown in the Fig.(17) and Fig.(18).

7. Conclusions: 
1- For more security and high band width the Bluetooth technology 802.15 seems to be 
suitable for the setup of a wireless instrument control network. Bluetooth key features 
are robustness to interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low 
power, where it operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download           

22 

 

 

 Mandatory password protection and login encryption help ensure that

      only authorized users can access a PC Anywhere host. 
• 
(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515)

The control board consists of 15-bit bi-directional I/O port, it can connect 4 

devices to this board. The microcontroller has two ports (p1 and p3).  The p3 is an 8-bit 
bi-directional I/O port (p3.0  – p3.7), these ports are connected to 74LS244. P1 is an 8-
bit bi-directional I/O port (p1.0 –p1.7), this port is connected to the driver ULN2803. 

The microcontroller in this board represents the slave unit, which has three input 

signals (Manual switch, Sensors and RS-232) these signals have been analyzed by 
AT89C2051 then distributed over home appliances,  so that it is possible to turn devices 
on/off, as shown in Fig. (3).

In this control board two comparator types (LM324 ) have been used, one 

comparator is used to convert the analogue signal (alarm sound) of smoke sensor to a 
digital signal to be as an input to the microcontroller. The second comparator is used to 
convert the analogue signal (alarm sound) of the motion detector sensor to the digital 
signal, to be as an input of microcontroller for process it. The schematic design of 
control board is illustrated in Fig.(4). Finally, Fig. (5) illustrates the layout of control

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this 
operation the second comparator inverts +12V to -12V ( OFF state).

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

The ability to connect external video and record image indoor or outdoor is done 

by using video capture card, then this image can transfer it through WLAN to the 
Laptop for monitoring and controlling the home remotely. 

The application for the user is written in Microsoft Visual C++, which utilize the 

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. Visual C++ provides several AppWizards. 
This Microsoft ’s Wizard technology allows us to create a project, including a project 
file, source code files, a resource script and a module definition file [7]. The AppWizard 
that was chosen for the project is the MFC AppWizard (exe). The reason for choosing 
this AppWizard is because, the Visual C++  ‘s built-in AppWizard produces predefined 
code and makes it easier to begin writing an applications. When an application is 
generated with AppWizard, it produces code that implements an application around the 
options that have been requested. 
6. Software design: 

 

The following software components have been designed and used: 

•  Assembly Language Program            

This language is used in programming microcontroller. The initialization and 

reset (Serial Port, Timers and Variables) was selected then microcontroller read inputs 
(Sensor, RF, Manual Switch and Serial Port). The order goes to the device to turn on or 
off. At the same time the microcontroller give handshake signals to the laptop to display 
the situation of the device. 
•  C++ Language 

This language is used to design the GUI in laptop which is show sensitivity and 

range of motion detector sensor.  
•  Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
     When the client executed the program, it will display a GUI shown in the Fig. (12).  

  

 

 

 

 

Fig.(12) The Client GUI Application 

 

The Client will have to click on the 

‘Connect to Motion Detector ’ button and 

send an inquiry for the motion detector Server. When the motion detector device is 
found, the Client GUI will receive the address of the motion detector. The address of the 
motion detector device will appear in the text box as shown in Fig.(12). The Client will 
then highlight the address and click on the 
‘ok’ button. This will allows the Client 
L2CAP to request a connection to the motion detector. If the request is successful, the 
RFCOMM will then create a wireless link between the two laptops. is shown in Fig. 
(13) and Fig.(14).

Now that both the laptops (Client and Server) have been connected, the Client 

has and got the initial data from the connected motion detector device, the Client is 
ready to armed or disarm the motion detector. If the Client choose to the motion 
detector, the client just have to click on the 
Both the Server and the Client will get  response, which is shown in Fig. (15) and Fig. 
(16). The Client GUI will display a text box ‘configuring the Motion Detector’. 

‘Armed’ button and click the  ‘set’ button.

As for disarming the motion detector, the disarming response of both Client and 
Server is the same. When the Client want to disconnect from the motion detector, the 
Client just have to click on the ‘Disconnect from Motion Detector’ button. The display 

will show a textbox showing ‘closed’ as shown in the Fig.(17) and Fig.(18).

7. Conclusions: 
1- For more security and high band width the Bluetooth technology 802.15 seems to be 
suitable for the setup of a wireless instrument control network. Bluetooth key features 
are robustness to interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low 
power, where it operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band   
2- A remote access surveillance system is a conjunction with GUI to make a remote 
control and video monitoring system. The PC Anywhere is powerful to remote access

the master laptop via Bluetooth technology, because it is more secure, confidence for 
controlling the devices and transfer video image. Also, the distance can be made more 
longer for transfer files and multimedia. In addition, this method needs one person to 
remote control and manage the communication between two computers.  
3- The system has been designed to be more flexible, by using Laptop as outdoor 
control or indoor control. But this outdoor control is more sensitive to environment 
between two Laptops, while indoor control is affected by number of walls inside the 
home.  
4- The system is considered a real time system and more reliable, through controlling 
and monitoring any place through using security sensors such as motion sensor with 
wireless surveillance camera and at the same time displays the status of outputs on 
laptop screen in real time.

1.  Introduction: 

      Detector Sensor. 

Home Security System is gaining its importance in many modern homes. With a 
personal computer available in many households today, home security system has found 
its practical application in Personal Area Network (PAN). PAN offers to users the 
advantage to personalize the network according to their needs instead of linking to 
public network. Fire alarm system is becoming essential in any home security system. 
Users are no longer satisfied with a simple fire alarm detector that just senses and 
sounds the alarm. Many would like to have a security system that monitors and alert 

19 

Bluetooth is currently arises as one of the most promising personal wireless 

network technologies. Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology standard intended 
to replace cables connecting mobile and fixed electronic devices, such as handhelds, 
mobile phones and laptops to external peripherals and with each other forming a 
Personal Area Network (PAN) [2]. Bluetooth key features are robustness to 
interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low power, where it 
operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band [3]. 

Bluetooth is a low power, short-range radio wireless technology. Recognizing 

the literal jungle of connectivity options as an impediment to the ability to allow 
different gadgets to interoperate was more likely one of the reasons for the development 
of Bluetooth. It is designed to support communications at distances to approximately 
100m for devices that operate using a limited amount of power. Its design for low 
power consumption makes the technology well suited for use with small, portable 
devices that typically are powered by battery. The Bluetooth technology has created a 
notion for Personal Area Network, a kind of close range wireless network that look set 
to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology around them. It 
allows PDAs (Personal Digital Assistance) to connect to cell phones and cell phones to 
connect to notebooks, the potential use of Bluetooth is only limited by ones 
imagination. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, even toaster, as well as home and office 
alarm systems, all eventually could be Bluetooth-compliant [4].  

The following are the Stack that contains the higher layers of the Bluetooth 

protocol stack and compliant with the Bluetooth specification: 
1. Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) 
2. Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) 
3. Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) 
4. Host Controller Interface (HCI) Driver The Bluetooth specification is made up of 
seven main Protocol Stacks. A brief description of each of their function is shown in 
Fig. 1 .

them in case of emergency especially when they are away. Many products in the market 
are expensive, complicated and require the system to be linked to a public emergency 
system. However, people are looking for a low cost and simpler solution. 

The aim of this research is to incorporate wireless technology into the motion, 

which uses the Bluetooth technology to enable a Laptop (User) to control the sensitivity 
and range of the detection area. 

Replacing of wired connections between electronic devices with wireless 
connections will revolutionize the way for organizing industrial, office and home 
environments [1].

Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4GHz. As this frequency is 

not reserved for Bluetooth, a frequency-hopping scheme with 79 sub-frequencies is 
used to combat interference and fading. The frequency-hopping scheme also enables 
Bluetooth to work not only in point-to-point connections but also in point to multi-point 
connections. 

Each Bluetooth device may be a Master or a Slave at any one time, though not 

simultaneously. Two or more units share the same channel forming a piconet, consisting 
of one master an up to seven slaves.      

Every Bluetooth device has a unique Bluetooth device address, and a Bluetooth 

clock. When Slaves connect to a Master, they are told of the Bluetooth address and  
clock of the Master. The Master controls when devices are allowed to transmit. 
3. Home Security System Design: 

 

 

 

Computer Monitoring and Security System Using… 
 

Basically, a home security system is to protect one property from intruders. We 
can categorize it in to two parts. They are the exterior sensors and the interior sensors. 
The sensors should perform one of the three functions: 
(1) Detection of an intruder approaching or penetrating a secured boundary, such as a 
door, wall, roof, floor, vent or window. 
(2) Detection of an intruder moving within a secured area, such as a room or hallway. 
(3) Detection of an intruder moving, lifting, or touching a particular object. 
The interior sensors are also susceptible to false and nuisance alarms, however not to 
the extent of their exterior counterparts. This is due to the more controlled nature. 

In order to fulfill the aim of this paper, it is necessary to derive the hardware 

architecture design based on the understanding of the Bluetooth technology. To begin, 
the basic design module of the hardware is shown in Fig. 2 below. 
       This section describes the design requirements : 
3.1. Power Requirements: 

A 9 V battery will be used for the motion detector with an estimated life of 9 
months to 1 year. Another consideration is that the product has to consume the least 
power possible to conserve and enhance the battery life. 
3.2. Processor Requirements: 

The product will use a low power ATMEL AT90S8515 CMOS 8- bit 

microcontroller. The AT90S8515 microcontroller achieves throughputs approaching 1 
MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus 
processing speed. 
Some of the features of the AT90S8515 are: 
   8k Bytes of In-System Programmable Flash 
   512 Bytes of SRAM and In-System Programmable EEPROM 
   Master/Slave SPI Serial Interface 
   Low-power, High-speed CMOS Process Technology 
   Power Consumption at 4MHZ, 3V 
- Active: 3.0 mA 
- Idle Mode: 1.0 mA 
- Power Down Mode: <1  (cid:242) A 
   32 Programmable I/O Lines 
Operating Voltages - 4.0 –6.0

3.3.Wireless Tuning Requirements: 

 

 

The wireless tuning of the motion detector will be done with the Bluetooth Stack 
residing on a laptop and communicates with the motion detector via the serial link (RS-
232 serial cable between the motion detector and the laptop). The setting is get from the 
remote laptop over the Bluetooth communication and then send over via the serial cable 
to the motion detector.  

The prototype Bluetooth communication link will be done by using two laptops 
with Bluetooth stack resides on the Laptop connected with the Ericsson ROK 101007 
Bluetooth module via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). The motion detector will be 
connected to one of the laptop via the serial link (Serial cable between the motion 
detector and the laptop) [5]. 

In this research PC Anywhere method has been used as remote access to the 

master desktop PC. PC Anywhere is a useful tool for accessing PC over a network, from 
a PC at a different locations. Typically, people use PC Anywhere to connect from their 
home computers to their office PCs.  PC Anywhere's built-in 256-bit encryption and 
enhanced video performance help make communications much more secure and fast.  
The PC Anywhere method has several  features [6]: 
•  Connection wizard guides new users through their initial client-host   
     connection.  
•  Powerful file-transfer capabilities allow users to upload and download           

22 

 

 

 Mandatory password protection and login encryption help ensure that

      only authorized users can access a PC Anywhere host. 
• 
(such as    Command Prompt, Task Manager, and    Services) on the host system.   
Single Session manager combines PC Anywhere manager.  
 3.4. Security Requirements: 

 Remote Management tools provide direct access to vital operating system utilities 

 

 

         

The sensor for the motion detector is the LHi-958 pyroelectric (PIR) sensor. It is 

an infrared detector for passive infrared intrusion alarms and motion detector.  

The pyroelectric materials produce a charge transfer when they undergo a 

change in thermal energy. This effect is applied for detectors that show an output signal 
similar to alternating current with a charge in the infrared radiation. The uses of these 
sensors are in movement detectors, passive infrared alarms and automatic light 
switches. 

The typical connection the PIR sensor consist of  the amplifier is a typical 

bandwidth limited to about 1Hz to reject high frequency noise. The comparator 
responds to both positive and negative transitions of the sensor output signal.    
3.5. PIR Motion Detector: 

 

The wireless communication of the Bluetooth motion detector will be done 

using the Ericsson ROK 101007 module with the laptops. The Ericsson ROK 101007 is 
a short-range module for implementing Bluetooth functionality into various devices. 
The module also supports all Bluetooth profiles. 

There will be a Graphic User Interface (GUI) implemented on the User Laptop 
and protocol written to let the user configure the motion detector sensitivity and range. 
While the motion detector will be connected to the other Laptop via the serial port using 
the RS-232 cable. The application running on the microprocessor (ATMEL) in the 
motion detector gets the data from the Serial Port and then changes the settings on the 
motion detector.  

The scope of this project is to produce a microcontroller controlled motion 

detector connected to a laptop via a serial cable, which enable a remote laptop to control 
the sensitivity and the range of the motion detector. This technique gives the 
homeowner more reliable, flexible and easy to use for monitoring the home indoor or 
outdoor by depending on transmit power type of Bluetooth device inside laptop. Let us 
discourse for a while and explain what is basic capability of a Home Security System 
motion detector.  
3.6. Hardware Design: 

            

    

The control Board consists of several components, the description of these 

components is the same as in control board1. These  elements are illustrated as follows: 
• 
 Microcontroller (AT90S8515)

The control board consists of 15-bit bi-directional I/O port, it can connect 4 

devices to this board. The microcontroller has two ports (p1 and p3).  The p3 is an 8-bit 
bi-directional I/O port (p3.0  – p3.7), these ports are connected to 74LS244. P1 is an 8-
bit bi-directional I/O port (p1.0 –p1.7), this port is connected to the driver ULN2803.

5. Motion Detector Sensor Interfacing:  

           

The motion detector is connected to microcontroller through comparator 

(LM324). The microcontroller receive the sensor signal then it sends to alarm device to 
be operated and at the same time sends the command to all devices at home to be shut 
down (OFF), in order to protect the home from any further attack.   The block diagram 
shown in Fig. (9) illustrates the interface motion detector sensor with microcontroller 
through buffer (74LS244). The method of this interface is similar to the interface 
between smoke sensor and microcontroller, which used comparator (LM324) between 
sensor and buffer. The function of this comparator is to convert the analog signal (alarm 
sound of sensor) to digital signal (logic1 or logic0), logic1 represents +5V while logic0 
represents 0V. When sensor alarm is operating (ON) the -12V appears on output of the 
first comparator, the second comparator acts as inverting the (-12V) to (+12V), then this 
digital signal input to buffer then to microcontroller to process it. When alarm of sensor 
is not operating (OFF), the +12V appears on output of first comparator.  After this

An Ad-Hoc mode wireless network connects two computers directly without the 
use of a router or Access Point (AP), in order to monitoring and controlling the situation 
of the home devices, Fig. (10) illustrates this connection.

Surveillance cameras increase security as they allow for monitoring of an area in 

order to alert home owner. Installing cameras in a home setting can be difficult, 
expensive and time consuming because of the long wires that are required. Thus, a 
wireless solution is needed to remedy this problem. The interface to the master desktop 
PC will allow a user to view images that are captured from the camera and sent via RF 
which operates in the globally available 900 MHz frequency range. The wireless camera 
system consists of wireless camera which is connected to the power supply 12V and 
wireless receiver that converts the capturing image from camera to the A/V. This 
receiver is connected to video capture card  via power line.  

The video capture card with remote control shown in Fig. (11), is used to 

connect the wireless camera receiver with master desktop PC, this capture card 
interfaces with master desktop PC via PCI slot. The capture card function is used to 
convert the analog signal of wireless camera to digital signal of master  desktop PC.

The ability to connect external video and record image indoor or outdoor is done 

by using video capture card, then this image can transfer it through WLAN to the 
Laptop for monitoring and controlling the home remotely. 

The application for the user is written in Microsoft Visual C++, which utilize the 

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. Visual C++ provides several AppWizards. 
This Microsoft ’s Wizard technology allows us to create a project, including a project 
file, source code files, a resource script and a module definition file [7]. The AppWizard 
that was chosen for the project is the MFC AppWizard (exe). The reason for choosing 
this AppWizard is because, the Visual C++  ‘s built-in AppWizard produces predefined 
code and makes it easier to begin writing an applications. When an application is 
generated with AppWizard, it produces code that implements an application around the 
options that have been requested. 
6. Software design: 

 

The following software components have been designed and used: 

•  Assembly Language Program            

This language is used in programming microcontroller. The initialization and 

reset (Serial Port, Timers and Variables) was selected then microcontroller read inputs 
(Sensor, RF, Manual Switch and Serial Port). The order goes to the device to turn on or 
off. At the same time the microcontroller give handshake signals to the laptop to display 
the situation of the device. 
•  C++ Language 

This language is used to design the GUI in laptop which is show sensitivity and 

range of motion detector sensor.  
•  Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
     When the client executed the program, it will display a GUI shown in the Fig. (12).  

  

 

 

 

 

Fig.(12) The Client GUI Application 

 

The Client will have to click on the 

‘Connect to Motion Detector ’ button and 

send an inquiry for the motion detector Server. When the motion detector device is 
found, the Client GUI will receive the address of the motion detector. The address of the 
motion detector device will appear in the text box as shown in Fig.(12). The Client will 
then highlight the address and click on the 
‘ok’ button. This will allows the Client 
L2CAP to request a connection to the motion detector. If the request is successful, the 
RFCOMM will then create a wireless link between the two laptops. is shown in Fig. 
(13) and Fig.(14).

Now that both the laptops (Client and Server) have been connected, the Client 

has and got the initial data from the connected motion detector device, the Client is 
ready to armed or disarm the motion detector. If the Client choose to the motion 
detector, the client just have to click on the 
Both the Server and the Client will get  response, which is shown in Fig. (15) and Fig. 
(16). The Client GUI will display a text box ‘configuring the Motion Detector’. 

‘Armed’ button and click the  ‘set’ button.

As for disarming the motion detector, the disarming response of both Client and 
Server is the same. When the Client want to disconnect from the motion detector, the 
Client just have to click on the ‘Disconnect from Motion Detector’ button. The display 

will show a textbox showing ‘closed’ as shown in the Fig.(17) and Fig.(18).

After the Client click on the ‘ok’ button of the textbox, the Client GUI status bar 

will display that the motion detector has been disconnected as shown in Fig. ( 19).

7. Conclusions: 
1- For more security and high band width the Bluetooth technology 802.15 seems to be 
suitable for the setup of a wireless instrument control network. Bluetooth key features 
are robustness to interference, low complexity, low cost, inherent security and low 
power, where it operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency ISM band   
2- A remote access surveillance system is a conjunction with GUI to make a remote 
control and video monitoring system. The PC Anywhere is powerful to remote access

the master laptop via Bluetooth technology, because it is more secure, confidence for 
controlling the devices and transfer video image. Also, the distance can be made more 
longer for transfer files and multimedia. In addition, this method needs one person to 
remote control and manage the communication between two computers.  
3- The system has been designed to be more flexible, by using Laptop as outdoor 
control or indoor control. But this outdoor control is more sensitive to environment 
between two Laptops, while indoor control is affected by number of walls inside the 
home.  
4- The system is considered a real time system and more reliable, through controlling 
and monitoring any place through using security sensors such as motion sensor with 
wireless surveillance camera and at the same time displays the status of outputs on 
laptop screen in real time.
