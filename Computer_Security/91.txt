Abstract 

 
Wireless  networking  provides  many  advantages,  but  it  also  coupled  with  new  security 
threats  and  alters  the  organization’s  overall  information  security  risk  profile.  Although 
implementation  of  technological  solutions  is  the  usual  respond  to  wireless  security  threats 
and vulnerabilities, wireless security is primarily a management issue. Effective management 
of the threats associated with wireless technology requires a sound and thorough assessment 
of risk given the environment and development  of a plan to mitigate identified threats. We 
present a framework to help managers understand and assess the various threats associated 
with  the  use  of  wireless  technology.  We  also  discuss  a  number  of  available  solutions  for 
countering those threats.

information 

Wireless  networking  presents  many  advantages  Productivity  improves  because  of 
resources.  Network  configuration  and 
increased  accessibility 
reconfiguration is easier, faster, and less expensive. However, wireless technology also 
creates  new  threats  and  alters  the  existing  information  security  risk  profile.  For 
example, because communications takes place "through the air" using radio frequencies, 
the  risk  of  interception  is  greater  than  with  wired  networks.  If  the  message  is  not 
encrypted,  or  encrypted  with  a  weak  algorithm,  the  attacker  can  read  it,  thereby 
compromising confidentiality. Although wireless networking alters the risks associated 
with various threats to security, the overall security objectives remain the same as with 
wired  networks:  preserving  confidentiality,  ensuring 
integrity,  and  maintaining 
availability of the information and information systems. The objective of this paper is 
to  assist  managers  in  making  such  decisions  by  providing  them  with  a  basic 
understanding of the nature of the various threats associated with wireless networking 
and available countermeasures.  

The  popularity  of  wireless  Networks  is  a  testament  primarily  to  their  convenience,  cost 
efficiency,  and  ease  of  integration  with  other  networks  and  network  components.  The 
majority of computers sold to consumers today come pre-equipped with all necessary wireless 
Networks  technology.  The  benefits  of  wireless  Networks  include:  Convenience,  Mobility, 
Productivity, Deployment, Expandability and Cost.

2.1.2 Malicious association 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

“Malicious associations” are when wireless devices can be actively made by crackers 
to  connect  to  a  company  network  through  their  cracking  laptop  instead  of  a  company 
access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when 
a  cracker  runs  some  software  that  makes  his/her  wireless  network  card  look  like  a 
legitimate access point. Once the cracker has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, 
launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate 
at  the  Layer  2  level,  Layer  3  protections  such  as  network  authentication  and  virtual 
private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with 
protection but are still vulnerable to cracking. The idea behind this type of attack may 
not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the cracker is just 
trying to take over the client at the Layer 2 level. 

 

2.1.3 Ad-hoc networks 

Ad-hoc networks can pose a security threat. Ad-hoc networks are defined as peer-to-
peer networks between wireless computers that do not have an access point in between 
them. While these types of networks usually have little protection, encryption methods 
can be used to provide security. 

 

2.1.4 Non-traditional networks 

Non-traditional  networks  such  as  personal  network  Bluetooth  devices  are  not  safe 
from  cracking  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  Even  barcode  readers, 
handheld  PDAs,  and  wireless  printers  and  copiers  should  be  secured.  These  non-
traditional  networks  can  be  easily  overlooked  by  IT  personnel  who  have  narrowly 
focused on laptops and access points. 

 

2.1.5 Identity theft (MAC spoofing) 

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on 
network  traffic  and  identify  the  MAC  address  of  a  computer  with  network  privileges. 
Most  wireless  systems  allow  some  kind  of  MAC  filtering  to  only  allow  authorized 
computers  with  specific  MAC  IDs  to  gain  access  and  utilize  the  network.  However,  a 
number  of  programs  exist  that  have  network  “sniffing”  capabilities.  Combine  these 
programs with other software that allow a computer to pretend it has any MAC address 
that the cracker desires, and the cracker can easily get around that hurdle. 

 

2.1.6 Man-in-the-middle attacks 

A man-in-the-middle attacker entices computers to log into a computer which is set 
up as a soft AP (Access Point). Once this is done, the hacker connects to a real access 
point  through  another  wireless  card  offering  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  through  the 
transparent hacking computer to the real network. The hacker can then sniff the traffic. 
One  type  of  man-in-the-middle  attack  relies  on  security  faults  in  challenge  and 
handshake  protocols  to  execute  a  “de-authentication  attack”.  This  attack  forces  AP-

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on

79 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 
connected computers to drop their connections and reconnect with the cracker’s soft AP. 
Man-in-the-middle  attacks  are  enhanced  by  software  such  as  LANjack  and  AirJack, 
which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes. 

 

3. Securing Wireless Transmissions  

The  nature  of  wireless  communications  creates  three  basic  threats:  Interception, 

Alteration and Disruption.  

3.1 Protecting the Confidentiality of Wireless Transmissions  

Two  types  of  countermeasures  exist  for  reducing  the  risk  of  eavesdropping  on 
wireless transmissions. The first involves methods for making it more difficult to locate 
and intercept the wireless signals. The second involves the use of encryption to preserve 
confidentiality even if the wireless signal is intercepted.  

 

3.1.1  Signal-Hiding Techniques In order to intercept wireless transmissions, attackers first 
need  to  identify  and  locate  wireless  networks.  There  are,  however,  a  number  of  steps  that

1. Introduction  

to 

information 

Wireless  networking  presents  many  advantages  Productivity  improves  because  of 
resources.  Network  configuration  and 
increased  accessibility 
reconfiguration is easier, faster, and less expensive. However, wireless technology also 
creates  new  threats  and  alters  the  existing  information  security  risk  profile.  For 
example, because communications takes place "through the air" using radio frequencies, 
the  risk  of  interception  is  greater  than  with  wired  networks.  If  the  message  is  not 
encrypted,  or  encrypted  with  a  weak  algorithm,  the  attacker  can  read  it,  thereby 
compromising confidentiality. Although wireless networking alters the risks associated 
with various threats to security, the overall security objectives remain the same as with 
wired  networks:  preserving  confidentiality,  ensuring 
integrity,  and  maintaining 
availability of the information and information systems. The objective of this paper is 
to  assist  managers  in  making  such  decisions  by  providing  them  with  a  basic 
understanding of the nature of the various threats associated with wireless networking 
and available countermeasures.  

The  popularity  of  wireless  Networks  is  a  testament  primarily  to  their  convenience,  cost 
efficiency,  and  ease  of  integration  with  other  networks  and  network  components.  The 
majority of computers sold to consumers today come pre-equipped with all necessary wireless 
Networks  technology.  The  benefits  of  wireless  Networks  include:  Convenience,  Mobility, 
Productivity, Deployment, Expandability and Cost.

Wireless  Network  technology,  while  replete  with  the  conveniences  and  advantages 
described  above  has  its  share  of  downfalls.  For  a  given  networking  situation,  wireless 
Networks may not be desirable for a number of reasons. Most of these have to do with the 
inherent  limitations  of  the  technology.  The  disadvantages  of  using  a  wireless  network  are: 
Security, Range, Reliability, and Speed.  

 
Wireless  Networks  present  a  host  of  issues  for  network  managers.  Unauthorized  access 
points, broadcasted SSIDs, unknown stations, and spoofed MAC addresses are just a few of 
the problems addressed in WLAN troubleshooting. Most network analysis vendors, such as 
Network  Instruments,  Network  General,  and  Fluke,  offer  WLAN  troubleshooting  tools  or 
functionalities as part of their product line. 

 

2. Wireless Vulnerabilities, Threats and Countermeasures  

The  wireless  networks  consist  of  four  basic  components:  The  transmission  of  data 
using  radio frequencies;  Access  points  that  provide  a  connection  to  the  organizational 
network  and/or  the  Client  devices  (laptops,  PDAs,  etc.);  and  Users.  Each  of  these 
components provides an avenue for attack that can result in the compromise of one or 
more  of  the  three  fundamental  security  objectives  of  confidentiality,  integrity,  and 
availability.

2.1 Wireless Network Attacks 
 
2.1.1 Accidental association 

Unauthorized  access  to  company  wireless  and  wired  networks  can  come  from  a 
number  of  different  methods  and  intents.  One  of  these  methods  is  referred  to  as 
“accidental  association”.  When  a  user  turns  on  a  computer  and  it  latches  on  to  a 
wireless access point from a neighboring company’s overlapping network, the user may 
not  even  know  that  this  has  occurred.  However,  it  is  a  security  breach  in  that 
proprietary company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one 
company  to  the  other.  This  is  especially  true  if  the  laptop  is  also  hooked  to  a  wired 
network.

2.1.2 Malicious association 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

“Malicious associations” are when wireless devices can be actively made by crackers 
to  connect  to  a  company  network  through  their  cracking  laptop  instead  of  a  company 
access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when 
a  cracker  runs  some  software  that  makes  his/her  wireless  network  card  look  like  a 
legitimate access point. Once the cracker has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, 
launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate 
at  the  Layer  2  level,  Layer  3  protections  such  as  network  authentication  and  virtual 
private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with 
protection but are still vulnerable to cracking. The idea behind this type of attack may 
not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the cracker is just 
trying to take over the client at the Layer 2 level. 

 

2.1.3 Ad-hoc networks 

Ad-hoc networks can pose a security threat. Ad-hoc networks are defined as peer-to-
peer networks between wireless computers that do not have an access point in between 
them. While these types of networks usually have little protection, encryption methods 
can be used to provide security. 

 

2.1.4 Non-traditional networks 

Non-traditional  networks  such  as  personal  network  Bluetooth  devices  are  not  safe 
from  cracking  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  Even  barcode  readers, 
handheld  PDAs,  and  wireless  printers  and  copiers  should  be  secured.  These  non-
traditional  networks  can  be  easily  overlooked  by  IT  personnel  who  have  narrowly 
focused on laptops and access points. 

 

2.1.5 Identity theft (MAC spoofing) 

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on 
network  traffic  and  identify  the  MAC  address  of  a  computer  with  network  privileges. 
Most  wireless  systems  allow  some  kind  of  MAC  filtering  to  only  allow  authorized 
computers  with  specific  MAC  IDs  to  gain  access  and  utilize  the  network.  However,  a 
number  of  programs  exist  that  have  network  “sniffing”  capabilities.  Combine  these 
programs with other software that allow a computer to pretend it has any MAC address 
that the cracker desires, and the cracker can easily get around that hurdle. 

 

2.1.6 Man-in-the-middle attacks 

A man-in-the-middle attacker entices computers to log into a computer which is set 
up as a soft AP (Access Point). Once this is done, the hacker connects to a real access 
point  through  another  wireless  card  offering  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  through  the 
transparent hacking computer to the real network. The hacker can then sniff the traffic. 
One  type  of  man-in-the-middle  attack  relies  on  security  faults  in  challenge  and 
handshake  protocols  to  execute  a  “de-authentication  attack”.  This  attack  forces  AP-

79 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 
connected computers to drop their connections and reconnect with the cracker’s soft AP. 
Man-in-the-middle  attacks  are  enhanced  by  software  such  as  LANjack  and  AirJack, 
which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes. 

 

3. Securing Wireless Transmissions  

The  nature  of  wireless  communications  creates  three  basic  threats:  Interception, 

Alteration and Disruption.  

3.1 Protecting the Confidentiality of Wireless Transmissions  

Two  types  of  countermeasures  exist  for  reducing  the  risk  of  eavesdropping  on 
wireless transmissions. The first involves methods for making it more difficult to locate 
and intercept the wireless signals. The second involves the use of encryption to preserve 
confidentiality even if the wireless signal is intercepted.  

 

3.1.1  Signal-Hiding Techniques In order to intercept wireless transmissions, attackers first 
need  to  identify  and  locate  wireless  networks.  There  are,  however,  a  number  of  steps  that 

80 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
organizations  can  take  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  locate  their  wireless  access  points.  The 
easiest  and  least  costly  include  the  following:  Turning  offthe  service  set  identifier  (SSID) 
broadcasting  by  wireless  access  points,  Assign  cryptic  names  to  SSIDs,  Reducing  signal 
strength to the lowest level that still provides requisite coverage or Locating wireless access 
points in the interior of the building, away from windows and exterior walls. More effective, 
but  also  more  costly  methods  for  reducing  or  hiding  signals  include:  Using  directional 
antennas to constrain signal emanations within desired areas of coverage or Using of signal 
emanation-shielding techniques, sometimes referred to as TEMPEST, 1 to block emanation of 
wireless signals.  

 

3.1.2  Encryption  The  best  method  for  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  information 
transmitted  over  wireless  networks  is  to  encrypt  all  wireless  traffic.  This  is  especially 
important for organizations subject to regulations.  

 

3.2 Preventing Alteration of Intercepted Communications  

Interception  and  alteration  of  wireless  transmissions  represents  a  form  of  "man-in-
themiddle"  attack.  Two  types  of  countermeasures  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of 
such attacks: strong encryption and strong authentication of both devices and users.  

 

3.3 Countermeasures to Reduce the Risk of Denial-of-Service Attacks  

Wireless  communications  are  also  vulnerable  to  denial-of-service  (DoS)  attacks. 
Organizations  can  take  several  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  of  such  unintentional  DoS 
attacks.  Careful  site  surveys  can  identify  locations  where  signals  from  other  devices 
exist; the results of such surveys should be used when deciding where to locate wireless 
access points. Regular periodic audits of wireless networking activity and performance 
can  identify  problem  areas;  appropriate  remedial  actions  may  include  removal  of  the 
offending  devices  or  measures  to  increase  signal  strength  and  coverage  within  the 
problem area.  

 

4. Securing Wireless Access Points  
 

Insecure, poorly configured wireless access points can compromise confidentiality by 

allowing unauthorized access to the network.  

4.1 Countermeasures to Secure Wireless Access Points  

Organizations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  wireless  networks  by 

taking these three steps:  

1. Eliminating rogue access points;  
2. Properly configuring all authorized access points; and  
3. Using 802.1x to authenticate all devices.

Abstract 

 
Wireless  networking  provides  many  advantages,  but  it  also  coupled  with  new  security 
threats  and  alters  the  organization’s  overall  information  security  risk  profile.  Although 
implementation  of  technological  solutions  is  the  usual  respond  to  wireless  security  threats 
and vulnerabilities, wireless security is primarily a management issue. Effective management 
of the threats associated with wireless technology requires a sound and thorough assessment 
of risk given the environment and development  of a plan to mitigate identified threats. We 
present a framework to help managers understand and assess the various threats associated 
with  the  use  of  wireless  technology.  We  also  discuss  a  number  of  available  solutions  for 
countering those threats.

Insecure, poorly configured wireless access points can compromise confidentiality by 

allowing unauthorized access to the network.  

4.1 Countermeasures to Secure Wireless Access Points  

Organizations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  wireless  networks  by 

taking these three steps:  

1. Eliminating rogue access points;  
2. Properly configuring all authorized access points; and  
3. Using 802.1x to authenticate all devices.  

81 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

 

4.1.1 Eliminate Rogue Access Points  
 
The best method for dealing with the threat of rogue access points is to use 802.1x on the 
wired network to authenticate all devices that are plugged into the network. Using 802.1x will 
prevent any unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.  

 

4.1.2 Secure Configuration of Authorized Access Points  
 
Organizations  also  need  to  ensure  that  all  authorized  wireless  access  points  are  securely 
configured.  It  is  especially  important  to  change  all  default  settings  because  they  are 
wellknown and can be exploited by attackers.  

 
 

4.1.3 Use 802.1x to Authenticate all Devices  
 
Strong authentication of all devices attempting to connect to the network can prevent rogue 
access points and other unauthorized devices from becoming insecure backdoors. The 802.1x 
protocol  discussed  earlier  provides  a  means  for  strongly  authenticating  devices  prior  to 
assigning them IP addresses.  

 
 

5. Securing Wireless Client Devices  

Two  major  threats  to  wireless  client  devices  are  (1)  loss  or  theft,  and  (2) 
compromise. Loss or theft of laptops and PDAs is a serious problem. laptops and PDAs 
often store confidential and proprietary information. Consequently, loss or theft of the 
devices may cause the organization to be in violation of privacy regulations involving 
the  disclosure  of  personal  identifying  information  it  has  collected  from  third  parties. 
Another  threat  to  wireless  client  devices  is  that  they  can  be  compromised  so  that  an 
attacker  can  access  sensitive  information  stored  on  the  device  or  use  it  to  obtain 
unauthorized access to other system resources.  
 
 
6. Securing Wireless Networks 
 
6.1 Use of Encryption 
 

The most effective way to secure your wireless network from intruders is to encrypt, or 
scramble, communications over the network. Most wireless routers, access points, and base 
stations have a built-in encryption mechanism. If your wireless router doesn’t have an 
encryption feature, consider getting one that does. Manufacturers often deliver wireless 
routers with the encryption feature turned off. You must turn it on.

Abstract 

 
Wireless  networking  provides  many  advantages,  but  it  also  coupled  with  new  security 
threats  and  alters  the  organization’s  overall  information  security  risk  profile.  Although 
implementation  of  technological  solutions  is  the  usual  respond  to  wireless  security  threats 
and vulnerabilities, wireless security is primarily a management issue. Effective management 
of the threats associated with wireless technology requires a sound and thorough assessment 
of risk given the environment and development  of a plan to mitigate identified threats. We 
present a framework to help managers understand and assess the various threats associated 
with  the  use  of  wireless  technology.  We  also  discuss  a  number  of  available  solutions  for 
countering those threats.

1. Introduction  

to 

information 

Wireless  networking  presents  many  advantages  Productivity  improves  because  of 
resources.  Network  configuration  and 
increased  accessibility 
reconfiguration is easier, faster, and less expensive. However, wireless technology also 
creates  new  threats  and  alters  the  existing  information  security  risk  profile.  For 
example, because communications takes place "through the air" using radio frequencies, 
the  risk  of  interception  is  greater  than  with  wired  networks.  If  the  message  is  not 
encrypted,  or  encrypted  with  a  weak  algorithm,  the  attacker  can  read  it,  thereby 
compromising confidentiality. Although wireless networking alters the risks associated 
with various threats to security, the overall security objectives remain the same as with 
wired  networks:  preserving  confidentiality,  ensuring 
integrity,  and  maintaining 
availability of the information and information systems. The objective of this paper is 
to  assist  managers  in  making  such  decisions  by  providing  them  with  a  basic 
understanding of the nature of the various threats associated with wireless networking 
and available countermeasures.  

The  popularity  of  wireless  Networks  is  a  testament  primarily  to  their  convenience,  cost 
efficiency,  and  ease  of  integration  with  other  networks  and  network  components.  The 
majority of computers sold to consumers today come pre-equipped with all necessary wireless 
Networks  technology.  The  benefits  of  wireless  Networks  include:  Convenience,  Mobility, 
Productivity, Deployment, Expandability and Cost.

Wireless  Network  technology,  while  replete  with  the  conveniences  and  advantages 
described  above  has  its  share  of  downfalls.  For  a  given  networking  situation,  wireless 
Networks may not be desirable for a number of reasons. Most of these have to do with the 
inherent  limitations  of  the  technology.  The  disadvantages  of  using  a  wireless  network  are: 
Security, Range, Reliability, and Speed.  

 
Wireless  Networks  present  a  host  of  issues  for  network  managers.  Unauthorized  access 
points, broadcasted SSIDs, unknown stations, and spoofed MAC addresses are just a few of 
the problems addressed in WLAN troubleshooting. Most network analysis vendors, such as 
Network  Instruments,  Network  General,  and  Fluke,  offer  WLAN  troubleshooting  tools  or 
functionalities as part of their product line. 

 

2. Wireless Vulnerabilities, Threats and Countermeasures  

The  wireless  networks  consist  of  four  basic  components:  The  transmission  of  data 
using  radio frequencies;  Access  points  that  provide  a  connection  to  the  organizational 
network  and/or  the  Client  devices  (laptops,  PDAs,  etc.);  and  Users.  Each  of  these 
components provides an avenue for attack that can result in the compromise of one or 
more  of  the  three  fundamental  security  objectives  of  confidentiality,  integrity,  and 
availability.

2.1 Wireless Network Attacks 
 
2.1.1 Accidental association 

Unauthorized  access  to  company  wireless  and  wired  networks  can  come  from  a 
number  of  different  methods  and  intents.  One  of  these  methods  is  referred  to  as 
“accidental  association”.  When  a  user  turns  on  a  computer  and  it  latches  on  to  a 
wireless access point from a neighboring company’s overlapping network, the user may 
not  even  know  that  this  has  occurred.  However,  it  is  a  security  breach  in  that 
proprietary company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one 
company  to  the  other.  This  is  especially  true  if  the  laptop  is  also  hooked  to  a  wired 
network. 
 
 

78 

 
2.1.2 Malicious association 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

“Malicious associations” are when wireless devices can be actively made by crackers 
to  connect  to  a  company  network  through  their  cracking  laptop  instead  of  a  company 
access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when 
a  cracker  runs  some  software  that  makes  his/her  wireless  network  card  look  like  a 
legitimate access point. Once the cracker has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, 
launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate 
at  the  Layer  2  level,  Layer  3  protections  such  as  network  authentication  and  virtual 
private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with 
protection but are still vulnerable to cracking. The idea behind this type of attack may 
not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the cracker is just 
trying to take over the client at the Layer 2 level. 

 

2.1.3 Ad-hoc networks 

Ad-hoc networks can pose a security threat. Ad-hoc networks are defined as peer-to-
peer networks between wireless computers that do not have an access point in between 
them. While these types of networks usually have little protection, encryption methods 
can be used to provide security. 

 

2.1.4 Non-traditional networks 

Non-traditional  networks  such  as  personal  network  Bluetooth  devices  are  not  safe 
from  cracking  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  Even  barcode  readers, 
handheld  PDAs,  and  wireless  printers  and  copiers  should  be  secured.  These  non-
traditional  networks  can  be  easily  overlooked  by  IT  personnel  who  have  narrowly 
focused on laptops and access points. 

 

2.1.5 Identity theft (MAC spoofing) 

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on 
network  traffic  and  identify  the  MAC  address  of  a  computer  with  network  privileges. 
Most  wireless  systems  allow  some  kind  of  MAC  filtering  to  only  allow  authorized 
computers  with  specific  MAC  IDs  to  gain  access  and  utilize  the  network.  However,  a 
number  of  programs  exist  that  have  network  “sniffing”  capabilities.  Combine  these 
programs with other software that allow a computer to pretend it has any MAC address 
that the cracker desires, and the cracker can easily get around that hurdle. 

 

2.1.6 Man-in-the-middle attacks 

A man-in-the-middle attacker entices computers to log into a computer which is set 
up as a soft AP (Access Point). Once this is done, the hacker connects to a real access 
point  through  another  wireless  card  offering  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  through  the 
transparent hacking computer to the real network. The hacker can then sniff the traffic. 
One  type  of  man-in-the-middle  attack  relies  on  security  faults  in  challenge  and 
handshake  protocols  to  execute  a  “de-authentication  attack”.  This  attack  forces  AP-

79 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 
connected computers to drop their connections and reconnect with the cracker’s soft AP. 
Man-in-the-middle  attacks  are  enhanced  by  software  such  as  LANjack  and  AirJack, 
which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes. 

 

3. Securing Wireless Transmissions  

The  nature  of  wireless  communications  creates  three  basic  threats:  Interception, 

Alteration and Disruption.  

3.1 Protecting the Confidentiality of Wireless Transmissions  

Two  types  of  countermeasures  exist  for  reducing  the  risk  of  eavesdropping  on 
wireless transmissions. The first involves methods for making it more difficult to locate 
and intercept the wireless signals. The second involves the use of encryption to preserve 
confidentiality even if the wireless signal is intercepted.  

 

3.1.1  Signal-Hiding Techniques In order to intercept wireless transmissions, attackers first 
need  to  identify  and  locate  wireless  networks.  There  are,  however,  a  number  of  steps  that 

80 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
organizations  can  take  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  locate  their  wireless  access  points.  The 
easiest  and  least  costly  include  the  following:  Turning  offthe  service  set  identifier  (SSID) 
broadcasting  by  wireless  access  points,  Assign  cryptic  names  to  SSIDs,  Reducing  signal 
strength to the lowest level that still provides requisite coverage or Locating wireless access 
points in the interior of the building, away from windows and exterior walls. More effective, 
but  also  more  costly  methods  for  reducing  or  hiding  signals  include:  Using  directional 
antennas to constrain signal emanations within desired areas of coverage or Using of signal 
emanation-shielding techniques, sometimes referred to as TEMPEST, 1 to block emanation of 
wireless signals.  

 

3.1.2  Encryption  The  best  method  for  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  information 
transmitted  over  wireless  networks  is  to  encrypt  all  wireless  traffic.  This  is  especially 
important for organizations subject to regulations.  

 

3.2 Preventing Alteration of Intercepted Communications  

Interception  and  alteration  of  wireless  transmissions  represents  a  form  of  "man-in-
themiddle"  attack.  Two  types  of  countermeasures  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of 
such attacks: strong encryption and strong authentication of both devices and users.  

 

3.3 Countermeasures to Reduce the Risk of Denial-of-Service Attacks  

Wireless  communications  are  also  vulnerable  to  denial-of-service  (DoS)  attacks. 
Organizations  can  take  several  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  of  such  unintentional  DoS 
attacks.  Careful  site  surveys  can  identify  locations  where  signals  from  other  devices 
exist; the results of such surveys should be used when deciding where to locate wireless 
access points. Regular periodic audits of wireless networking activity and performance 
can  identify  problem  areas;  appropriate  remedial  actions  may  include  removal  of  the 
offending  devices  or  measures  to  increase  signal  strength  and  coverage  within  the 
problem area.  

 

4. Securing Wireless Access Points  
 

Insecure, poorly configured wireless access points can compromise confidentiality by 

allowing unauthorized access to the network.  

4.1 Countermeasures to Secure Wireless Access Points  

Organizations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  wireless  networks  by 

taking these three steps:  

1. Eliminating rogue access points;  
2. Properly configuring all authorized access points; and  
3. Using 802.1x to authenticate all devices.  

81 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

 

4.1.1 Eliminate Rogue Access Points  
 
The best method for dealing with the threat of rogue access points is to use 802.1x on the 
wired network to authenticate all devices that are plugged into the network. Using 802.1x will 
prevent any unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.  

 

4.1.2 Secure Configuration of Authorized Access Points  
 
Organizations  also  need  to  ensure  that  all  authorized  wireless  access  points  are  securely 
configured.  It  is  especially  important  to  change  all  default  settings  because  they  are 
wellknown and can be exploited by attackers.  

 
 

4.1.3 Use 802.1x to Authenticate all Devices  
 
Strong authentication of all devices attempting to connect to the network can prevent rogue 
access points and other unauthorized devices from becoming insecure backdoors. The 802.1x 
protocol  discussed  earlier  provides  a  means  for  strongly  authenticating  devices  prior  to 
assigning them IP addresses.  

 
 

5. Securing Wireless Client Devices  

Two  major  threats  to  wireless  client  devices  are  (1)  loss  or  theft,  and  (2) 
compromise. Loss or theft of laptops and PDAs is a serious problem. laptops and PDAs 
often store confidential and proprietary information. Consequently, loss or theft of the 
devices may cause the organization to be in violation of privacy regulations involving 
the  disclosure  of  personal  identifying  information  it  has  collected  from  third  parties. 
Another  threat  to  wireless  client  devices  is  that  they  can  be  compromised  so  that  an 
attacker  can  access  sensitive  information  stored  on  the  device  or  use  it  to  obtain 
unauthorized access to other system resources.  
 
 
6. Securing Wireless Networks 
 
6.1 Use of Encryption 
 

The most effective way to secure your wireless network from intruders is to encrypt, or 
scramble, communications over the network. Most wireless routers, access points, and base 
stations have a built-in encryption mechanism. If your wireless router doesn’t have an 
encryption feature, consider getting one that does. Manufacturers often deliver wireless 
routers with the encryption feature turned off. You must turn it on.  

 
 

 

82 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
6.2 Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a firewall 
 

Computers on a wireless network need the same protections as any computer connected to 
the Internet. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and keep them up-to-date. If your 
firewall was shipped in the “off” mode, turn it on. 
 
6.3 Turn off identifier broadcasting 
 

Most  wireless  routers  have  a  mechanism  called  identifier  broadcasting.  It  sends  out  a 
signal to any device in the vicinity announcing its presence. You don’t need to broadcast this 
information  if  the  person  using  the  network  already  knows  it  is  there.  Hackers  can  use 
identifier  broadcasting  to  home  in  on  vulnerable  wireless  networks.  Disable  the  identifier 
broadcasting mechanism if your wireless router allows it. 

 

6.4 Change the identifier on your router from the default 
 

The  identifier  for  your  router  is  likely  to  be  a  standard,  default  ID  assigned  by  the 
manufacturer  to  all  hardware  of  that  model.  Even  if  your  router  is  not  broadcasting  its 
identifier to the world, hackers know the default IDs and can use them to try to access your 
network. Change your identifier to something only you know, and remember to configure the 
same unique ID into your wireless router and your computer so they can communicate. Use a 
password  that’s  at  least  10  characters  long:  The  longer  your  password,  the  harder  it  is  for 
hackers to break. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.5 Change your router’s pre-set password for administration 
 

The manufacturer of your wireless router probably assigned it a standard default password 
that allows you to set up and operate the router. Hackers know these default passwords, so 
change it to something only you know. The longer the password, the tougher it is to crack. 
 
6.6 Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network 
 

Every computer that is able to communicate with a network is assigned its own unique 
Media Access Control (MAC) address. Wireless routers usually have a mechanism to allow 
only  devices  with  particular  MAC  addresses  access  to  the  network.  Some  hackers  have 
mimicked MAC addresses, so don’t rely on this step alone. 
 
6.7 Turn off your wireless network when you know you won’t use it 
 

Hackers cannot access a wireless router when it is shut down. If you turn the router off 

when you’re not using it, you limit the amount of time that it is susceptible to a hack. 
 
6.8 Don’t assume that public “hot spots” are secure

which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes. 

 

3. Securing Wireless Transmissions  

The  nature  of  wireless  communications  creates  three  basic  threats:  Interception, 

Alteration and Disruption.  

3.1 Protecting the Confidentiality of Wireless Transmissions  

Two  types  of  countermeasures  exist  for  reducing  the  risk  of  eavesdropping  on 
wireless transmissions. The first involves methods for making it more difficult to locate 
and intercept the wireless signals. The second involves the use of encryption to preserve 
confidentiality even if the wireless signal is intercepted.  

 

3.1.1  Signal-Hiding Techniques In order to intercept wireless transmissions, attackers first 
need  to  identify  and  locate  wireless  networks.  There  are,  however,  a  number  of  steps  that 

80 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
organizations  can  take  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  locate  their  wireless  access  points.  The 
easiest  and  least  costly  include  the  following:  Turning  offthe  service  set  identifier  (SSID) 
broadcasting  by  wireless  access  points,  Assign  cryptic  names  to  SSIDs,  Reducing  signal 
strength to the lowest level that still provides requisite coverage or Locating wireless access 
points in the interior of the building, away from windows and exterior walls. More effective, 
but  also  more  costly  methods  for  reducing  or  hiding  signals  include:  Using  directional 
antennas to constrain signal emanations within desired areas of coverage or Using of signal 
emanation-shielding techniques, sometimes referred to as TEMPEST, 1 to block emanation of 
wireless signals.  

 

3.1.2  Encryption  The  best  method  for  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  information 
transmitted  over  wireless  networks  is  to  encrypt  all  wireless  traffic.  This  is  especially 
important for organizations subject to regulations.  

 

3.2 Preventing Alteration of Intercepted Communications  

Interception  and  alteration  of  wireless  transmissions  represents  a  form  of  "man-in-
themiddle"  attack.  Two  types  of  countermeasures  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of 
such attacks: strong encryption and strong authentication of both devices and users.  

 

3.3 Countermeasures to Reduce the Risk of Denial-of-Service Attacks  

Wireless  communications  are  also  vulnerable  to  denial-of-service  (DoS)  attacks. 
Organizations  can  take  several  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  of  such  unintentional  DoS 
attacks.  Careful  site  surveys  can  identify  locations  where  signals  from  other  devices 
exist; the results of such surveys should be used when deciding where to locate wireless 
access points. Regular periodic audits of wireless networking activity and performance 
can  identify  problem  areas;  appropriate  remedial  actions  may  include  removal  of  the 
offending  devices  or  measures  to  increase  signal  strength  and  coverage  within  the 
problem area.  

 

4. Securing Wireless Access Points  
 

Insecure, poorly configured wireless access points can compromise confidentiality by 

allowing unauthorized access to the network.  

4.1 Countermeasures to Secure Wireless Access Points  

Organizations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  wireless  networks  by 

taking these three steps:  

1. Eliminating rogue access points;  
2. Properly configuring all authorized access points; and  
3. Using 802.1x to authenticate all devices.  

81 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

 

4.1.1 Eliminate Rogue Access Points  
 
The best method for dealing with the threat of rogue access points is to use 802.1x on the 
wired network to authenticate all devices that are plugged into the network. Using 802.1x will 
prevent any unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.  

 

4.1.2 Secure Configuration of Authorized Access Points  
 
Organizations  also  need  to  ensure  that  all  authorized  wireless  access  points  are  securely 
configured.  It  is  especially  important  to  change  all  default  settings  because  they  are 
wellknown and can be exploited by attackers.  

 
 

4.1.3 Use 802.1x to Authenticate all Devices  
 
Strong authentication of all devices attempting to connect to the network can prevent rogue 
access points and other unauthorized devices from becoming insecure backdoors. The 802.1x 
protocol  discussed  earlier  provides  a  means  for  strongly  authenticating  devices  prior  to 
assigning them IP addresses.  

 
 

5. Securing Wireless Client Devices  

Two  major  threats  to  wireless  client  devices  are  (1)  loss  or  theft,  and  (2) 
compromise. Loss or theft of laptops and PDAs is a serious problem. laptops and PDAs 
often store confidential and proprietary information. Consequently, loss or theft of the 
devices may cause the organization to be in violation of privacy regulations involving 
the  disclosure  of  personal  identifying  information  it  has  collected  from  third  parties. 
Another  threat  to  wireless  client  devices  is  that  they  can  be  compromised  so  that  an 
attacker  can  access  sensitive  information  stored  on  the  device  or  use  it  to  obtain 
unauthorized access to other system resources.  
 
 
6. Securing Wireless Networks 
 
6.1 Use of Encryption 
 

The most effective way to secure your wireless network from intruders is to encrypt, or 
scramble, communications over the network. Most wireless routers, access points, and base 
stations have a built-in encryption mechanism. If your wireless router doesn’t have an 
encryption feature, consider getting one that does. Manufacturers often deliver wireless 
routers with the encryption feature turned off. You must turn it on.  

 
 

 

82 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
6.2 Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a firewall 
 

Computers on a wireless network need the same protections as any computer connected to 
the Internet. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and keep them up-to-date. If your 
firewall was shipped in the “off” mode, turn it on. 
 
6.3 Turn off identifier broadcasting 
 

Most  wireless  routers  have  a  mechanism  called  identifier  broadcasting.  It  sends  out  a 
signal to any device in the vicinity announcing its presence. You don’t need to broadcast this 
information  if  the  person  using  the  network  already  knows  it  is  there.  Hackers  can  use 
identifier  broadcasting  to  home  in  on  vulnerable  wireless  networks.  Disable  the  identifier 
broadcasting mechanism if your wireless router allows it. 

 

6.4 Change the identifier on your router from the default 
 

The  identifier  for  your  router  is  likely  to  be  a  standard,  default  ID  assigned  by  the 
manufacturer  to  all  hardware  of  that  model.  Even  if  your  router  is  not  broadcasting  its 
identifier to the world, hackers know the default IDs and can use them to try to access your 
network. Change your identifier to something only you know, and remember to configure the 
same unique ID into your wireless router and your computer so they can communicate. Use a 
password  that’s  at  least  10  characters  long:  The  longer  your  password,  the  harder  it  is  for 
hackers to break. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.5 Change your router’s pre-set password for administration 
 

The manufacturer of your wireless router probably assigned it a standard default password 
that allows you to set up and operate the router. Hackers know these default passwords, so 
change it to something only you know. The longer the password, the tougher it is to crack. 
 
6.6 Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network 
 

Every computer that is able to communicate with a network is assigned its own unique 
Media Access Control (MAC) address. Wireless routers usually have a mechanism to allow 
only  devices  with  particular  MAC  addresses  access  to  the  network.  Some  hackers  have 
mimicked MAC addresses, so don’t rely on this step alone. 
 
6.7 Turn off your wireless network when you know you won’t use it 
 

Hackers cannot access a wireless router when it is shut down. If you turn the router off 

when you’re not using it, you limit the amount of time that it is susceptible to a hack. 
 
6.8 Don’t assume that public “hot spots” are secure 
 

83 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

Many cafés, hotels, airports, and other public establishments offer wireless networks for 

their customers’ use.  

 
 

7. Training and Educating Users  

Notice  that  Figure  1  also  includes  users  as  the  fourth  basic  component  of  wireless 
networking. As is the case with wired security, users are the key component to wireless 
networking  security.  Indeed,  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  about 
secure  wireless  behavior  cannot  be  overstated.  To  be  effective,  user  training  and 
education needs to be repeated periodically.  
 
8. Network Auditing 
 

Wireless  network  auditing  is  an  important  part  of  WLAN  security  policy.  The  network 
needs to be regularly audited for rouge hardware. In this method the network is scanned and 
mapped for all access points and WLAN nodes. Then this is compared with previous network 
map. Commonly available network mapping tools like netstumbler and wavelan-tool can be 
used to do this. Specialized tools such as Airsnort can be used for WEP cracking and auditing 
the network for weak keys, key reuse and WEP security settings. These methods include the 
same tests as those carried out by hackers for breaking into the network. 
 

 

9. Conclusion  

Wireless  networking  provides  numerous  opportunities  to  increase  productivity  and 
cut  costs.  It  also  alters  an  organization’s  overall  computer  security  risk  profile. 
Although  it  is  impossible  to  totally  eliminate  all  risks  associated  with  wireless 
networking, it is possible to achieve a reasonable level of overall security by adopting a 
systematic  approach  to  assessing  and  managing  risk.  This  paper  discussed  the  threats 
and  vulnerabilities  associated  with  each  of  the  three  basic  technology  components  of 
wireless networks (clients, access points, and the transmission medium) and described 
various commonly available countermeasures that could be used to mitigate those risks. 
It  also  stressed  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  in  safe  wireless 
networking procedures.

Abstract 

 
Wireless  networking  provides  many  advantages,  but  it  also  coupled  with  new  security 
threats  and  alters  the  organization’s  overall  information  security  risk  profile.  Although 
implementation  of  technological  solutions  is  the  usual  respond  to  wireless  security  threats 
and vulnerabilities, wireless security is primarily a management issue. Effective management 
of the threats associated with wireless technology requires a sound and thorough assessment 
of risk given the environment and development  of a plan to mitigate identified threats. We 
present a framework to help managers understand and assess the various threats associated 
with  the  use  of  wireless  technology.  We  also  discuss  a  number  of  available  solutions  for 
countering those threats.

1. Introduction  

to 

information 

Wireless  networking  presents  many  advantages  Productivity  improves  because  of 
resources.  Network  configuration  and 
increased  accessibility 
reconfiguration is easier, faster, and less expensive. However, wireless technology also 
creates  new  threats  and  alters  the  existing  information  security  risk  profile.  For 
example, because communications takes place "through the air" using radio frequencies, 
the  risk  of  interception  is  greater  than  with  wired  networks.  If  the  message  is  not 
encrypted,  or  encrypted  with  a  weak  algorithm,  the  attacker  can  read  it,  thereby 
compromising confidentiality. Although wireless networking alters the risks associated 
with various threats to security, the overall security objectives remain the same as with 
wired  networks:  preserving  confidentiality,  ensuring 
integrity,  and  maintaining 
availability of the information and information systems. The objective of this paper is 
to  assist  managers  in  making  such  decisions  by  providing  them  with  a  basic 
understanding of the nature of the various threats associated with wireless networking 
and available countermeasures.  

The  popularity  of  wireless  Networks  is  a  testament  primarily  to  their  convenience,  cost 
efficiency,  and  ease  of  integration  with  other  networks  and  network  components.  The 
majority of computers sold to consumers today come pre-equipped with all necessary wireless 
Networks  technology.  The  benefits  of  wireless  Networks  include:  Convenience,  Mobility, 
Productivity, Deployment, Expandability and Cost.

Wireless  Network  technology,  while  replete  with  the  conveniences  and  advantages 
described  above  has  its  share  of  downfalls.  For  a  given  networking  situation,  wireless 
Networks may not be desirable for a number of reasons. Most of these have to do with the 
inherent  limitations  of  the  technology.  The  disadvantages  of  using  a  wireless  network  are: 
Security, Range, Reliability, and Speed.  

 
Wireless  Networks  present  a  host  of  issues  for  network  managers.  Unauthorized  access 
points, broadcasted SSIDs, unknown stations, and spoofed MAC addresses are just a few of 
the problems addressed in WLAN troubleshooting. Most network analysis vendors, such as 
Network  Instruments,  Network  General,  and  Fluke,  offer  WLAN  troubleshooting  tools  or 
functionalities as part of their product line. 

 

2. Wireless Vulnerabilities, Threats and Countermeasures  

The  wireless  networks  consist  of  four  basic  components:  The  transmission  of  data 
using  radio frequencies;  Access  points  that  provide  a  connection  to  the  organizational 
network  and/or  the  Client  devices  (laptops,  PDAs,  etc.);  and  Users.  Each  of  these 
components provides an avenue for attack that can result in the compromise of one or 
more  of  the  three  fundamental  security  objectives  of  confidentiality,  integrity,  and 
availability.

2.1 Wireless Network Attacks 
 
2.1.1 Accidental association 

Unauthorized  access  to  company  wireless  and  wired  networks  can  come  from  a 
number  of  different  methods  and  intents.  One  of  these  methods  is  referred  to  as 
“accidental  association”.  When  a  user  turns  on  a  computer  and  it  latches  on  to  a 
wireless access point from a neighboring company’s overlapping network, the user may 
not  even  know  that  this  has  occurred.  However,  it  is  a  security  breach  in  that 
proprietary company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one 
company  to  the  other.  This  is  especially  true  if  the  laptop  is  also  hooked  to  a  wired 
network. 
 
 

78 

 
2.1.2 Malicious association 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

“Malicious associations” are when wireless devices can be actively made by crackers 
to  connect  to  a  company  network  through  their  cracking  laptop  instead  of  a  company 
access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when 
a  cracker  runs  some  software  that  makes  his/her  wireless  network  card  look  like  a 
legitimate access point. Once the cracker has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, 
launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate 
at  the  Layer  2  level,  Layer  3  protections  such  as  network  authentication  and  virtual 
private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with 
protection but are still vulnerable to cracking. The idea behind this type of attack may 
not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the cracker is just 
trying to take over the client at the Layer 2 level. 

 

2.1.3 Ad-hoc networks 

Ad-hoc networks can pose a security threat. Ad-hoc networks are defined as peer-to-
peer networks between wireless computers that do not have an access point in between 
them. While these types of networks usually have little protection, encryption methods 
can be used to provide security. 

 

2.1.4 Non-traditional networks 

Non-traditional  networks  such  as  personal  network  Bluetooth  devices  are  not  safe 
from  cracking  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  Even  barcode  readers, 
handheld  PDAs,  and  wireless  printers  and  copiers  should  be  secured.  These  non-
traditional  networks  can  be  easily  overlooked  by  IT  personnel  who  have  narrowly 
focused on laptops and access points. 

 

2.1.5 Identity theft (MAC spoofing) 

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on 
network  traffic  and  identify  the  MAC  address  of  a  computer  with  network  privileges. 
Most  wireless  systems  allow  some  kind  of  MAC  filtering  to  only  allow  authorized 
computers  with  specific  MAC  IDs  to  gain  access  and  utilize  the  network.  However,  a 
number  of  programs  exist  that  have  network  “sniffing”  capabilities.  Combine  these 
programs with other software that allow a computer to pretend it has any MAC address 
that the cracker desires, and the cracker can easily get around that hurdle. 

 

2.1.6 Man-in-the-middle attacks 

A man-in-the-middle attacker entices computers to log into a computer which is set 
up as a soft AP (Access Point). Once this is done, the hacker connects to a real access 
point  through  another  wireless  card  offering  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  through  the 
transparent hacking computer to the real network. The hacker can then sniff the traffic. 
One  type  of  man-in-the-middle  attack  relies  on  security  faults  in  challenge  and 
handshake  protocols  to  execute  a  “de-authentication  attack”.  This  attack  forces  AP-

79 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 
connected computers to drop their connections and reconnect with the cracker’s soft AP. 
Man-in-the-middle  attacks  are  enhanced  by  software  such  as  LANjack  and  AirJack, 
which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes.

Another  threat  to  wireless  client  devices  is  that  they  can  be  compromised  so  that  an 
attacker  can  access  sensitive  information  stored  on  the  device  or  use  it  to  obtain 
unauthorized access to other system resources.  
 
 
6. Securing Wireless Networks 
 
6.1 Use of Encryption 
 

The most effective way to secure your wireless network from intruders is to encrypt, or 
scramble, communications over the network. Most wireless routers, access points, and base 
stations have a built-in encryption mechanism. If your wireless router doesn’t have an 
encryption feature, consider getting one that does. Manufacturers often deliver wireless 
routers with the encryption feature turned off. You must turn it on.

Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
6.2 Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a firewall 
 

Computers on a wireless network need the same protections as any computer connected to 
the Internet. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and keep them up-to-date. If your 
firewall was shipped in the “off” mode, turn it on. 
 
6.3 Turn off identifier broadcasting 
 

Most  wireless  routers  have  a  mechanism  called  identifier  broadcasting.  It  sends  out  a 
signal to any device in the vicinity announcing its presence. You don’t need to broadcast this 
information  if  the  person  using  the  network  already  knows  it  is  there.  Hackers  can  use 
identifier  broadcasting  to  home  in  on  vulnerable  wireless  networks.  Disable  the  identifier 
broadcasting mechanism if your wireless router allows it. 

 

6.4 Change the identifier on your router from the default 
 

The  identifier  for  your  router  is  likely  to  be  a  standard,  default  ID  assigned  by  the 
manufacturer  to  all  hardware  of  that  model.  Even  if  your  router  is  not  broadcasting  its 
identifier to the world, hackers know the default IDs and can use them to try to access your 
network. Change your identifier to something only you know, and remember to configure the 
same unique ID into your wireless router and your computer so they can communicate. Use a 
password  that’s  at  least  10  characters  long:  The  longer  your  password,  the  harder  it  is  for 
hackers to break. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.5 Change your router’s pre-set password for administration 
 

The manufacturer of your wireless router probably assigned it a standard default password 
that allows you to set up and operate the router. Hackers know these default passwords, so 
change it to something only you know. The longer the password, the tougher it is to crack. 
 
6.6 Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network 
 

Every computer that is able to communicate with a network is assigned its own unique 
Media Access Control (MAC) address. Wireless routers usually have a mechanism to allow 
only  devices  with  particular  MAC  addresses  access  to  the  network.  Some  hackers  have 
mimicked MAC addresses, so don’t rely on this step alone. 
 
6.7 Turn off your wireless network when you know you won’t use it 
 

Hackers cannot access a wireless router when it is shut down. If you turn the router off 

when you’re not using it, you limit the amount of time that it is susceptible to a hack. 
 
6.8 Don’t assume that public “hot spots” are secure 
 

83 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

Many cafés, hotels, airports, and other public establishments offer wireless networks for 

their customers’ use.  

 
 

7. Training and Educating Users  

Notice  that  Figure  1  also  includes  users  as  the  fourth  basic  component  of  wireless 
networking. As is the case with wired security, users are the key component to wireless 
networking  security.  Indeed,  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  about 
secure  wireless  behavior  cannot  be  overstated.  To  be  effective,  user  training  and 
education needs to be repeated periodically.  
 
8. Network Auditing 
 

Wireless  network  auditing  is  an  important  part  of  WLAN  security  policy.  The  network 
needs to be regularly audited for rouge hardware. In this method the network is scanned and 
mapped for all access points and WLAN nodes. Then this is compared with previous network 
map. Commonly available network mapping tools like netstumbler and wavelan-tool can be 
used to do this. Specialized tools such as Airsnort can be used for WEP cracking and auditing 
the network for weak keys, key reuse and WEP security settings. These methods include the 
same tests as those carried out by hackers for breaking into the network. 
 

 

9. Conclusion  

Wireless  networking  provides  numerous  opportunities  to  increase  productivity  and 
cut  costs.  It  also  alters  an  organization’s  overall  computer  security  risk  profile. 
Although  it  is  impossible  to  totally  eliminate  all  risks  associated  with  wireless 
networking, it is possible to achieve a reasonable level of overall security by adopting a 
systematic  approach  to  assessing  and  managing  risk.  This  paper  discussed  the  threats 
and  vulnerabilities  associated  with  each  of  the  three  basic  technology  components  of 
wireless networks (clients, access points, and the transmission medium) and described 
various commonly available countermeasures that could be used to mitigate those risks. 
It  also  stressed  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  in  safe  wireless 
networking procedures.

Abstract 

 
Wireless  networking  provides  many  advantages,  but  it  also  coupled  with  new  security 
threats  and  alters  the  organization’s  overall  information  security  risk  profile.  Although 
implementation  of  technological  solutions  is  the  usual  respond  to  wireless  security  threats 
and vulnerabilities, wireless security is primarily a management issue. Effective management 
of the threats associated with wireless technology requires a sound and thorough assessment 
of risk given the environment and development  of a plan to mitigate identified threats. We 
present a framework to help managers understand and assess the various threats associated 
with  the  use  of  wireless  technology.  We  also  discuss  a  number  of  available  solutions  for 
countering those threats. 

  
Keywords : Wireless Network, Wireless Security, Wireless Threats, Signal-Hiding  

 
 
1. Introduction  

to 

information 

Wireless  networking  presents  many  advantages  Productivity  improves  because  of 
resources.  Network  configuration  and 
increased  accessibility 
reconfiguration is easier, faster, and less expensive. However, wireless technology also 
creates  new  threats  and  alters  the  existing  information  security  risk  profile.  For 
example, because communications takes place "through the air" using radio frequencies, 
the  risk  of  interception  is  greater  than  with  wired  networks.  If  the  message  is  not 
encrypted,  or  encrypted  with  a  weak  algorithm,  the  attacker  can  read  it,  thereby 
compromising confidentiality. Although wireless networking alters the risks associated 
with various threats to security, the overall security objectives remain the same as with 
wired  networks:  preserving  confidentiality,  ensuring 
integrity,  and  maintaining 
availability of the information and information systems. The objective of this paper is 
to  assist  managers  in  making  such  decisions  by  providing  them  with  a  basic 
understanding of the nature of the various threats associated with wireless networking 
and available countermeasures.  

The  popularity  of  wireless  Networks  is  a  testament  primarily  to  their  convenience,  cost 
efficiency,  and  ease  of  integration  with  other  networks  and  network  components.  The 
majority of computers sold to consumers today come pre-equipped with all necessary wireless 
Networks  technology.  The  benefits  of  wireless  Networks  include:  Convenience,  Mobility, 
Productivity, Deployment, Expandability and Cost.

Wireless  Network  technology,  while  replete  with  the  conveniences  and  advantages 
described  above  has  its  share  of  downfalls.  For  a  given  networking  situation,  wireless 
Networks may not be desirable for a number of reasons. Most of these have to do with the 
inherent  limitations  of  the  technology.  The  disadvantages  of  using  a  wireless  network  are: 
Security, Range, Reliability, and Speed.  

 
Wireless  Networks  present  a  host  of  issues  for  network  managers.  Unauthorized  access 
points, broadcasted SSIDs, unknown stations, and spoofed MAC addresses are just a few of 
the problems addressed in WLAN troubleshooting. Most network analysis vendors, such as 
Network  Instruments,  Network  General,  and  Fluke,  offer  WLAN  troubleshooting  tools  or 
functionalities as part of their product line. 

 

2. Wireless Vulnerabilities, Threats and Countermeasures  

The  wireless  networks  consist  of  four  basic  components:  The  transmission  of  data 
using  radio frequencies;  Access  points  that  provide  a  connection  to  the  organizational 
network  and/or  the  Client  devices  (laptops,  PDAs,  etc.);  and  Users.  Each  of  these 
components provides an avenue for attack that can result in the compromise of one or 
more  of  the  three  fundamental  security  objectives  of  confidentiality,  integrity,  and 
availability.

2.1 Wireless Network Attacks 
 
2.1.1 Accidental association 

Unauthorized  access  to  company  wireless  and  wired  networks  can  come  from  a 
number  of  different  methods  and  intents.  One  of  these  methods  is  referred  to  as 
“accidental  association”.  When  a  user  turns  on  a  computer  and  it  latches  on  to  a 
wireless access point from a neighboring company’s overlapping network, the user may 
not  even  know  that  this  has  occurred.  However,  it  is  a  security  breach  in  that 
proprietary company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one 
company  to  the  other.  This  is  especially  true  if  the  laptop  is  also  hooked  to  a  wired 
network. 
 
 

78 

 
2.1.2 Malicious association 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

“Malicious associations” are when wireless devices can be actively made by crackers 
to  connect  to  a  company  network  through  their  cracking  laptop  instead  of  a  company 
access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when 
a  cracker  runs  some  software  that  makes  his/her  wireless  network  card  look  like  a 
legitimate access point. Once the cracker has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, 
launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate 
at  the  Layer  2  level,  Layer  3  protections  such  as  network  authentication  and  virtual 
private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with 
protection but are still vulnerable to cracking. The idea behind this type of attack may 
not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the cracker is just 
trying to take over the client at the Layer 2 level. 

 

2.1.3 Ad-hoc networks 

Ad-hoc networks can pose a security threat. Ad-hoc networks are defined as peer-to-
peer networks between wireless computers that do not have an access point in between 
them. While these types of networks usually have little protection, encryption methods 
can be used to provide security. 

 

2.1.4 Non-traditional networks 

Non-traditional  networks  such  as  personal  network  Bluetooth  devices  are  not  safe 
from  cracking  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  Even  barcode  readers, 
handheld  PDAs,  and  wireless  printers  and  copiers  should  be  secured.  These  non-
traditional  networks  can  be  easily  overlooked  by  IT  personnel  who  have  narrowly 
focused on laptops and access points. 

 

2.1.5 Identity theft (MAC spoofing) 

Identity  theft  (or  MAC  spoofing)  occurs  when  a  cracker  is  able  to  listen  in  on 
network  traffic  and  identify  the  MAC  address  of  a  computer  with  network  privileges. 
Most  wireless  systems  allow  some  kind  of  MAC  filtering  to  only  allow  authorized 
computers  with  specific  MAC  IDs  to  gain  access  and  utilize  the  network.  However,  a 
number  of  programs  exist  that  have  network  “sniffing”  capabilities.  Combine  these 
programs with other software that allow a computer to pretend it has any MAC address 
that the cracker desires, and the cracker can easily get around that hurdle. 

 

2.1.6 Man-in-the-middle attacks 

A man-in-the-middle attacker entices computers to log into a computer which is set 
up as a soft AP (Access Point). Once this is done, the hacker connects to a real access 
point  through  another  wireless  card  offering  a  steady  flow  of  traffic  through  the 
transparent hacking computer to the real network. The hacker can then sniff the traffic. 
One  type  of  man-in-the-middle  attack  relies  on  security  faults  in  challenge  and 
handshake  protocols  to  execute  a  “de-authentication  attack”.  This  attack  forces  AP-

79 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 
connected computers to drop their connections and reconnect with the cracker’s soft AP. 
Man-in-the-middle  attacks  are  enhanced  by  software  such  as  LANjack  and  AirJack, 
which automate multiple steps of the process. What once required some skill can now 
be done by script kiddies. Hotspots are particularly vulnerable to any attack since there 
is little to no security on these networks. 

 

2.1.7 Denial of service 

A  Denial-of-Service  attack  (DoS)  occurs  when  an  attacker  continually  bombards  a 
targeted  AP  (Access  Point)  or  network  with  bogus  requests,  premature  successful 
connection messages, failure messages, and/or other commands. These cause legitimate 
users  to  not  be  able  to  get  on  the  network  and  may  even  cause  the  network  to  crash. 
These  attacks  rely  on  the  abuse  of  protocols  such  as  the  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 

 

2.1.8 Network injection 

In  a  network  injection  attack,  a  cracker  can  make  use  of  access  points  that  are 
exposed  to  non-filtered  network  traffic,  specifically  broadcasting  network  traffic  such 
as  “Spanning  Tree”  (802.1D),  OSPF,  RIP,  and  HSRP.  The  cracker  injects  bogus 
networking  re-configuration  commands  that  affect  routers,  switches,  and  intelligent 
hubs.  A  whole  network  can  be  brought  down  in  this  manner  and  require  rebooting  or 
even reprogramming of all intelligent networking devices. 

 

2.1.9 Caffe Latte attack 

The  Caffe  Latte  attack  is  another  way  to  defeat  WEP.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the 
attacker  to  be  in  the  area  of  the  network  using  this  exploit.  By  using  a  process  that 
targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote 
client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of 
the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The 
attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes. 

 

3. Securing Wireless Transmissions  

The  nature  of  wireless  communications  creates  three  basic  threats:  Interception, 

Alteration and Disruption.  

3.1 Protecting the Confidentiality of Wireless Transmissions  

Two  types  of  countermeasures  exist  for  reducing  the  risk  of  eavesdropping  on 
wireless transmissions. The first involves methods for making it more difficult to locate 
and intercept the wireless signals. The second involves the use of encryption to preserve 
confidentiality even if the wireless signal is intercepted.  

 

3.1.1  Signal-Hiding Techniques In order to intercept wireless transmissions, attackers first 
need  to  identify  and  locate  wireless  networks.  There  are,  however,  a  number  of  steps  that 

80 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
organizations  can  take  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  locate  their  wireless  access  points.  The 
easiest  and  least  costly  include  the  following:  Turning  offthe  service  set  identifier  (SSID) 
broadcasting  by  wireless  access  points,  Assign  cryptic  names  to  SSIDs,  Reducing  signal 
strength to the lowest level that still provides requisite coverage or Locating wireless access 
points in the interior of the building, away from windows and exterior walls. More effective, 
but  also  more  costly  methods  for  reducing  or  hiding  signals  include:  Using  directional 
antennas to constrain signal emanations within desired areas of coverage or Using of signal 
emanation-shielding techniques, sometimes referred to as TEMPEST, 1 to block emanation of 
wireless signals.  

 

3.1.2  Encryption  The  best  method  for  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  information 
transmitted  over  wireless  networks  is  to  encrypt  all  wireless  traffic.  This  is  especially 
important for organizations subject to regulations.  

 

3.2 Preventing Alteration of Intercepted Communications  

Interception  and  alteration  of  wireless  transmissions  represents  a  form  of  "man-in-
themiddle"  attack.  Two  types  of  countermeasures  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of 
such attacks: strong encryption and strong authentication of both devices and users.  

 

3.3 Countermeasures to Reduce the Risk of Denial-of-Service Attacks  

Wireless  communications  are  also  vulnerable  to  denial-of-service  (DoS)  attacks. 
Organizations  can  take  several  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  of  such  unintentional  DoS 
attacks.  Careful  site  surveys  can  identify  locations  where  signals  from  other  devices 
exist; the results of such surveys should be used when deciding where to locate wireless 
access points. Regular periodic audits of wireless networking activity and performance 
can  identify  problem  areas;  appropriate  remedial  actions  may  include  removal  of  the 
offending  devices  or  measures  to  increase  signal  strength  and  coverage  within  the 
problem area.  

 

4. Securing Wireless Access Points  
 

Insecure, poorly configured wireless access points can compromise confidentiality by 

allowing unauthorized access to the network.  

4.1 Countermeasures to Secure Wireless Access Points  

Organizations  can  reduce  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  to  wireless  networks  by 

taking these three steps:  

1. Eliminating rogue access points;  
2. Properly configuring all authorized access points; and  
3. Using 802.1x to authenticate all devices.  

81 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

 

4.1.1 Eliminate Rogue Access Points  
 
The best method for dealing with the threat of rogue access points is to use 802.1x on the 
wired network to authenticate all devices that are plugged into the network. Using 802.1x will 
prevent any unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.  

 

4.1.2 Secure Configuration of Authorized Access Points  
 
Organizations  also  need  to  ensure  that  all  authorized  wireless  access  points  are  securely 
configured.  It  is  especially  important  to  change  all  default  settings  because  they  are 
wellknown and can be exploited by attackers.  

 
 

4.1.3 Use 802.1x to Authenticate all Devices  
 
Strong authentication of all devices attempting to connect to the network can prevent rogue 
access points and other unauthorized devices from becoming insecure backdoors. The 802.1x 
protocol  discussed  earlier  provides  a  means  for  strongly  authenticating  devices  prior  to 
assigning them IP addresses.  

 
 

5. Securing Wireless Client Devices  

Two  major  threats  to  wireless  client  devices  are  (1)  loss  or  theft,  and  (2) 
compromise. Loss or theft of laptops and PDAs is a serious problem. laptops and PDAs 
often store confidential and proprietary information. Consequently, loss or theft of the 
devices may cause the organization to be in violation of privacy regulations involving 
the  disclosure  of  personal  identifying  information  it  has  collected  from  third  parties. 
Another  threat  to  wireless  client  devices  is  that  they  can  be  compromised  so  that  an 
attacker  can  access  sensitive  information  stored  on  the  device  or  use  it  to  obtain 
unauthorized access to other system resources.  
 
 
6. Securing Wireless Networks 
 
6.1 Use of Encryption 
 

The most effective way to secure your wireless network from intruders is to encrypt, or 
scramble, communications over the network. Most wireless routers, access points, and base 
stations have a built-in encryption mechanism. If your wireless router doesn’t have an 
encryption feature, consider getting one that does. Manufacturers often deliver wireless 
routers with the encryption feature turned off. You must turn it on.  

 
 

 

82 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 

 
6.2 Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a firewall 
 

Computers on a wireless network need the same protections as any computer connected to 
the Internet. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and keep them up-to-date. If your 
firewall was shipped in the “off” mode, turn it on. 
 
6.3 Turn off identifier broadcasting 
 

Most  wireless  routers  have  a  mechanism  called  identifier  broadcasting.  It  sends  out  a 
signal to any device in the vicinity announcing its presence. You don’t need to broadcast this 
information  if  the  person  using  the  network  already  knows  it  is  there.  Hackers  can  use 
identifier  broadcasting  to  home  in  on  vulnerable  wireless  networks.  Disable  the  identifier 
broadcasting mechanism if your wireless router allows it. 

 

6.4 Change the identifier on your router from the default 
 

The  identifier  for  your  router  is  likely  to  be  a  standard,  default  ID  assigned  by  the 
manufacturer  to  all  hardware  of  that  model.  Even  if  your  router  is  not  broadcasting  its 
identifier to the world, hackers know the default IDs and can use them to try to access your 
network. Change your identifier to something only you know, and remember to configure the 
same unique ID into your wireless router and your computer so they can communicate. Use a 
password  that’s  at  least  10  characters  long:  The  longer  your  password,  the  harder  it  is  for 
hackers to break. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.5 Change your router’s pre-set password for administration 
 

The manufacturer of your wireless router probably assigned it a standard default password 
that allows you to set up and operate the router. Hackers know these default passwords, so 
change it to something only you know. The longer the password, the tougher it is to crack. 
 
6.6 Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network 
 

Every computer that is able to communicate with a network is assigned its own unique 
Media Access Control (MAC) address. Wireless routers usually have a mechanism to allow 
only  devices  with  particular  MAC  addresses  access  to  the  network.  Some  hackers  have 
mimicked MAC addresses, so don’t rely on this step alone. 
 
6.7 Turn off your wireless network when you know you won’t use it 
 

Hackers cannot access a wireless router when it is shut down. If you turn the router off 

when you’re not using it, you limit the amount of time that it is susceptible to a hack. 
 
6.8 Don’t assume that public “hot spots” are secure 
 

83 

International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 
Vol. 3, No. 3, July, 2008 
 
 

Many cafés, hotels, airports, and other public establishments offer wireless networks for 

their customers’ use.  

 
 

7. Training and Educating Users  

Notice  that  Figure  1  also  includes  users  as  the  fourth  basic  component  of  wireless 
networking. As is the case with wired security, users are the key component to wireless 
networking  security.  Indeed,  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  about 
secure  wireless  behavior  cannot  be  overstated.  To  be  effective,  user  training  and 
education needs to be repeated periodically.  
 
8. Network Auditing 
 

Wireless  network  auditing  is  an  important  part  of  WLAN  security  policy.  The  network 
needs to be regularly audited for rouge hardware. In this method the network is scanned and 
mapped for all access points and WLAN nodes. Then this is compared with previous network 
map. Commonly available network mapping tools like netstumbler and wavelan-tool can be 
used to do this. Specialized tools such as Airsnort can be used for WEP cracking and auditing 
the network for weak keys, key reuse and WEP security settings. These methods include the 
same tests as those carried out by hackers for breaking into the network. 
 

 

9. Conclusion  

Wireless  networking  provides  numerous  opportunities  to  increase  productivity  and 
cut  costs.  It  also  alters  an  organization’s  overall  computer  security  risk  profile. 
Although  it  is  impossible  to  totally  eliminate  all  risks  associated  with  wireless 
networking, it is possible to achieve a reasonable level of overall security by adopting a 
systematic  approach  to  assessing  and  managing  risk.  This  paper  discussed  the  threats 
and  vulnerabilities  associated  with  each  of  the  three  basic  technology  components  of 
wireless networks (clients, access points, and the transmission medium) and described 
various commonly available countermeasures that could be used to mitigate those risks. 
It  also  stressed  the  importance  of  training  and  educating  users  in  safe  wireless 
networking procedures.
