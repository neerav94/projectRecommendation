INTRODUCTION 

In  the  21st  century  people  are  concerned  about  their  safety,  for  their  valuable  things.  Old  concepts  and 
devices  are  getting  modified  as  per  requirement  of  people.  In  day  to  day  life  we  need  to  seek  new  security 
arrangement.  Thus  we  evolve  to  provide  the  maximum  level  security  scheme.  In  this  present  age,  safety  was 
becoming an all important event for most of the masses, especially in the rural and urban regions. Some people 
will try to cheat or steal the property which may endanger the safety of money in the bank, house, and office. To 
defeat the security threat, a most of people will install a bunch of locks or alarm system. There are many types 
of alarm systems available in the market, which utilizes different types of sensor. The sensor can detect different 
types of changes occur in the surrounding and the changes will be processed to be given out an alert according 
to the pre-set value. By the same time this scheme may not be beneficial for all the time. Sensing elements are 
small  hardware  devices  similar  in  flavor  to  RFID  tags.  While  RFID  tags  emit  identifiers,  sensors  emit 
information about their environments, like ambient temperature or humidity. Sensors typically contain batteries, 
and  are  thus  larger  and  more  expensive  than  passive  RFID  tags.  Between  active  RFID  tags  and  sensors, 
however,  there  is  little  difference  but  nomenclature.  For  example,  some  commercially  available  active  RFID 
devices are designed to secure port containers. They emit identifiers, but also sense whether or not a container 
has  been  opened.  Given  such  examples,  there  is  surprisingly  little  overlap  between  the  literature  on  sensor 
security  and  that  on  RFID  security.  The  boundaries  between  wireless-device  types  will  inevitably  blur,  as 
evidenced by the dual role of reader and tag played by NFC devices. Using machine motion techniques, in our 
approach logical patterns are obtained from physical sensor attached to the system [1].

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Shweta  J  Suggest  that  earlier  security  for  Bank  system  is  not  very  much  efficient.  Banks  provide  a 
locker system for their customers for  safe keeping. In the current locker system, there is no separate banker to 
bring  maintenance  and  pay  heed  to  people  wishing  to  access  lockers.  Her  project  aims  to  change  the  existing 
system  and  automate  the  locker  system  using  RFID  tags  for  customer  identification.  Every  client  is  granted  a 
unique RFID card with a unique number so that the customer can be identified and access can be allotted to the 
customer‟s locker [4].R Ramani & P. Niranjan et al. Expresses his view like that  is to design and implement a 
bank    locker  security  system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology  which  can  be  organized  in  banks,  secured 
offices and homes. In this system merely an authentic person can be recovered money from bank  locker. They 
have  carried  out  a  bank  locker  security  system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology  containing  door  locking 
system  using  RFID  and  GSM,  which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validates  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in 
real  time  for  bank  locker  secure  access.  It  is  a  low  cost,  low  in  power  conception,  compact  in  size  and  stand 
alone system. The microcontroller compares the passwords entered by keyboard and received through  a mobile 
phone [2]. 

 
K  Chandrasekar  et  al.  They  propose  Motion  Controlled  Password  Recognition  system  using  MEMS 
accelerometer is implemented using embedded  microcontroller.  The accelerometer is a sensor  which produces 
the electrical signal as per the movement. The proposed method uses the keypad to enter the password. Initially 
they have to set the position in accelerometer which is connected with the controller, so the controller gets the 
input  analog  signal  and  produces  the  respective  ADC  samples.  When  the  controller  realizes  that  the  ADC 
samples are matched with the predetermined value in a controller, it will wait until we enter the password. If the 
entered password is matched, it will send the random password to the user mobile through the GSM technology 
and then the  user enter the random password through  the  keypad interface.  If the entered random password is 
checked, it will transmit the control signal to the driving circuit [3]. 

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  conception  of  entire  systems  consisted  of  two  sections  which  are  hardware  and  software.  The 
hardware  is  designed  by  the  rules  of  embedded  system,  and  the  steps  of  software  platform  based  on  the 
programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  
 
The more details are presented as sticks with. 
A.  Hardware Design:  

The LQFP64 chip is used as the core of entire hardware. Furthermore, the models of LCD, keyboard, alarm, 

Accelerometer sensor, GSM connect to the main chip (LQFP64).   
On that point are some modules consisted of the system as follows: 
  RFID Fundamentals:  

Essentially, an RFID system consists of an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a transponder 
(RF tag) electronically programmed  with  unique data. There are  many different types of RFID systems in  the 
market. These are categorized on the base of their frequency ranges. Some of the  most commonly  used RFID 
kits  are  low-frequency  (30-500  kc),  mid-frequency  (900  kHz-1500MHz)  and  high-frequency  (2.4-2.5GHz). 
Essentially, an RFID system consists of three components: an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a 
transponder  (RF  tag)  electronically  programmed  with  unique  data.  An  RFID  reader  is  a  device  that  is  used  to 
interrogate an RFID tag. The reader has an antenna that emits radio waves; the tag responds by sending back its 
data. An RFID tag is a microchip combined with an antenna in a compact package; the packaging is structured 
to  allow  the  RFID  tag  to  be  bonded  to  an  object  to  be  covered.  "RFID"  stands  for  Radio  Frequency 
Identification. The tag's antenna picks up  signals  from an  RFID reader or scanner and then returns the signal, 
usually with some additional data (like a unique serial number or other customized information). A passive tag 
is an RFID tag that does not contain a battery; the power is supplied by the reader. When radio waves from the 
reader are encountered by a passive RFID tag, the coiled antenna within the tag forms a magnetic field. The tag 
draws  power  from  it,  energizing  the  circuits  in  the  tag.  The  tag  then  transmits  the  data  encoded  in  the  tag's 
memory. The RX and TX pins of an RFID reader connected to the TX and Rx pins of ARM7 Microcontroller 
respectively. And so the reader senses the data from the Tag and transmits the sensed data to the microcontroller 
via serial port [2].

Design Of Banking Security… 

  MEMS Sensor: 

Micro  electro  mechanical  systems  or  MEMS  are  integrated  micro  devices  or  systems  combining 
electrical  and  mechanical  components.  They  are  fabricated  using  Integrated  Circuit  (IC)  batch  processing 
techniques and can range in size from microns to millimeters. These systems can sense control and motivate on 
the micro scale and function individually or in arrays to generate effects on the micro plate. “The area of MEMS 
is based on the use of IC fabrication techniques to create devices capable of working as mechanical, electrical, 
and chemical transducers for applications in fields such as automotive and medical industries.” It can be hard for 
one to imagine the size of MEMS devices. The general size of MEMS is on the order of microns (10 powers -6 
m). The primary characteristic of MEMS is their diminished size. Due to their size, MEMS cannot be viewed 
with the unaided eye. An optical microscope is usually required for one to be able to see them. 

 
The ADXL330 is a modest, slender, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned 
voltage outputs. The product measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of ±3 g. It can evaluate the 
static acceleration of gravity in tilt sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, 
jar, or vibration [3]. 

 

  GSM:  This  GSM  modem  is  an  extremely  flexible  plug  and  play  quad  band  GSM  modem  for  direct  and 
easy integration to RS232. Supports features like Voice, Data/Fax, SMS, GPRS and integrated TCP/IP stack [5]. 
 
B. Software Design:  

The embedded platform discussed above is programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  

Keil μVision4: The LPC2148 is programmed with KeilμVision4. It is a Windows-based software program that 
combines a robust and modern editor with a project manager and make facility tool for growth. It integrates all 
the tools to develop embedded applications including a C/C++ compiler, macro assembler, linker/locator, and a 
HEX file generator. μVision helps expedite the growth process of embedded applications by providing  the IDE 
(Integrated Development Environment). KEIL is used to create the source files; automatically compile, link and 
covert  using  options  set  with  an  easy  to  use  user  interface  and  finally  simulate  or  perform  debugging  on  the 
hardware with access to C variables and computer storage. Unless we have to use the tolls along the command 
line,  the  choice  is  open.  This  IDE,  i.e.  KEIL  Greatly  simplifies  the  procedure  of  producing  and  testing  an 
embedded application. The user of KEIL centers on projects. A project is a list of all the source files needed to 
construct a exclusive application, all the tool options which define exactly how to make the application, and if 
required how the application should be imitated. A task is exactly the binary code required for the application. 
Because  of  the  high  level  of  flexibility  required  from  the  tools,  there  are  many  choices  that  can  be  set  to 
configure  the  tools  to  maneuver  in  a  specific  and  desired  way.  It  would  be  very  tedious  to  have  to  set  these 
options  up  every  time  the  application  is  being  built;  therefore  they  are  stored  in  a  project  file.  Loading  the 
project file into KEIL informs KEIL which source files are involved, where they are, and how to configure the 
tools in the right manner. KEIL can then execute each tool with the correct options. Source files are added to the 
project and the tool options are set as required [5].

PROPOSED SYSTEM 

 

The  purported  plan  is  drawn  up  of  hardware  and  software  tools,  the  hardware  used  are  RFID  tag&  reader, 
MEMS sensor, LCD, GSM module, all is interfacing with the help of ARM7 and the software is designated by 
the  Keil  μVison  software.We  offered  the  idea  using  RFID  &  MEMS  technology  along  with  GSM  modem  for 
authentication of clients. When an authorized person comes to the door which consists of RFID tags, the person 
has to insert the ID card in predefine space. The card contains a unique barcode number which is the identity of 
an  authorized  person.  As  soon  as  a  person  inserts  the  card,  the  system  will  ask  for  the  sensing  the  motion; 
MEMS  accelerometer  can  sense  motion  in  3  axes  (X,  Y  and  Z).  Initially  we  have  to  specify  the  position  in 
accelerometer which is united with the controller, and then the controller receives the input analogue signal and 
brings  forth  the  respective  ADC  samples.  When  the  controller  sees  that  the  ADC  samples  are  paired  with  the 
predetermined value in a controlled. If the motion will not detect by the system within  the predetermined time 
instantly  message  will  forward  to  higher  authority  and  the  nearest  police  station.  If  the  system  will  detect  the 
motion,  it  will  ask  for  password  again  if  the  user  will  not  press  correct password,  a  message,  will  send  to  the 
higher authority through the GSM technology and then the user enters the random password through the keypad 
interface.  If  the  entered  random  password  is  matched,  it  will  send  the  command  signal  to  the  driving  circuit. 
Driving circuit receives the command and forwards the signal to unlock the doorway.

INTRODUCTION 

In  the  21st  century  people  are  concerned  about  their  safety,  for  their  valuable  things.  Old  concepts  and 
devices  are  getting  modified  as  per  requirement  of  people.  In  day  to  day  life  we  need  to  seek  new  security 
arrangement.  Thus  we  evolve  to  provide  the  maximum  level  security  scheme.  In  this  present  age,  safety  was 
becoming an all important event for most of the masses, especially in the rural and urban regions. Some people 
will try to cheat or steal the property which may endanger the safety of money in the bank, house, and office. To 
defeat the security threat, a most of people will install a bunch of locks or alarm system. There are many types 
of alarm systems available in the market, which utilizes different types of sensor. The sensor can detect different 
types of changes occur in the surrounding and the changes will be processed to be given out an alert according 
to the pre-set value. By the same time this scheme may not be beneficial for all the time. Sensing elements are 
small  hardware  devices  similar  in  flavor  to  RFID  tags.  While  RFID  tags  emit  identifiers,  sensors  emit 
information about their environments, like ambient temperature or humidity. Sensors typically contain batteries, 
and  are  thus  larger  and  more  expensive  than  passive  RFID  tags.  Between  active  RFID  tags  and  sensors, 
however,  there  is  little  difference  but  nomenclature.  For  example,  some  commercially  available  active  RFID 
devices are designed to secure port containers. They emit identifiers, but also sense whether or not a container 
has  been  opened.  Given  such  examples,  there  is  surprisingly  little  overlap  between  the  literature  on  sensor 
security  and  that  on  RFID  security.  The  boundaries  between  wireless-device  types  will  inevitably  blur,  as 
evidenced by the dual role of reader and tag played by NFC devices. Using machine motion techniques, in our 
approach logical patterns are obtained from physical sensor attached to the system [1].

EXISTING SCENARIOS 

Especially  all  Indian  banks  use  the  old  security  system  as  compared  to  international  banks,  they  are 
applying a mechanical arrangement to protect the lockers with the aid of two keys all, out of which one is for 
authorized person and another is with bank authority. When both keys are placed simultaneously the locker can 
be  operated  but  sudden  failure  in  the  gears  of  the  system  or  loss  of  keys  occurs,  then  user  has  to  face  many 
difficult situations in this addition this system is time consuming also. Enormously growing banking technology 
has  altered  the  way  banking  activities  are  treated  with.  Security  measures  at  banks  can  play  a  critical, 
contributory  role  in  preventing  attacks  on  customers.  These  standards  are  of  paramount  importance  when

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Shweta  J  Suggest  that  earlier  security  for  Bank  system  is  not  very  much  efficient.  Banks  provide  a 
locker system for their customers for  safe keeping. In the current locker system, there is no separate banker to 
bring  maintenance  and  pay  heed  to  people  wishing  to  access  lockers.  Her  project  aims  to  change  the  existing 
system  and  automate  the  locker  system  using  RFID  tags  for  customer  identification.  Every  client  is  granted  a 
unique RFID card with a unique number so that the customer can be identified and access can be allotted to the 
customer‟s locker [4].R Ramani & P. Niranjan et al. Expresses his view like that  is to design and implement a 
bank    locker  security  system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology  which  can  be  organized  in  banks,  secured 
offices and homes. In this system merely an authentic person can be recovered money from bank  locker. They 
have  carried  out  a  bank  locker  security  system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology  containing  door  locking 
system  using  RFID  and  GSM,  which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validates  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in 
real  time  for  bank  locker  secure  access.  It  is  a  low  cost,  low  in  power  conception,  compact  in  size  and  stand 
alone system. The microcontroller compares the passwords entered by keyboard and received through  a mobile 
phone [2]. 

 
K  Chandrasekar  et  al.  They  propose  Motion  Controlled  Password  Recognition  system  using  MEMS 
accelerometer is implemented using embedded  microcontroller.  The accelerometer is a sensor  which produces 
the electrical signal as per the movement. The proposed method uses the keypad to enter the password. Initially 
they have to set the position in accelerometer which is connected with the controller, so the controller gets the 
input  analog  signal  and  produces  the  respective  ADC  samples.  When  the  controller  realizes  that  the  ADC 
samples are matched with the predetermined value in a controller, it will wait until we enter the password. If the 
entered password is matched, it will send the random password to the user mobile through the GSM technology 
and then the  user enter the random password through  the  keypad interface.  If the entered random password is 
checked, it will transmit the control signal to the driving circuit [3]. 

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  conception  of  entire  systems  consisted  of  two  sections  which  are  hardware  and  software.  The 
hardware  is  designed  by  the  rules  of  embedded  system,  and  the  steps  of  software  platform  based  on  the 
programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  
 
The more details are presented as sticks with. 
A.  Hardware Design:  

The LQFP64 chip is used as the core of entire hardware. Furthermore, the models of LCD, keyboard, alarm, 

Accelerometer sensor, GSM connect to the main chip (LQFP64).   
On that point are some modules consisted of the system as follows: 
  RFID Fundamentals:  

Essentially, an RFID system consists of an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a transponder 
(RF tag) electronically programmed  with  unique data. There are  many different types of RFID systems in  the 
market. These are categorized on the base of their frequency ranges. Some of the  most commonly  used RFID 
kits  are  low-frequency  (30-500  kc),  mid-frequency  (900  kHz-1500MHz)  and  high-frequency  (2.4-2.5GHz). 
Essentially, an RFID system consists of three components: an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a 
transponder  (RF  tag)  electronically  programmed  with  unique  data.  An  RFID  reader  is  a  device  that  is  used  to 
interrogate an RFID tag. The reader has an antenna that emits radio waves; the tag responds by sending back its 
data. An RFID tag is a microchip combined with an antenna in a compact package; the packaging is structured 
to  allow  the  RFID  tag  to  be  bonded  to  an  object  to  be  covered.  "RFID"  stands  for  Radio  Frequency 
Identification. The tag's antenna picks up  signals  from an  RFID reader or scanner and then returns the signal, 
usually with some additional data (like a unique serial number or other customized information). A passive tag 
is an RFID tag that does not contain a battery; the power is supplied by the reader. When radio waves from the 
reader are encountered by a passive RFID tag, the coiled antenna within the tag forms a magnetic field. The tag 
draws  power  from  it,  energizing  the  circuits  in  the  tag.  The  tag  then  transmits  the  data  encoded  in  the  tag's 
memory. The RX and TX pins of an RFID reader connected to the TX and Rx pins of ARM7 Microcontroller 
respectively. And so the reader senses the data from the Tag and transmits the sensed data to the microcontroller 
via serial port [2].

Design Of Banking Security… 

  MEMS Sensor: 

Micro  electro  mechanical  systems  or  MEMS  are  integrated  micro  devices  or  systems  combining 
electrical  and  mechanical  components.  They  are  fabricated  using  Integrated  Circuit  (IC)  batch  processing 
techniques and can range in size from microns to millimeters. These systems can sense control and motivate on 
the micro scale and function individually or in arrays to generate effects on the micro plate. “The area of MEMS 
is based on the use of IC fabrication techniques to create devices capable of working as mechanical, electrical, 
and chemical transducers for applications in fields such as automotive and medical industries.” It can be hard for 
one to imagine the size of MEMS devices. The general size of MEMS is on the order of microns (10 powers -6 
m). The primary characteristic of MEMS is their diminished size. Due to their size, MEMS cannot be viewed 
with the unaided eye. An optical microscope is usually required for one to be able to see them. 

 
The ADXL330 is a modest, slender, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned 
voltage outputs. The product measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of ±3 g. It can evaluate the 
static acceleration of gravity in tilt sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, 
jar, or vibration [3]. 

 

  GSM:  This  GSM  modem  is  an  extremely  flexible  plug  and  play  quad  band  GSM  modem  for  direct  and 
easy integration to RS232. Supports features like Voice, Data/Fax, SMS, GPRS and integrated TCP/IP stack [5]. 
 
B. Software Design:  

The embedded platform discussed above is programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  

Keil μVision4: The LPC2148 is programmed with KeilμVision4. It is a Windows-based software program that 
combines a robust and modern editor with a project manager and make facility tool for growth. It integrates all 
the tools to develop embedded applications including a C/C++ compiler, macro assembler, linker/locator, and a 
HEX file generator. μVision helps expedite the growth process of embedded applications by providing  the IDE 
(Integrated Development Environment). KEIL is used to create the source files; automatically compile, link and 
covert  using  options  set  with  an  easy  to  use  user  interface  and  finally  simulate  or  perform  debugging  on  the 
hardware with access to C variables and computer storage. Unless we have to use the tolls along the command 
line,  the  choice  is  open.  This  IDE,  i.e.  KEIL  Greatly  simplifies  the  procedure  of  producing  and  testing  an 
embedded application. The user of KEIL centers on projects. A project is a list of all the source files needed to 
construct a exclusive application, all the tool options which define exactly how to make the application, and if 
required how the application should be imitated. A task is exactly the binary code required for the application. 
Because  of  the  high  level  of  flexibility  required  from  the  tools,  there  are  many  choices  that  can  be  set  to 
configure  the  tools  to  maneuver  in  a  specific  and  desired  way.  It  would  be  very  tedious  to  have  to  set  these 
options  up  every  time  the  application  is  being  built;  therefore  they  are  stored  in  a  project  file.  Loading  the 
project file into KEIL informs KEIL which source files are involved, where they are, and how to configure the 
tools in the right manner. KEIL can then execute each tool with the correct options. Source files are added to the 
project and the tool options are set as required [5].

The user can put a predetermined password by a defined set of motions as decided by them. Once the 
Microcontroller  senses  any  motion,  system  is  asking  for  a  password.  If  any  one  person  presses  the  wrong 
password, then system will be blocked.  The individual will get three opportunities to enter the right password. 
If  he  enters  the  correct  password,  then  the  door  of  the  locker  will  get  opened,  otherwise  the  main  door  will 
remain closed and buzzer will start as an indication of an unauthorized individual is attempting  to enroll into a 
banking way. If any thief is standing behind user or authorized individual with any weapon at the time of user 
collect the hard currency/document. In this situation we have provided a switch which is placed exactly foot of 
the  authenticate  person.  When  user  will  press  foot  switch  the  system  will  blocked  and  display  will  shows 
„system  error‟  message  simultaneously  at  the  same  time  within  10seconds  the  door  will  be  closed  as  well  as 
buzzer GSM is used for sending a message to higher authorities when RFID READER, MEMS accelerometer 
sensor  &  password  provided  by  bank  will  not  detect.  These  technologies  are  a  safe  way  of  authentication 
because data of both technologies are unique, cannot be shared, and cannot be missed.  Our project secures the 
money, valuable documents along with minimum risk factor.

system  using  RFID  and  GSM,  which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validates  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in 
real  time  for  bank  locker  secure  access.  It  is  a  low  cost,  low  in  power  conception,  compact  in  size  and  stand 
alone system. The microcontroller compares the passwords entered by keyboard and received through  a mobile 
phone [2]. 

 
K  Chandrasekar  et  al.  They  propose  Motion  Controlled  Password  Recognition  system  using  MEMS 
accelerometer is implemented using embedded  microcontroller.  The accelerometer is a sensor  which produces 
the electrical signal as per the movement. The proposed method uses the keypad to enter the password. Initially 
they have to set the position in accelerometer which is connected with the controller, so the controller gets the 
input  analog  signal  and  produces  the  respective  ADC  samples.  When  the  controller  realizes  that  the  ADC 
samples are matched with the predetermined value in a controller, it will wait until we enter the password. If the 
entered password is matched, it will send the random password to the user mobile through the GSM technology 
and then the  user enter the random password through  the  keypad interface.  If the entered random password is 
checked, it will transmit the control signal to the driving circuit [3]. 

 

IV.  METHODOLOGY 

The  conception  of  entire  systems  consisted  of  two  sections  which  are  hardware  and  software.  The 
hardware  is  designed  by  the  rules  of  embedded  system,  and  the  steps  of  software  platform  based  on  the 
programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  
 
The more details are presented as sticks with. 
A.  Hardware Design:  

The LQFP64 chip is used as the core of entire hardware. Furthermore, the models of LCD, keyboard, alarm, 

Accelerometer sensor, GSM connect to the main chip (LQFP64).   
On that point are some modules consisted of the system as follows: 
  RFID Fundamentals:  

Essentially, an RFID system consists of an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a transponder 
(RF tag) electronically programmed  with  unique data. There are  many different types of RFID systems in  the 
market. These are categorized on the base of their frequency ranges. Some of the  most commonly  used RFID 
kits  are  low-frequency  (30-500  kc),  mid-frequency  (900  kHz-1500MHz)  and  high-frequency  (2.4-2.5GHz). 
Essentially, an RFID system consists of three components: an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder) and a 
transponder  (RF  tag)  electronically  programmed  with  unique  data.  An  RFID  reader  is  a  device  that  is  used  to 
interrogate an RFID tag. The reader has an antenna that emits radio waves; the tag responds by sending back its 
data. An RFID tag is a microchip combined with an antenna in a compact package; the packaging is structured 
to  allow  the  RFID  tag  to  be  bonded  to  an  object  to  be  covered.  "RFID"  stands  for  Radio  Frequency 
Identification. The tag's antenna picks up  signals  from an  RFID reader or scanner and then returns the signal, 
usually with some additional data (like a unique serial number or other customized information). A passive tag 
is an RFID tag that does not contain a battery; the power is supplied by the reader. When radio waves from the 
reader are encountered by a passive RFID tag, the coiled antenna within the tag forms a magnetic field. The tag 
draws  power  from  it,  energizing  the  circuits  in  the  tag.  The  tag  then  transmits  the  data  encoded  in  the  tag's 
memory. The RX and TX pins of an RFID reader connected to the TX and Rx pins of ARM7 Microcontroller 
respectively. And so the reader senses the data from the Tag and transmits the sensed data to the microcontroller 
via serial port [2].

  MEMS Sensor: 

Micro  electro  mechanical  systems  or  MEMS  are  integrated  micro  devices  or  systems  combining 
electrical  and  mechanical  components.  They  are  fabricated  using  Integrated  Circuit  (IC)  batch  processing 
techniques and can range in size from microns to millimeters. These systems can sense control and motivate on 
the micro scale and function individually or in arrays to generate effects on the micro plate. “The area of MEMS 
is based on the use of IC fabrication techniques to create devices capable of working as mechanical, electrical, 
and chemical transducers for applications in fields such as automotive and medical industries.” It can be hard for 
one to imagine the size of MEMS devices. The general size of MEMS is on the order of microns (10 powers -6 
m). The primary characteristic of MEMS is their diminished size. Due to their size, MEMS cannot be viewed 
with the unaided eye. An optical microscope is usually required for one to be able to see them. 

 
The ADXL330 is a modest, slender, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned 
voltage outputs. The product measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of ±3 g. It can evaluate the 
static acceleration of gravity in tilt sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, 
jar, or vibration [3]. 

 

  GSM:  This  GSM  modem  is  an  extremely  flexible  plug  and  play  quad  band  GSM  modem  for  direct  and 
easy integration to RS232. Supports features like Voice, Data/Fax, SMS, GPRS and integrated TCP/IP stack [5]. 
 
B. Software Design:  

The embedded platform discussed above is programmed in C language with KeilμVision4.  

Keil μVision4: The LPC2148 is programmed with KeilμVision4. It is a Windows-based software program that 
combines a robust and modern editor with a project manager and make facility tool for growth. It integrates all 
the tools to develop embedded applications including a C/C++ compiler, macro assembler, linker/locator, and a 
HEX file generator. μVision helps expedite the growth process of embedded applications by providing  the IDE 
(Integrated Development Environment). KEIL is used to create the source files; automatically compile, link and 
covert  using  options  set  with  an  easy  to  use  user  interface  and  finally  simulate  or  perform  debugging  on  the 
hardware with access to C variables and computer storage. Unless we have to use the tolls along the command 
line,  the  choice  is  open.  This  IDE,  i.e.  KEIL  Greatly  simplifies  the  procedure  of  producing  and  testing  an 
embedded application. The user of KEIL centers on projects. A project is a list of all the source files needed to 
construct a exclusive application, all the tool options which define exactly how to make the application, and if 
required how the application should be imitated. A task is exactly the binary code required for the application. 
Because  of  the  high  level  of  flexibility  required  from  the  tools,  there  are  many  choices  that  can  be  set  to 
configure  the  tools  to  maneuver  in  a  specific  and  desired  way.  It  would  be  very  tedious  to  have  to  set  these 
options  up  every  time  the  application  is  being  built;  therefore  they  are  stored  in  a  project  file.  Loading  the 
project file into KEIL informs KEIL which source files are involved, where they are, and how to configure the 
tools in the right manner. KEIL can then execute each tool with the correct options. Source files are added to the 
project and the tool options are set as required [5].

PROPOSED SYSTEM 

 

The  purported  plan  is  drawn  up  of  hardware  and  software  tools,  the  hardware  used  are  RFID  tag&  reader, 
MEMS sensor, LCD, GSM module, all is interfacing with the help of ARM7 and the software is designated by 
the  Keil  μVison  software.We  offered  the  idea  using  RFID  &  MEMS  technology  along  with  GSM  modem  for 
authentication of clients. When an authorized person comes to the door which consists of RFID tags, the person 
has to insert the ID card in predefine space. The card contains a unique barcode number which is the identity of 
an  authorized  person.  As  soon  as  a  person  inserts  the  card,  the  system  will  ask  for  the  sensing  the  motion; 
MEMS  accelerometer  can  sense  motion  in  3  axes  (X,  Y  and  Z).  Initially  we  have  to  specify  the  position  in 
accelerometer which is united with the controller, and then the controller receives the input analogue signal and 
brings  forth  the  respective  ADC  samples.  When  the  controller  sees  that  the  ADC  samples  are  paired  with  the 
predetermined value in a controlled. If the motion will not detect by the system within  the predetermined time 
instantly  message  will  forward  to  higher  authority  and  the  nearest  police  station.  If  the  system  will  detect  the 
motion,  it  will  ask  for  password  again  if  the  user  will  not  press  correct password,  a  message,  will  send  to  the 
higher authority through the GSM technology and then the user enters the random password through the keypad 
interface.  If  the  entered  random  password  is  matched,  it  will  send  the  command  signal  to  the  driving  circuit. 
Driving circuit receives the command and forwards the signal to unlock the doorway.

The user can put a predetermined password by a defined set of motions as decided by them. Once the 
Microcontroller  senses  any  motion,  system  is  asking  for  a  password.  If  any  one  person  presses  the  wrong 
password, then system will be blocked.  The individual will get three opportunities to enter the right password. 
If  he  enters  the  correct  password,  then  the  door  of  the  locker  will  get  opened,  otherwise  the  main  door  will 
remain closed and buzzer will start as an indication of an unauthorized individual is attempting  to enroll into a 
banking way. If any thief is standing behind user or authorized individual with any weapon at the time of user 
collect the hard currency/document. In this situation we have provided a switch which is placed exactly foot of 
the  authenticate  person.  When  user  will  press  foot  switch  the  system  will  blocked  and  display  will  shows 
„system  error‟  message  simultaneously  at  the  same  time  within  10seconds  the  door  will  be  closed  as  well  as 
buzzer GSM is used for sending a message to higher authorities when RFID READER, MEMS accelerometer 
sensor  &  password  provided  by  bank  will  not  detect.  These  technologies  are  a  safe  way  of  authentication 
because data of both technologies are unique, cannot be shared, and cannot be missed.  Our project secures the 
money, valuable documents along with minimum risk factor.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

From review of various papers, I conclude that the growth in the electronic transaction scheme has resulted 
in a greater demand for accurate & fast user identification and authentication.  The system consist of RFID tag 
and reader after scanning the tag the both doors will be open at 2000 milliseconds and practically time is taken 
by the door is 3000 milliseconds, then user will get three chances of inserting the right password with a wait of 
1000  milliseconds,  after  completing  the  cognitive  operation  of  dealing  the  first  door  will  open  at  2000 
milliseconds  then  second  door  will  open  at  3000  milliseconds  practically.  We  also  included  GSM  modem  for 
sending the text  message to the user and the bank authorities, The Response time of GSM  modem to transmit 
the message to user and authorities is 1000 milliseconds and the total time is consumed by the GSM modem to 
transmit  the  message  [Practically]  5000  milliseconds.  So  we  have  found  that  with  the  help  of  Experimental 
result is in real time system intends to get delayed by fractions of moments. The accelerometer is a sensor which 
produces the electrical signal as per the movement.The Implementation of Banking security by utilizing RFID 
and  MEMS  Technology  with  GSM  Modem  took  advantage  of  the  constancy  and  reliability.  The  security 
features were enhanced largely for the reliability and stability of owner recognition. The whole organization was 
built on the technology of embedded system which clears the system more secure, reliable and comfortable to 
apply.
