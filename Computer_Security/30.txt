security  is  the  state  of  the  most  effective  utilization  of
corporate  resources  to  prevent  any  threat  and  to  assure
stable functioning  of  enterprises  at  present  time  and  in
future [6]. The state of any business structure is affected
by the factors, which originate from external and internal
environment of any enterprise. The external environment
generates  negative  consequences  (external 
threats),
which  appear  without  participation  or  against  will  of
enterprise or its personnel [7]. Moreover, no manager is
able  to  affect  directly  this  group  of  factors  using  the
economic knowledge and practical skills in order to adapt
to the current situation and minimize likely consequences
when they emerge. 

When considering the effect of environment on the
enterprise (macroenvironment), the manager should realize
that any  enterprise  exists  in  close  integrity  the  external
environment, which plays a huge role in its business. The
enterprise obtains raw stock, energy, information, human
and other resourses from the external environment when
carrying  its  economic  business,  it  transforms  them  into
products  or  services  and  passes 
the  external
environment,  in  other  words,  it  continuously  maintains
exchanges with external environment in order to assure its
own existence and further progress.

The external environment of any production system

(microenvironment)  may  create  certain  negative  effects
with  are  mainly  due  to  the  ineffective  operation  of  the
enterprise  in  general,  its  structural  subdivisions  or
individual  employees.  Because  the  organization  is  the
system created directly by the people, its internal changes
of definite position result from the managerial decisions.
However,  it  does  not  mean  that  all  internal  changes
without  exception  can  be 
supervised  by
management. The enterprise internal environment directly
affects its functioning.

fully 

The study by management of a certain environment
as well  as  external  environment  should  be  aimed  at
revealing all possible threats which they may originate. It
should be revealed first what strong and weak points the
production  structure  possesses.  The  strong  points  serve
as  a  basis  for  the  manager  to  rely  upon  in  competition
struggle  environment,  which  should  constantly  expand
and  reinforced.   Management  should  attentively  watch

after the condition of weak points in order to respond in
time in case they emerge [12,16].

It  follows  that  elaboration  of  the  strategy  of
assurance of economic security of any business structure
should  logically  begin  with  the  analysis  of  external
factors. Exactly the external factors are beyond control of
management,  they  are  independent  of  the  economic
subject  activity  and they can  gravely affect the strategy
of  acting  economic  subject.  The  main  task  of  external
analysis is to reveal opportunities and threats, which may
emerge  at  present  and  in  future  and  to  determine  the
strategic alternatives.

Some  economic  publications  attribute  the  notion
threat  to the notion risk . Remembering the intricacy of
dividing  between  the  notions  in  the  existing  economic
situation, let us assume that the notion  threat  unlike that
of risk , in the first place, implies the probability of their
emergence. Risk is probability of damage, while threat is
a large extent of damage probability. From the viewpoint
of  risk  manifestation,  any  business  activity  risks
permanently, while threat appears periodically. From the
above  we  assume  that  these  two  notions  should  not  be
integrated for hundred percent.

In the  period  of  economic  globalization, 

When identifying the threats to enterprise economic
security, it should be born in mind that the characteristic
of state of one and the same business system depends on
its desirable future: if, for instance, the enterprise strives
just survive in competition, the loss of sale scope may be
considered quite safe; if the aim is to expand the market
niche,  this  loss  represents  a  clear  threat  and  the
company’s state is fully devoid of the security property.
the
enterprise  mega  environment  should  also 
identify,
because  there  is  a  potential  threat  that  a  drastic  rise  of
import may affect the business functioning. It is because
too  fast  following  the  economic  globalization  models
without taking into account own rather short experience
of modern market relations is fraud of the danger of high
cost. Therefore,  measures 
should  be  undertaken
beforehand to  weaken  possible  threat  originated  by  the
external environment [17,18,19] (megaenvironment).

The main threat to the economic security of Russian
business when joining the world trade organization is the
openness of Russian market to imports. This circumstance
may lead to closure of many Russian businesses due to
their poor  profitability.  It  relates  to  the  branches
characterized  with  unsatisfactory  financial  indicators,
unstable progress and negative opportunities to penetrate
into the foreign market. The drop of production in many
branches will spur the redundancy as a social problem [2].

When studying the factors originated by external and
internal threats, the functional components of economic
security should be identified in order to determine in time
the  impending  threats,  possible  negative  consequences
and their effect in order to wisely and effectively minimize
them or fully eliminate. Doctor of economy professor L.P.
Goncharenko
intellectual,
recruiting, political legal, ecological, information, power
components  are  related  here  [8].  Each  of  the  above
functional components of enterprise economic security is
characterized by own content, a set of functional criteria
and ways of implementation. Each manger should know
the  comprehensive  approach  to  assuring  on  business
economic  scurrility  taking  into  account  the  features  of
functioning of its components, because if any component
of the system fails, it would mean the economic subject
state far from safe.

Recently,  many  managers  are  setting  up  special
subdivisions responsible  for  economic  security  of  their
economic  subjects.  It  proves  a  huge  theoretical  and
practical challenge of the problem in question. However,
these  services 
lack  a  developed  and  efficiently
functioning system  of  rating  and  assuring  enterprise
economic security, nor any theoretical base for their own
activity  impairing  their  functioning.  The  economic
security  is  assured  by  this  service  ineffectively  because
they ignore the entire combination of emerging threats not
do  they  apply  the  system  approach 
to  functional
components. As  a  rule,  the  enterprise  management  is
busy with providing separate elements (for instance, only
power,  or  only  information,  or  two-three  components),
rather than the economic security in general.

We  have  studied  a  number  of  enterprises  of  mat
packing industry in the Russian Federation. The analysis
has  revealed that  the economic security  serves  at  many
enterprises deals  with  installation  of  video  cams  and
bugging devices  at  various  structural  subdivisions  in
order to prevent theft and other negative effects both on
the part of personnel and outsiders. It means that only the
power component  is  assured  rather  than  the  whole
economic security system.

As regards other economic subjects in question, their
economic security service, in addition to the same actions,
deals also  with  the  so-called special  checks   of  their
employees during recruiting (court sentences record from
previous  places  of  employment,  study  and  other
records).in  other  words,  both  force  and  recruiting
components  are  fulfilled  at  these  economic  subjects;  it
cannot  be  considered  the  comprehensive  effectively
functioning economic security system of the whole  active
enterprise.

The study of the third group of Russian enterprises
has revealed that, in addition to the power component, the
economic  security  service  closely  interacts  with  the
planning  economic  service,  in  other  words,  it  fulfils a
complex  of  work  to  ensure  high  level  of  enterprise
solvency  and  liquidity  of  securities,  the  most  effective
capital structure, maximization of profit and promotion of
business profitability, et cetera. In other words, the power
and financial components are assured at this enterprise to
enjoy the full economic security system.

The  accomplished  study  shows  that  the  economic
security of Russian enterprises is run without system. The
functional  components  should  be  tied  to  business
strategies and ensure fulfillment of enterprise marketing
strategy. The harmonization of all elaborated strategies is
the  necessary  condition  of  enterprise  efficient  activity.
The  harmonious  is  only  the  system  with  balanced
components.  At 
industrial  enterprise,
harmonization of such strategies as  trade and industrial
policy  are  particularly  challenging.  Namely  this  factor
favors  reinforcement  of  enterprise  economic  security,
particularly  when  Russia  enters  into  the  world  trade
organization,  because  the  world  economy  globalization
compels  enterprises  to  penetrate  into  the  international
area.

CONCLUSIONS

From   the   above   the   economic   security  system
of  industrial  enterprise  can  be  determined  as  the
coordination  of  functional  aims  and  methods  of  its
achievement to ensure the production process and supply
to the end consumer characterized by integral aims of all

economy  of  many  states  faces  grave  "challenges"  of
globalization  and  the  need  of  closer  and  more  efficient

effective  integration  is  possible  only  by  creating  stable
and strong internal economy relying on all range of levers
of contemporary economic policy [2].

The economic security state of any country depends
directly on how the security problems are solved at the
level of an individual company where the strategic aims
are implemented in particular [5]. In general, the economic

security  is  the  state  of  the  most  effective  utilization  of
corporate  resources  to  prevent  any  threat  and  to  assure
stable functioning  of  enterprises  at  present  time  and  in
future [6]. The state of any business structure is affected
by the factors, which originate from external and internal
environment of any enterprise. The external environment
generates  negative  consequences  (external 
threats),
which  appear  without  participation  or  against  will  of
enterprise or its personnel [7]. Moreover, no manager is
able  to  affect  directly  this  group  of  factors  using  the
economic knowledge and practical skills in order to adapt
to the current situation and minimize likely consequences
when they emerge. 

When considering the effect of environment on the
enterprise (macroenvironment), the manager should realize
that any  enterprise  exists  in  close  integrity  the  external
environment, which plays a huge role in its business. The
enterprise obtains raw stock, energy, information, human
and other resourses from the external environment when
carrying  its  economic  business,  it  transforms  them  into
products  or  services  and  passes 
the  external
environment,  in  other  words,  it  continuously  maintains
exchanges with external environment in order to assure its
own existence and further progress.

with  are  mainly  due  to  the  ineffective  operation  of  the

system created directly by the people, its internal changes

However,  it  does  not  mean  that  all  internal  changes

The study by management of a certain environment
as well  as  external  environment  should  be  aimed  at
revealing all possible threats which they may originate. It
should be revealed first what strong and weak points the
production  structure  possesses.  The  strong  points  serve
as  a  basis  for  the  manager  to  rely  upon  in  competition
struggle  environment,  which  should  constantly  expand
and  reinforced.   Management  should  attentively  watch

after the condition of weak points in order to respond in
time in case they emerge [12,16].

It  follows  that  elaboration  of  the  strategy  of
assurance of economic security of any business structure
should  logically  begin  with  the  analysis  of  external
factors. Exactly the external factors are beyond control of
management,  they  are  independent  of  the  economic
subject  activity  and they can  gravely affect the strategy
of  acting  economic  subject.  The  main  task  of  external
analysis is to reveal opportunities and threats, which may
emerge  at  present  and  in  future  and  to  determine  the
strategic alternatives.

Some  economic  publications  attribute  the  notion
threat  to the notion risk . Remembering the intricacy of
dividing  between  the  notions  in  the  existing  economic
situation, let us assume that the notion  threat  unlike that
of risk , in the first place, implies the probability of their
emergence. Risk is probability of damage, while threat is
a large extent of damage probability. From the viewpoint
of  risk  manifestation,  any  business  activity  risks
permanently, while threat appears periodically. From the
above  we  assume  that  these  two  notions  should  not  be
integrated for hundred percent.

In the  period  of  economic  globalization, 

When identifying the threats to enterprise economic
security, it should be born in mind that the characteristic
of state of one and the same business system depends on
its desirable future: if, for instance, the enterprise strives
just survive in competition, the loss of sale scope may be
considered quite safe; if the aim is to expand the market
niche,  this  loss  represents  a  clear  threat  and  the
company’s state is fully devoid of the security property.
the
enterprise  mega  environment  should  also 
identify,
because  there  is  a  potential  threat  that  a  drastic  rise  of
import may affect the business functioning. It is because
too  fast  following  the  economic  globalization  models
without taking into account own rather short experience
of modern market relations is fraud of the danger of high
cost. Therefore,  measures 
should  be  undertaken
beforehand to  weaken  possible  threat  originated  by  the
external environment [17,18,19] (megaenvironment).

The main threat to the economic security of Russian
business when joining the world trade organization is the
openness of Russian market to imports. This circumstance
may lead to closure of many Russian businesses due to
their poor  profitability.  It  relates  to  the  branches
characterized  with  unsatisfactory  financial  indicators,
unstable progress and negative opportunities to penetrate
into the foreign market. The drop of production in many
branches will spur the redundancy as a social problem [2].

When studying the factors originated by external and
internal threats, the functional components of economic
security should be identified in order to determine in time
the  impending  threats,  possible  negative  consequences
and their effect in order to wisely and effectively minimize
them or fully eliminate. Doctor of economy professor L.P.
Goncharenko
intellectual,
recruiting, political legal, ecological, information, power
components  are  related  here  [8].  Each  of  the  above
functional components of enterprise economic security is
characterized by own content, a set of functional criteria
and ways of implementation. Each manger should know
the  comprehensive  approach  to  assuring  on  business
economic  scurrility  taking  into  account  the  features  of
functioning of its components, because if any component
of the system fails, it would mean the economic subject
state far from safe.

Recently,  many  managers  are  setting  up  special
subdivisions responsible  for  economic  security  of  their
economic  subjects.  It  proves  a  huge  theoretical  and
practical challenge of the problem in question. However,
these  services 
lack  a  developed  and  efficiently
functioning system  of  rating  and  assuring  enterprise
economic security, nor any theoretical base for their own
activity  impairing  their  functioning.  The  economic
security  is  assured  by  this  service  ineffectively  because
they ignore the entire combination of emerging threats not
do  they  apply  the  system  approach 
to  functional
components. As  a  rule,  the  enterprise  management  is
busy with providing separate elements (for instance, only
power,  or  only  information,  or  two-three  components),
rather than the economic security in general.

We  have  studied  a  number  of  enterprises  of  mat
packing industry in the Russian Federation. The analysis
has  revealed that  the economic security  serves  at  many
enterprises deals  with  installation  of  video  cams  and
bugging devices  at  various  structural  subdivisions  in
order to prevent theft and other negative effects both on
the part of personnel and outsiders. It means that only the
power component  is  assured  rather  than  the  whole
economic security system.

As regards other economic subjects in question, their
economic security service, in addition to the same actions,
deals also  with  the  so-called special  checks   of  their
employees during recruiting (court sentences record from
previous  places  of  employment,  study  and  other
records).in  other  words,  both  force  and  recruiting
components  are  fulfilled  at  these  economic  subjects;  it
cannot  be  considered  the  comprehensive  effectively
functioning economic security system of the whole  active
enterprise.

The study of the third group of Russian enterprises
has revealed that, in addition to the power component, the
economic  security  service  closely  interacts  with  the
planning  economic  service,  in  other  words,  it  fulfils a
complex  of  work  to  ensure  high  level  of  enterprise
solvency  and  liquidity  of  securities,  the  most  effective
capital structure, maximization of profit and promotion of
business profitability, et cetera. In other words, the power
and financial components are assured at this enterprise to
enjoy the full economic security system.

The  accomplished  study  shows  that  the  economic
security of Russian enterprises is run without system. The
functional  components  should  be  tied  to  business
strategies and ensure fulfillment of enterprise marketing
strategy. The harmonization of all elaborated strategies is
the  necessary  condition  of  enterprise  efficient  activity.
The  harmonious  is  only  the  system  with  balanced
components.  At 
industrial  enterprise,
harmonization of such strategies as  trade and industrial
policy  are  particularly  challenging.  Namely  this  factor
favors  reinforcement  of  enterprise  economic  security,
particularly  when  Russia  enters  into  the  world  trade
organization,  because  the  world  economy  globalization
compels  enterprises  to  penetrate  into  the  international
area.

CONCLUSIONS

From   the   above   the   economic   security  system
of  industrial  enterprise  can  be  determined  as  the
coordination  of  functional  aims  and  methods  of  its
achievement to ensure the production process and supply
to the end consumer characterized by integral aims of all
components  of  the  system  and  univector  direction  of
actions [author].
