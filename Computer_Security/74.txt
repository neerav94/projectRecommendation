Abstract—Security  is  gaining  awareness  and  importance  in 
recent  years.  Authorized  Access  Security  System  (AASS)  is  a 
network device for validating, monitoring and controlling the 
security within buildings. Today, they are many building that 
are using security access approach to protect the building from 
unauthorized access. In this paper a low cost electronic system 
has  been  designed  which  can  control  different

flexible mechanical design and user friendly interface are the 
salient features of this security system. The system implemented 
to meet both of these needs uses a user-friendly high-security 
interface  that  allows  users  to  access  an  alarmed  area,  and 
authorized users to have field control of the access lists to that 
alarmed area. The paper presents the technology of Authorized 
Access Security System.  This  technology  uses  ATMEL  89C55 
microcontroller  and visual basic program to build data logger 
which provides multiple accesses to a protected area that can be 
an office, home, bank or whatever needed. The data logger was 
added to the system to make records of users who accessed the 
system at any time. Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones design is 
also proposed providing wireless and automatic unlocking

Abstract—Security  is  gaining  awareness  and  importance  in 
recent  years.  Authorized  Access  Security  System  (AASS)  is  a 
network device for validating, monitoring and controlling the 
security within buildings. Today, they are many building that 
are using security access approach to protect the building from 
unauthorized access. In this paper a low cost electronic system 
has  been  designed  which  can  control  different 
locking 
mechanisms. Low operating power consumption, small circuit, 
flexible mechanical design and user friendly interface are the 
salient features of this security system. The system implemented 
to meet both of these needs uses a user-friendly high-security 
interface  that  allows  users  to  access  an  alarmed  area,  and 
authorized users to have field control of the access lists to that 
alarmed area. The paper presents the technology of Authorized 
Access Security System.  This  technology  uses  ATMEL  89C55 
microcontroller  and visual basic program to build data logger 
which provides multiple accesses to a protected area that can be

their 

Authorized  Access  Security  System  and  detail 
functioning. 
A.  ATMEL 89C55 Microcontroller 

A microcontroller (or MCU) is a computer-on-a-chip used 
to control electronic devices. Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: 
ATML)  is  a  manufacturer  of  semiconductors,  founded  in 
1984. Its focus is on system-level solutions built around flash 
microcontrollers.  Its  products 
include  microcontrollers 
(including  8051  derivatives  and  AT91SAM  ARM-based 
micros), and its own Atmel AVR and AVR32 architectures, 
radio frequency (RF) devices, EEPROM and Flash memory 
devices (including Data Flash-based memory), and a number 
of application-specific products. Atmel supplies its devices

as  standard  products,  ASICs,  or  ASSPs  depending  on  the 
requirements of its customers. In some cases it is able to offer 
system on chip solutions. Atmel serves a range of application 
segments  including  consumer,  communications,  computer 
networking,  industrial,  medical,  automotive,  aerospace  and 
military. It is an industry leader in secure systems, notably for 
the  smart  card  market.  The  Microcontroller  used  in  this 
project  is  ATMEL  89C55,  the  choice  of  this  type  of 
Microcontroller  is  determined  by  the  following  criteria 
[1][ 2]: 

1)  The size of the flash memory. 
2)  The 

types  of 

the  contained  memory  FLASH, 

3)  The  interfaces  it  support  RS232,  Ethernet,  USB  or 

EEPROM or ROM. 

other interfaces. 

4)  The size of the MCU layout on the PCB. 
5)  The low cost of MCU. 
6)  The clock cycle has fast speed processing. 
AT89C52 as shown in Fig. 1 consist of [3]: 
(cid:121)  CPU which needs a crystal of 12MHz 
(cid:121)  MEMORY(flash) 
(cid:121)  REGISTERS 
(cid:121)  Addressing 

AT89C52  microcontrollers  consists  of  three  banks  that 
each has 8 registers for data storage R0-R7, also have four 
ports each consisting of 8 pins which can be programmed to 
be input/output[4]. 

A 14-pin access is used in this paper, having eight data lines, 
three control lines and three power lines as shown in Table 
I[6]. 

 

TABLE I: LCD PIN LOCATIONS 

 

 
One of the reasons for using the basic language to program 
the MCU is that BASCOM deals with LCDs, using only three 
command lines is enough to write a text on LCD, as shown in  
Fig. 2.

C.  Keypad Interface with  ATMEL 89C55 

Using keypad provides an easiest and visualized way to 
pass a certain data  to  your  microcontroller;  keypad  can  be 
used to design a calculator, games, door lock system, etc, as 
shown in  Fig. 3. 

 

Fig. 3. Keypad Interface. 

 

There are three techniques of keypad interface:  

(cid:121)  Scanning technique  
(cid:121)  An external electronic design. 
(cid:121)  Using keypad encoder IC (74C923)  

 
Using 16key encoder IC (74C923) 
The chip scans the keypad waiting for a key press. When a 
button is pressed pin 11 of the 74922 goes high. Then a 4 bit 
binary number corresponding to the button press is sent to 
pins 14-17 of the IC. The programming is straight forward; 
use the button command to read the state of pin 11 of  the 

Fig. 1.  ATMEL 8052 structure. 

 
AT89C52 can be programmed by three different languages 

[5]: 

(cid:121)  Assembly language. 
(cid:121)  Basic language. 
(cid:121)  C language 

Basic language is used in this paper to program AT89C55, 

because it is easy to deal with LCD programming. 
B.  Intelligent LCDs  

The  Ability  to  display  letters,  words,  and  all  manner  of 
symbols, not just numbers, makes LCD better than familiar 
7-segment led. There are many types of LCD according to its 
functionality, and varies in Characters length and lines.  Most 
LCD modules conform to a standard interface specification.

One way is a complete hardware design. The design is able to 
detect any motion inside the protected room.  

74922. When its high read the states of pin 14 to 17 and save 
it. Now it has to convent the 4 bit binary number to a decimal 
number. Then use a bunch of; if statements to do what you 
want with each pin of the keypad. The two capacitors are for 
scanning and debouncing times. Pin 5 is for scan and pin 6 is 
the debounce. They don’t have to be .1 uf and 1uf. If a faster 
auto repeat needed, go with a .1uf cap.  Table II is the key

administrator,  and  5  users  group.  This  system  is  design  to 
deal with those two groups with some actions and also to deal 
with the process of illegal entrance. Fig. 6 shows the users 
and the administrator authorities.

ATMEL  89C55  is  divided  into  four  ports,  port  0  to  3.  
Every port is to interface with a component of AASS circuit.  
Port  0  is  chosen  to  interface  with  keypad  decoder,  Port  1 
interfaces  with  LCD,  Port  2  interfaces  with  sensor,  alarm, 
door, and buzzer and Port 3 interfaces with Parallel Port as 
shown in Fig. 7, and Fig. 8.

IV.  VISUAL BASIC PROGRAM 

Visual basic programming and built library provides very 
strong tools which help the program to use RS232, USB and 
parallel  port  easily  [8].  This  program  is  used  by  the 
administrator  of  the  system  to  control  the  system  from  a 
computer which also records the logs by using the data logger 
facility. This system is connected to the keypad-LCD system 
using the parallel port. 

When  the  program  run  a  login  dialogue  will  appear  as 
shown  in  Fig.  9,  to  write  the  administrator  username  and 
password

A.  The Data Logger 
Data logger is designed as shown in Fig. 10, because need 
to know who had an access to the system. The system have 
many users who can log in using the keypad, so this control 
records the events of logging on and also specifies the exact 
time and date for that. It also records when the alarm goes on, 
and if an un-authorized action had happened as in Fig. 11.

Abstract—Security  is  gaining  awareness  and  importance  in 
recent  years.  Authorized  Access  Security  System  (AASS)  is  a 
network device for validating, monitoring and controlling the 
security within buildings. Today, they are many building that 
are using security access approach to protect the building from 
unauthorized access. In this paper a low cost electronic system 
has  been  designed  which  can  control  different 
locking 
mechanisms. Low operating power consumption, small circuit, 
flexible mechanical design and user friendly interface are the 
salient features of this security system. The system implemented 
to meet both of these needs uses a user-friendly high-security 
interface  that  allows  users  to  access  an  alarmed  area,  and 
authorized users to have field control of the access lists to that 
alarmed area. The paper presents the technology of Authorized 
Access Security System.  This  technology  uses  ATMEL  89C55 
microcontroller  and visual basic program to build data logger 
which provides multiple accesses to a protected area that can be 
an office, home, bank or whatever needed. The data logger was 
added to the system to make records of users who accessed the 
system at any time. Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones design is 
also proposed providing wireless and automatic unlocking

an auto save technique designed that will save the data in the 
text field automatically every 10 seconds so that  can avoid 
losing data if the electricity goes off, and it saves the data in a 
file called auto save. 

B.  The Camera Control 
The camera control is added as an accessory to the system, 
because AASS is specialized in the authorized access to the 
room  not  monitoring.  AASS  is  designed  to  be  a  part  of  a 
bigger system that includes monitoring, detection of motion 
as an accessory too. Fig. 12 shows how the camera control 
works,  if  want  to  monitor  the  room  just  click  the  camera 
control button on the control panel then click capture.

C.  The Door Control 
The  administrator  can  open  the  door  from  this  panel  by 

clicking the open door button shown in Figure 10.  
 

V.  AASS DESIGN USING BLUETOOTH 

Access control using Bluetooth mobile device is a design 
solution for a secure access control that can replace physical 
keys  for  accessing  private  buildings.  The  design  of  the 
Bluetooth access control is using digital keys on Bluetooth 
enabled  mobile  phones  providing  wireless  and  automatic 
unlocking [9]. The number of mobile phones equipped with 
Bluetooth  is  steadily  increasing,  and  it  is  becoming  the 
widely  accepted  standard  for  short-range  point-to-point 
communication  A  Bluetooth  interface  to  AASS  that  is  an 
independent  interface  from  the  LCD  &  Keypad,  users  can 
access  the  system  using  their  mobiles  phone  that  have 
Bluetooth support by entering their passwords to access the 
system. Bluetooth is an optional communication technology 
that can replace their normal proprietary system. In designing 
AASS using Bluetooth ( shown in Fig. 13, and Fig. 14); there 
are two protocols have to be programmed by the designer, 
first the designer has to program the mobile phone or the PC, 
second has to program the toothpick device. When the user 
enters the system he must enter the correct password by using 
his  mobile  phone  or  PC.  The  password  data  will  be 
transmitting  directly  to  toothpick  device,  and  it  will  reply 
back a message true or false. The system will unlock if the

Abstract—Security  is  gaining  awareness  and  importance  in 
recent  years.  Authorized  Access  Security  System  (AASS)  is  a 
network device for validating, monitoring and controlling the 
security within buildings. Today, they are many building that 
are using security access approach to protect the building from 
unauthorized access. In this paper a low cost electronic system 
has  been  designed  which  can  control  different 
locking 
mechanisms. Low operating power consumption, small circuit, 
flexible mechanical design and user friendly interface are the 
salient features of this security system. The system implemented 
to meet both of these needs uses a user-friendly high-security 
interface  that  allows  users  to  access  an  alarmed  area,  and 
authorized users to have field control of the access lists to that 
alarmed area. The paper presents the technology of Authorized 
Access Security System.  This  technology  uses  ATMEL  89C55 
microcontroller  and visual basic program to build data logger 
which provides multiple accesses to a protected area that can be 
an office, home, bank or whatever needed. The data logger was 
added to the system to make records of users who accessed the 
system at any time. Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones design is 
also proposed providing wireless and automatic unlocking

II.   SYSTEM HARDWARE COMPONENTS  

This section will present the architectural components of 
their 

Authorized  Access  Security  System  and  detail 
functioning. 
A.  ATMEL 89C55 Microcontroller 

A microcontroller (or MCU) is a computer-on-a-chip used 
to control electronic devices. Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: 
ATML)  is  a  manufacturer  of  semiconductors,  founded  in 
1984. Its focus is on system-level solutions built around flash 
microcontrollers.  Its  products 
include  microcontrollers 
(including  8051  derivatives  and  AT91SAM  ARM-based 
micros), and its own Atmel AVR and AVR32 architectures, 
radio frequency (RF) devices, EEPROM and Flash memory 
devices (including Data Flash-based memory), and a number 
of application-specific products. Atmel supplies its devices 

International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2012112 

 

as  standard  products,  ASICs,  or  ASSPs  depending  on  the 
requirements of its customers. In some cases it is able to offer 
system on chip solutions. Atmel serves a range of application 
segments  including  consumer,  communications,  computer 
networking,  industrial,  medical,  automotive,  aerospace  and 
military. It is an industry leader in secure systems, notably for 
the  smart  card  market.  The  Microcontroller  used  in  this 
project  is  ATMEL  89C55,  the  choice  of  this  type  of 
Microcontroller  is  determined  by  the  following  criteria 
[1][ 2]: 

1)  The size of the flash memory. 
2)  The 

types  of 

the  contained  memory  FLASH, 

3)  The  interfaces  it  support  RS232,  Ethernet,  USB  or 

EEPROM or ROM. 

other interfaces. 

4)  The size of the MCU layout on the PCB. 
5)  The low cost of MCU. 
6)  The clock cycle has fast speed processing. 
AT89C52 as shown in Fig. 1 consist of [3]: 
(cid:121)  CPU which needs a crystal of 12MHz 
(cid:121)  MEMORY(flash) 
(cid:121)  REGISTERS 
(cid:121)  Addressing 

AT89C52  microcontrollers  consists  of  three  banks  that 
each has 8 registers for data storage R0-R7, also have four 
ports each consisting of 8 pins which can be programmed to 
be input/output[4]. 

A 14-pin access is used in this paper, having eight data lines, 
three control lines and three power lines as shown in Table 
I[6]. 

 

TABLE I: LCD PIN LOCATIONS 

 

 
One of the reasons for using the basic language to program 
the MCU is that BASCOM deals with LCDs, using only three 
command lines is enough to write a text on LCD, as shown in  
Fig. 2. 

 

Fig. 2. Three commands to write a text on LCD. 

C.  Keypad Interface with  ATMEL 89C55 

Using keypad provides an easiest and visualized way to 
pass a certain data  to  your  microcontroller;  keypad  can  be 
used to design a calculator, games, door lock system, etc, as 
shown in  Fig. 3. 

 

Fig. 3. Keypad Interface. 

 

There are three techniques of keypad interface:  

(cid:121)  Scanning technique  
(cid:121)  An external electronic design. 
(cid:121)  Using keypad encoder IC (74C923)  

 
Using 16key encoder IC (74C923) 
The chip scans the keypad waiting for a key press. When a 
button is pressed pin 11 of the 74922 goes high. Then a 4 bit 
binary number corresponding to the button press is sent to 
pins 14-17 of the IC. The programming is straight forward; 
use the button command to read the state of pin 11 of  the 

Fig. 1.  ATMEL 8052 structure. 

 
AT89C52 can be programmed by three different languages 

[5]: 

(cid:121)  Assembly language. 
(cid:121)  Basic language. 
(cid:121)  C language 

Basic language is used in this paper to program AT89C55, 

because it is easy to deal with LCD programming. 
B.  Intelligent LCDs  

The  Ability  to  display  letters,  words,  and  all  manner  of 
symbols, not just numbers, makes LCD better than familiar 
7-segment led. There are many types of LCD according to its 
functionality, and varies in Characters length and lines.  Most 
LCD modules conform to a standard interface specification. 

International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2012113 

 

One way is a complete hardware design. The design is able to 
detect any motion inside the protected room.  

74922. When its high read the states of pin 14 to 17 and save 
it. Now it has to convent the 4 bit binary number to a decimal 
number. Then use a bunch of; if statements to do what you 
want with each pin of the keypad. The two capacitors are for 
scanning and debouncing times. Pin 5 is for scan and pin 6 is 
the debounce. They don’t have to be .1 uf and 1uf. If a faster 
auto repeat needed, go with a .1uf cap.  Table II is the key 
pressed and the corresponding 4 bits output.

 Fig. 5. AASS Diagram 

 

The users  of  the  AASS  are  divided  into  two  groups;  an 
administrator,  and  5  users  group.  This  system  is  design  to 
deal with those two groups with some actions and also to deal 
with the process of illegal entrance. Fig. 6 shows the users 
and the administrator authorities.

D.  Passive Infrared Detector (PIR)  

Motion detection is the sensing of physical movement in a 
given area. The principal methods by which motion can be 
identified  are  infra-red  detection  and  acoustical  detection.

ATMEL 89C55   Connection with Components: 
ATMEL  89C55  is  divided  into  four  ports,  port  0  to  3.  
Every port is to interface with a component of AASS circuit.  
Port  0  is  chosen  to  interface  with  keypad  decoder,  Port  1 
interfaces  with  LCD,  Port  2  interfaces  with  sensor,  alarm, 
door, and buzzer and Port 3 interfaces with Parallel Port as 
shown in Fig. 7, and Fig. 8. 

 

 

III.  AASS DESIGN USING ATMEL 89C55    

The purpose of this paper is to design an authorized access 
security system as shown in Fig. 5, using three access ways.

IV.  VISUAL BASIC PROGRAM 

Visual basic programming and built library provides very 
strong tools which help the program to use RS232, USB and 
parallel  port  easily  [8].  This  program  is  used  by  the 
administrator  of  the  system  to  control  the  system  from  a 
computer which also records the logs by using the data logger 
facility. This system is connected to the keypad-LCD system 
using the parallel port. 

When  the  program  run  a  login  dialogue  will  appear  as 
shown  in  Fig.  9,  to  write  the  administrator  username  and 
password 

Fig. 9. Login Dialogue 

 

As user enters the right information he will be logged into 
the  system  control  program  and  ready  to  use  the  control 
panel. 

A.  The Data Logger 
Data logger is designed as shown in Fig. 10, because need 
to know who had an access to the system. The system have 
many users who can log in using the keypad, so this control 
records the events of logging on and also specifies the exact 
time and date for that. It also records when the alarm goes on, 
and if an un-authorized action had happened as in Fig. 11. 

Fig. 10. Data Logger Access 

 

Fig. 11. Data Logger Panel 

As a development to the system a save button is added that 
can save the exact data recorded in the text field to a file at a 
specified program folder that can be accessed any time. Also 

International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2012115 

 

an auto save technique designed that will save the data in the 
text field automatically every 10 seconds so that  can avoid 
losing data if the electricity goes off, and it saves the data in a 
file called auto save. 

B.  The Camera Control 
The camera control is added as an accessory to the system, 
because AASS is specialized in the authorized access to the 
room  not  monitoring.  AASS  is  designed  to  be  a  part  of  a 
bigger system that includes monitoring, detection of motion 
as an accessory too. Fig. 12 shows how the camera control 
works,  if  want  to  monitor  the  room  just  click  the  camera 
control button on the control panel then click capture. 

Fig. 12. Camera Control 

 

C.  The Door Control 
The  administrator  can  open  the  door  from  this  panel  by 

clicking the open door button shown in Figure 10.  
 

V.  AASS DESIGN USING BLUETOOTH 

Access control using Bluetooth mobile device is a design 
solution for a secure access control that can replace physical 
keys  for  accessing  private  buildings.  The  design  of  the 
Bluetooth access control is using digital keys on Bluetooth 
enabled  mobile  phones  providing  wireless  and  automatic 
unlocking [9]. The number of mobile phones equipped with 
Bluetooth  is  steadily  increasing,  and  it  is  becoming  the 
widely  accepted  standard  for  short-range  point-to-point 
communication  A  Bluetooth  interface  to  AASS  that  is  an 
independent  interface  from  the  LCD  &  Keypad,  users  can 
access  the  system  using  their  mobiles  phone  that  have 
Bluetooth support by entering their passwords to access the 
system. Bluetooth is an optional communication technology 
that can replace their normal proprietary system. In designing 
AASS using Bluetooth ( shown in Fig. 13, and Fig. 14); there 
are two protocols have to be programmed by the designer, 
first the designer has to program the mobile phone or the PC, 
second has to program the toothpick device. When the user 
enters the system he must enter the correct password by using 
his  mobile  phone  or  PC.  The  password  data  will  be 
transmitting  directly  to  toothpick  device,  and  it  will  reply 
back a message true or false. The system will unlock if the 
true message arrived.

the  smart  card  market.  The  Microcontroller  used  in  this 
project  is  ATMEL  89C55,  the  choice  of  this  type  of 
Microcontroller  is  determined  by  the  following  criteria 
[1][ 2]: 

1)  The size of the flash memory. 
2)  The 

types  of 

the  contained  memory  FLASH, 

3)  The  interfaces  it  support  RS232,  Ethernet,  USB  or 

EEPROM or ROM. 

other interfaces. 

4)  The size of the MCU layout on the PCB. 
5)  The low cost of MCU. 
6)  The clock cycle has fast speed processing. 
AT89C52 as shown in Fig. 1 consist of [3]: 
(cid:121)  CPU which needs a crystal of 12MHz 
(cid:121)  MEMORY(flash) 
(cid:121)  REGISTERS 
(cid:121)  Addressing 

AT89C52  microcontrollers  consists  of  three  banks  that 
each has 8 registers for data storage R0-R7, also have four 
ports each consisting of 8 pins which can be programmed to 
be input/output[4]. 

A 14-pin access is used in this paper, having eight data lines, 
three control lines and three power lines as shown in Table 
I[6]. 

 

TABLE I: LCD PIN LOCATIONS 

 

 
One of the reasons for using the basic language to program 
the MCU is that BASCOM deals with LCDs, using only three 
command lines is enough to write a text on LCD, as shown in  
Fig. 2.

C.  Keypad Interface with  ATMEL 89C55 

Using keypad provides an easiest and visualized way to 
pass a certain data  to  your  microcontroller;  keypad  can  be 
used to design a calculator, games, door lock system, etc, as 
shown in  Fig. 3. 

 

Fig. 3. Keypad Interface. 

 

There are three techniques of keypad interface:  

(cid:121)  Scanning technique  
(cid:121)  An external electronic design. 
(cid:121)  Using keypad encoder IC (74C923)  

 
Using 16key encoder IC (74C923) 
The chip scans the keypad waiting for a key press. When a 
button is pressed pin 11 of the 74922 goes high. Then a 4 bit 
binary number corresponding to the button press is sent to 
pins 14-17 of the IC. The programming is straight forward; 
use the button command to read the state of pin 11 of  the 

Fig. 1.  ATMEL 8052 structure. 

 
AT89C52 can be programmed by three different languages 

[5]: 

(cid:121)  Assembly language. 
(cid:121)  Basic language. 
(cid:121)  C language 

Basic language is used in this paper to program AT89C55, 

because it is easy to deal with LCD programming. 
B.  Intelligent LCDs  

The  Ability  to  display  letters,  words,  and  all  manner  of 
symbols, not just numbers, makes LCD better than familiar 
7-segment led. There are many types of LCD according to its 
functionality, and varies in Characters length and lines.  Most 
LCD modules conform to a standard interface specification.

One way is a complete hardware design. The design is able to 
detect any motion inside the protected room.  

74922. When its high read the states of pin 14 to 17 and save 
it. Now it has to convent the 4 bit binary number to a decimal 
number. Then use a bunch of; if statements to do what you 
want with each pin of the keypad. The two capacitors are for 
scanning and debouncing times. Pin 5 is for scan and pin 6 is 
the debounce. They don’t have to be .1 uf and 1uf. If a faster 
auto repeat needed, go with a .1uf cap.  Table II is the key 
pressed and the corresponding 4 bits output.

The users  of  the  AASS  are  divided  into  two  groups;  an 
administrator,  and  5  users  group.  This  system  is  design  to 
deal with those two groups with some actions and also to deal 
with the process of illegal entrance. Fig. 6 shows the users 
and the administrator authorities.

D.  Passive Infrared Detector (PIR)  

Motion detection is the sensing of physical movement in a 
given area. The principal methods by which motion can be 
identified  are  infra-red  detection  and  acoustical  detection.

ATMEL 89C55   Connection with Components: 
ATMEL  89C55  is  divided  into  four  ports,  port  0  to  3.  
Every port is to interface with a component of AASS circuit.  
Port  0  is  chosen  to  interface  with  keypad  decoder,  Port  1 
interfaces  with  LCD,  Port  2  interfaces  with  sensor,  alarm, 
door, and buzzer and Port 3 interfaces with Parallel Port as 
shown in Fig. 7, and Fig. 8. 

 

 

III.  AASS DESIGN USING ATMEL 89C55    

The purpose of this paper is to design an authorized access 
security system as shown in Fig. 5, using three access ways.

IV.  VISUAL BASIC PROGRAM 

Visual basic programming and built library provides very 
strong tools which help the program to use RS232, USB and 
parallel  port  easily  [8].  This  program  is  used  by  the 
administrator  of  the  system  to  control  the  system  from  a 
computer which also records the logs by using the data logger 
facility. This system is connected to the keypad-LCD system 
using the parallel port. 

When  the  program  run  a  login  dialogue  will  appear  as 
shown  in  Fig.  9,  to  write  the  administrator  username  and 
password 

Fig. 9. Login Dialogue 

 

As user enters the right information he will be logged into 
the  system  control  program  and  ready  to  use  the  control 
panel. 

A.  The Data Logger 
Data logger is designed as shown in Fig. 10, because need 
to know who had an access to the system. The system have 
many users who can log in using the keypad, so this control 
records the events of logging on and also specifies the exact 
time and date for that. It also records when the alarm goes on, 
and if an un-authorized action had happened as in Fig. 11. 

Fig. 10. Data Logger Access 

 

Fig. 11. Data Logger Panel 

As a development to the system a save button is added that 
can save the exact data recorded in the text field to a file at a 
specified program folder that can be accessed any time. Also 

International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2012115 

 

an auto save technique designed that will save the data in the 
text field automatically every 10 seconds so that  can avoid 
losing data if the electricity goes off, and it saves the data in a 
file called auto save. 

B.  The Camera Control 
The camera control is added as an accessory to the system, 
because AASS is specialized in the authorized access to the 
room  not  monitoring.  AASS  is  designed  to  be  a  part  of  a 
bigger system that includes monitoring, detection of motion 
as an accessory too. Fig. 12 shows how the camera control 
works,  if  want  to  monitor  the  room  just  click  the  camera 
control button on the control panel then click capture.

C.  The Door Control 
The  administrator  can  open  the  door  from  this  panel  by 

clicking the open door button shown in Figure 10.  
 

V.  AASS DESIGN USING BLUETOOTH 

Access control using Bluetooth mobile device is a design 
solution for a secure access control that can replace physical 
keys  for  accessing  private  buildings.  The  design  of  the 
Bluetooth access control is using digital keys on Bluetooth 
enabled  mobile  phones  providing  wireless  and  automatic 
unlocking [9]. The number of mobile phones equipped with 
Bluetooth  is  steadily  increasing,  and  it  is  becoming  the 
widely  accepted  standard  for  short-range  point-to-point 
communication  A  Bluetooth  interface  to  AASS  that  is  an 
independent  interface  from  the  LCD  &  Keypad,  users  can 
access  the  system  using  their  mobiles  phone  that  have 
Bluetooth support by entering their passwords to access the 
system. Bluetooth is an optional communication technology 
that can replace their normal proprietary system. In designing 
AASS using Bluetooth ( shown in Fig. 13, and Fig. 14); there 
are two protocols have to be programmed by the designer, 
first the designer has to program the mobile phone or the PC, 
second has to program the toothpick device. When the user 
enters the system he must enter the correct password by using 
his  mobile  phone  or  PC.  The  password  data  will  be 
transmitting  directly  to  toothpick  device,  and  it  will  reply 
back a message true or false. The system will unlock if the 
true message arrived.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

Security is a growing need throughout the world, and lack 
of security can result in great damage. Many  solutions  are 
available  for  all  levels  of  access  control—from  highly 
restricted  areas  such  as  banks,  or  laboratories  to  less 
restricted areas such as classrooms.  The ultimate purpose of 
developing  an  AASS  is  to  enforce  security  features  of  the 
entire  building  structure,  equipped  with  appropriate 
management  control.  In  this  paper  we  have  designed  two 
systems  that  allow  unlocking  a  secure  door.  Hardware 
designed  using  a  low-cost  low-power  ATMEL  89C55 
microcontroller,  and  a  Bluetooth-enabled  mobile  device 
without user interaction. The design fulfills the requirements 
of  supporting  autonomous 
lock  devices,  easing  key 
distribution  compared  to  physical  keys,  having  minimal 
requirements for the hardware, and supporting personalized 
keys.  To  demonstrate  and  evaluate  the  design,  a  prototype 
was developed. The evaluation shows that the design works 
well, consumes minimal power from the hardware and is able 
to unlock a door.
