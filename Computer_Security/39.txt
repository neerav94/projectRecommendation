Abstract.  Bus  information  system  is  one  of  most  useful  information  system 
these  days.    This  bus  information  system  can  be  implemented  with  smart-
phone  APP  easily  and  conveniently  without  big  cost.  This  BIS  system, 
however,  has  a  weak  point  that  the  location  information  of  the  bus  can  be 
revised  easily.  For  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the  security  aspect  of  the 
proposed  BIS  service,  this  paper  explores  the  security  aspect  of  the  bus 
information system.

1      Introduction 

 
With  the  start  of  21st  century,  the  expansion  and  the  evolution  of  the  mobile 
communication started to cause the change of life style of normal people. In addition, 
the people’s lives have been changed enormously with the invention of smart-phone, 
which was around the year 2010.   
The  smart-phone  enabled  us  think  again  about  every  convenient  system  around  us 
because it has a various abilities that can change the system without any cost. One of 
those  systems  is  bus  information  system  (BIS).  BIS  has  been  devised  to  provide 
people  with  the  information  of  bus  location  and  arrival  time  etc.  But  usually  BIS 
requires big cost to build basic infrastructure for the service. Therefore, the small bus 
company or school bus system could not afford to buy BIS even though they need the 
system desperately. [1] 

This paper introduces BIS based on the use of smart-phone and also try to deliver 

the solution of security matter of the system with extra equipment.   

2      BIS: Bus Information System 

Bus Information System (BIS), which is sometimes known as passenger system out of 
Korea, means a system that can provide bus information such as route, arrival time 
transit information to help passengers with effective transit decision. For this normal 
BIS services, usually huge communication infrastructure is required as in Fig. 1. [2]

This system like in Fig. 1 could enjoy  many benefits of real-time BIS. However, it 
requires  huge  cost  to  construct  the  support  system.  Therefore,  lots  of  small  bus 
companies like school bus or private institute bus could not afford to provide the BIS 
services to the clients even though the service is required for the security reason. To 
provide BIS services with small cost, this paper introduces BIS based on smart-phone 
and explain the security matter. [3][4] 

2.1      BIS service with Smart-Phone   

These days smart-phone has many features like camera, GPS, many sensors and lots 
of other personal programs. With the some functions of smart-phone, we can simulate 
the BIS services. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of BIS based on Smart-phone. 
As we can see in Fig.2, the proposed BIS requires the driver’s smart-phone to deliver 
the  bus  location  information  to  the  local  server.  And  passengers  can  find  bus 
information like arrival time through passenger’s smart phone or display panel in bus 
station. Since the normal smart-phone can deliver its GPS location through 3G or 4G 
mobile network to the dedicated server, the local server can elaborate the bus location 
information after collecting information from the driver’s smart-phone.   
For  this,  we  need  special  application  program  for  driver’s  smart-phone  and  server 
program.  Also  server  needs  to  provide  the  bus  information  to  normal  passengers 
through Internet. Therefore, passengers can find bus information through their smart-
phone or display panel connected to Internet. 
To provide BIS services satisfactorily to passengers, the driver’s smart-phone and the 
local location server are most important in BIS based on smart-phone. The driver’s 
smart-phone has to collect GPS information from satellite when the bus is running on 
schedule  while  the  designated  driver  is  driving  the  bus.  The  driver’s  smart-phone

needs  to  provide  the  bus  location  information  after  collecting  and  processing  the

local server should make various forms of information for passengers. Those would 
be normal web, mobile web, text information for bus station panel and information for 
smart-phone users.

2.2      Security matter in bus information system based on Smart-Phone   

The proposed BIS based on smart-phone has a critical problem in security aspect. The 
problem is that the location information of the dedicated bus is totally dependent on 
the driver’s location. Therefore there’s a case that the driver’s application for BIS is 
operating  without any thought  while the driver is not driving the bus.  And also the 
driver’s application can possibly send other bus information when the driver changed 
the bus. 
To  prevent  those  malfunctioning  case  and  augment  security  aspect  of  the  proposed 
BIS, we need the security augmenting scheme for BIS based on smart-phone.

problem is that the location information of the dedicated bus is totally dependent on

BIS, we need the security augmenting scheme for BIS based on smart-phone. 

Security Aspect for Bus Information System based on Smart Phone2543      Security Consideration for BIS 

To make sure that the information of bus location is only sending to the server while 
the  driver  is  driving  the  dedicated  bus,  we  need  to  consider  security  aspect  of  the 
proposed BIS.   

The proposed BIS is getting the location information of the bus from driver’s smart 
phone.  Therefore  the  application  working  on  driver’s  smart  phone  should  wake  up 
when only the driver is driving the bus. And the application in driver’s smart phone 
should go sleep when driver stops driving. 

For this we need special scheme to secure the BIS based on smart phone apps. 

4      Conclusions 

This  paper  has  introduced  the  new  bus  information  system  based  on  smart-phone. 
Since  the  smart  phones  are  multi  tasking  and  very  resourceful  these  days,  we  can 
replace many usual expensive systems with APPs in smart phones. The same idea has 
been adopted in the proposed BIS. But the proposed BIS has the security problem that 
could create serious problem when it is used in real situation. To prevent this security 
problem, the security augmenting scheme is very necessary. Further study is required 
to make the security system for BIS with smart-phone apps.
