surveillance system, frequently used in a home, an office or a

designs use different types of sensors to achieve reliability by 
means  of  the  different  features  of  each  sensor.  In  this  paper 
we  extend  our  previous  design  not  only  by  using  both 
multiple  PIR  sensors  and  ultrasonic  sensors  as  a  sensor 
group, but also by using the MVM. To enhance the reliability 
of  the  ultrasonic  sensors  group,  we  propose  adding  to  the 
number of bits with coding to reduce the probability of code 
breaking. 

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 

  Fig.1 shows the home embedded surveillance system which 
has  two  groups  of  sensors,  indoor  and  outdoor. The  outdoor 
sensor group contains a number of PIR and pressure sensors 
located next to  windows and doors of a home. The software 
module  of  the  power  embedded  board  turns  on  the  Web 
camera  to  confine  images  and  user  can  outlook  the  images 
captured by the home surveillance system. 

A. PIR Sensor 
       PIR is mostly made of Pyroelectric sensors to increase an 
electric  signal  in  reply  to  alter  in  the  incident  thermal 
radiation.  Every  breathing  body  emits  some  low  level 
radiations  and  the  hotter  the  body,  the  more  is  emitted 
radiation. Commercial PIR sensors typically include two IR-
sensitive  elements  with  opposite  polarization  housed  in  a 
hermetically  sealed  metal  with  a  window  made  of  IR- 
transmissive  material  (typically  coated  silicon  to  shield  the 
sensing  element).  When  the  warm  body  leaves  the  sensing 
area,  the  reverse  happens,  whereby  the  sensor  generates  a 
negative differential change. This chip takes the output of the 
sensor and does some minor processing on it to emit a digital

B. Ultrasonic Sensor 
    Ultrasonic  sensor  is  non-contact  distance  measurement 
module,  which  is  also  compatible  with  electronic  brick.  It’s 
designed  for  easy  modular  project  usage  with  industrial 
performance.  A  short  ultrasonic  pulse  is  transmitted  at  the 
time 0, reflected by an object. The senor receives this signal 
and  converts  it  to  an  electric  signal.  The  next  pulse  can  be 
transmitted when the echo is faded away. This time period is 
called  cycle  period.  The  recommend  cycle  period  should  be 
no less than 50ms. If a 10μs width trigger pulse is sent to the 
signal  pin,  the  Ultrasonic  module  will  output  eight  40  kHz 
ultrasonic  signal  and  detect  the  echo  back.  The  measured 
distance  is  proportional  to  the  echo  pulse  width  and  can  be

the output pin will give a 38ms high level signal.

C. Software 
      The whole system is built around a MCU. MCU requires 
to  be  burned  with  software  written  for  specific  applications. 
The  code  is  written  using  ASSEMBLY  language  and 
compiled using MPLAB. MPLAB generated a hex file which 
is  burned  using  a  burner 
the  IC.  This  section 
demonstrates  the  flowchart  of  the  software  which  helps  to 
visualize the coding steps as shown in fig.3.

D. Wireless Camera 
    Wireless  technology  is  being  applied  to  just  about 
everything  these  days,  and  video  surveillance  takes  good 
advantage  of  it.  A  wireless  camera  is  one  with  a  built-in 
transmitter to send video over the air to a receiver instead of 
through a wire as shown in below fig.4. The thing that many 
people  aren’t  aware  of  is  that  there  are  multiple  types  of 
wireless technology in use, each with unique advantages and 
disadvantages.  Most  wireless  cameras  are 
technically 
cordless  devices,  meaning  that  though  they  transmit  a  radio 
signal,  they  still  need  to  be  plugged  in  to  a  power  source. 
Wireless is the commonly used industry term, though. Some 
do have batteries, making them truly wireless, but these tend 
to  only  last  for  a  few  hours  at  a  time  between  charges.       
These  devices  work  on  a  simple  principle.  The  camera 
contains  a  wireless  radio  (RF)  transmitter.  This  transmitter 
broadcasts  the  camera's  video,  which  can  be  picked  up  by  a 
receiver,  which  will  be  connected  to  a  monitor  or  recording 
device.  Some  receivers  have  built-in  storage,  while  others 
must be connected to a DVR. 

Fig.4.Wireless camera. 

 

1. Analog vs. Digital 
      There  are  2  basic  types  of  RF  transmissions,  analog  and 
digital. Analog  devices  send  out  a  constant  string  of  data 
when they transmit. These can be picked up by any receiver 
that  picks  up  signal  in  its  frequency  range.  This  means  that 
anyone  with  a  properly  tuned  receiver  can  pick  up  a 
transmitter.  It  also  makes  interference  more  likely.  If  there 
are multiple transmitters in the same area, the most powerful 
signal will knock out any others in range. They are easier to 
set up, though, since no pairing between camera and receiver 
is  necessary.  Digital  wireless  cameras  work  a  little  bit 
differently.  They  modulate  their  signal  slightly,  constantly 
cycling through  frequencies in a order to avoid interference. 
This also  makes  transmissions  more  secure. In order to pick 
up  this  video  feed,  a  receiver  needs  to  be  paired  with  the 
camera.  This  means  they  are  being  programmed  to  cycle 
through  frequencies  at  the  same  rate.    Whether  analog  or 
digital,  most  commercially  available  electronic  devices  that 
broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz ranges.

2. Types of Wireless 
  Whether  analog  or  digital,  most  commercially  available 
electronic devices that broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz 
or 5.8 GHz ranges. 900 MHz and 1.2 GHz were common at 
one time, but have both been nearly completely phased out of 
use.  2.4  GHz  and  5.8  GHz  cameras  are  similar  in  function. 
Both  contain  a  transmitter  that  sends  a  signal  to  a  receiver, 
which  can  be  connected  to  a  monitor  to  view  or  a  DVR  to 
record. 

2.4 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog. 
  Has a maximum practical range of about 700 feet. 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  4 

transmissions. 

  The 

frequency  most  cordless/wireless  devices 
transmit  on,  so  analog  devices  are  very  prone  to 
interference. 

5.8 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog 
  Maximum range of about 2000 feet 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  8 

transmissions 

  Used  by  fewer  household  devices,  less  prone  to 

interference 

  Analog  signals  can  still  be  picked  up  by  outside 

receivers 

 

Wi-Fi:  Wi-Fi  cameras  are  wireless  IP  cameras.  They  allow 
multiple devices to be networked together and access a local 
area network through a  wireless router. Each device talks  to 
the  router,  which  can  send  information  back  and  forth  to 
other networked devices as  well as to and  from  the internet. 
A typical Wi-Fi router has a range of about 150-300 feet and 
can (for practical purposes) connect as many devices as they 
have  bandwidth  to  support.  Typically,  routers  are  not 
included  with 
these  cameras  and  must  be  purchased 
separately.  What  makes  Wi-Fi  cameras  so  popular  is  that 
they  allow  remote  access  to  a  video  feed  from  outside  the 
network.  Set  up  can  be  more  complicated  than  traditional 
wireless  cameras  and  usually  requires  the  user  to  have  a  PC 
available to set up the camera. 

Cellular:  Cellular  cameras,  sometimes  also  called  3G 
cameras  contain  a  cellular  transmitter  and  connect  to  a 
cellular network to send video. In function, they can be very 
similar  to  Wi-Fi  cameras.  This  is  the  newest  of  the  wireless 
technologies,  and  reliability  can  vary  widely,  largely  based 
on network conditions. 

    These  also  tend  to  be  very  costly.  Not  only  is  equipment 
expensive, but it also requires a cellular data plan in order to 
transmit video. These costs can vary by cellular carrier, and a 
lack  of  cellular  coverage  can  render  the  devices  inoperable. 
As costs drop, expect to see this type of camera become more 
and more popular.

security.  The 

surveillance

systems  have  become  more 
    Recently 
embedded 
important 
surveillance system, frequently used in a home, an office or a 
factory,  uses  a  sensor  triggered  to  turn  on  a  camera.  Some 
designs use different types of sensors to achieve reliability by 
means  of  the  different  features  of  each  sensor.  In  this  paper 
we  extend  our  previous  design  not  only  by  using  both 
multiple  PIR  sensors  and  ultrasonic  sensors  as  a  sensor 
group, but also by using the MVM. To enhance the reliability 
of  the  ultrasonic  sensors  group,  we  propose  adding  to  the 
number of bits with coding to reduce the probability of code 
breaking. 

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 

  Fig.1 shows the home embedded surveillance system which 
has  two  groups  of  sensors,  indoor  and  outdoor. The  outdoor 
sensor group contains a number of PIR and pressure sensors 
located next to  windows and doors of a home. The software 
module  of  the  power  embedded  board  turns  on  the  Web 
camera  to  confine  images  and  user  can  outlook  the  images 
captured by the home surveillance system. 

A. PIR Sensor 
       PIR is mostly made of Pyroelectric sensors to increase an 
electric  signal  in  reply  to  alter  in  the  incident  thermal 
radiation.  Every  breathing  body  emits  some  low  level 
radiations  and  the  hotter  the  body,  the  more  is  emitted 
radiation. Commercial PIR sensors typically include two IR-
sensitive  elements  with  opposite  polarization  housed  in  a 
hermetically  sealed  metal  with  a  window  made  of  IR- 
transmissive  material  (typically  coated  silicon  to  shield  the 
sensing  element).  When  the  warm  body  leaves  the  sensing 
area,  the  reverse  happens,  whereby  the  sensor  generates  a 
negative differential change. This chip takes the output of the 
sensor and does some minor processing on it to emit a digital

low alert & GSM model. 

B. Ultrasonic Sensor 
    Ultrasonic  sensor  is  non-contact  distance  measurement 
module,  which  is  also  compatible  with  electronic  brick.  It’s 
designed  for  easy  modular  project  usage  with  industrial 
performance.  A  short  ultrasonic  pulse  is  transmitted  at  the 
time 0, reflected by an object. The senor receives this signal 
and  converts  it  to  an  electric  signal.  The  next  pulse  can  be 
transmitted when the echo is faded away. This time period is 
called  cycle  period.  The  recommend  cycle  period  should  be 
no less than 50ms. If a 10μs width trigger pulse is sent to the 
signal  pin,  the  Ultrasonic  module  will  output  eight  40  kHz 
ultrasonic  signal  and  detect  the  echo  back.  The  measured 
distance  is  proportional  to  the  echo  pulse  width  and  can  be

calculated  by  the  formula  above.  If  no  obstacle  is  detected, 
the output pin will give a 38ms high level signal.

C. Software 
      The whole system is built around a MCU. MCU requires 
to  be  burned  with  software  written  for  specific  applications. 
The  code  is  written  using  ASSEMBLY  language  and 
compiled using MPLAB. MPLAB generated a hex file which 
is  burned  using  a  burner 
the  IC.  This  section 
demonstrates  the  flowchart  of  the  software  which  helps  to 
visualize the coding steps as shown in fig.3.

D. Wireless Camera 
    Wireless  technology  is  being  applied  to  just  about 
everything  these  days,  and  video  surveillance  takes  good 
advantage  of  it.  A  wireless  camera  is  one  with  a  built-in 
transmitter to send video over the air to a receiver instead of 
through a wire as shown in below fig.4. The thing that many 
people  aren’t  aware  of  is  that  there  are  multiple  types  of 
wireless technology in use, each with unique advantages and 
disadvantages.  Most  wireless  cameras  are 
technically 
cordless  devices,  meaning  that  though  they  transmit  a  radio 
signal,  they  still  need  to  be  plugged  in  to  a  power  source. 
Wireless is the commonly used industry term, though. Some 
do have batteries, making them truly wireless, but these tend 
to  only  last  for  a  few  hours  at  a  time  between  charges.       
These  devices  work  on  a  simple  principle.  The  camera 
contains  a  wireless  radio  (RF)  transmitter.  This  transmitter 
broadcasts  the  camera's  video,  which  can  be  picked  up  by  a 
receiver,  which  will  be  connected  to  a  monitor  or  recording 
device.  Some  receivers  have  built-in  storage,  while  others 
must be connected to a DVR. 

Fig.4.Wireless camera. 

 

1. Analog vs. Digital 
      There  are  2  basic  types  of  RF  transmissions,  analog  and 
digital. Analog  devices  send  out  a  constant  string  of  data 
when they transmit. These can be picked up by any receiver 
that  picks  up  signal  in  its  frequency  range.  This  means  that 
anyone  with  a  properly  tuned  receiver  can  pick  up  a 
transmitter.  It  also  makes  interference  more  likely.  If  there 
are multiple transmitters in the same area, the most powerful 
signal will knock out any others in range. They are easier to 
set up, though, since no pairing between camera and receiver 
is  necessary.  Digital  wireless  cameras  work  a  little  bit 
differently.  They  modulate  their  signal  slightly,  constantly 
cycling through  frequencies in a order to avoid interference. 
This also  makes  transmissions  more  secure. In order to pick 
up  this  video  feed,  a  receiver  needs  to  be  paired  with  the 
camera.  This  means  they  are  being  programmed  to  cycle 
through  frequencies  at  the  same  rate.    Whether  analog  or 
digital,  most  commercially  available  electronic  devices  that 
broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz ranges.

2. Types of Wireless 
  Whether  analog  or  digital,  most  commercially  available 
electronic devices that broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz 
or 5.8 GHz ranges. 900 MHz and 1.2 GHz were common at 
one time, but have both been nearly completely phased out of 
use.  2.4  GHz  and  5.8  GHz  cameras  are  similar  in  function. 
Both  contain  a  transmitter  that  sends  a  signal  to  a  receiver, 
which  can  be  connected  to  a  monitor  to  view  or  a  DVR  to 
record. 

2.4 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog. 
  Has a maximum practical range of about 700 feet. 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  4 

transmissions. 

  The 

frequency  most  cordless/wireless  devices 
transmit  on,  so  analog  devices  are  very  prone  to 
interference. 

5.8 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog 
  Maximum range of about 2000 feet 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  8 

transmissions 

  Used  by  fewer  household  devices,  less  prone  to 

interference 

  Analog  signals  can  still  be  picked  up  by  outside 

receivers 

 

Wi-Fi:  Wi-Fi  cameras  are  wireless  IP  cameras.  They  allow 
multiple devices to be networked together and access a local 
area network through a  wireless router. Each device talks  to 
the  router,  which  can  send  information  back  and  forth  to 
other networked devices as  well as to and  from  the internet. 
A typical Wi-Fi router has a range of about 150-300 feet and 
can (for practical purposes) connect as many devices as they 
have  bandwidth  to  support.  Typically,  routers  are  not 
included  with 
these  cameras  and  must  be  purchased 
separately.  What  makes  Wi-Fi  cameras  so  popular  is  that 
they  allow  remote  access  to  a  video  feed  from  outside  the 
network.  Set  up  can  be  more  complicated  than  traditional 
wireless  cameras  and  usually  requires  the  user  to  have  a  PC 
available to set up the camera. 

Cellular:  Cellular  cameras,  sometimes  also  called  3G 
cameras  contain  a  cellular  transmitter  and  connect  to  a 
cellular network to send video. In function, they can be very 
similar  to  Wi-Fi  cameras.  This  is  the  newest  of  the  wireless 
technologies,  and  reliability  can  vary  widely,  largely  based 
on network conditions. 

    These  also  tend  to  be  very  costly.  Not  only  is  equipment 
expensive, but it also requires a cellular data plan in order to 
transmit video. These costs can vary by cellular carrier, and a 
lack  of  cellular  coverage  can  render  the  devices  inoperable. 
As costs drop, expect to see this type of camera become more 
and more popular.

I. INTRODUCTION 

everyone’s 

security.  The 

surveillance 
for 

systems  have  become  more 
    Recently 
embedded 
important 
surveillance system, frequently used in a home, an office or a 
factory,  uses  a  sensor  triggered  to  turn  on  a  camera.  Some 
designs use different types of sensors to achieve reliability by 
means  of  the  different  features  of  each  sensor.  In  this  paper 
we  extend  our  previous  design  not  only  by  using  both 
multiple  PIR  sensors  and  ultrasonic  sensors  as  a  sensor 
group, but also by using the MVM. To enhance the reliability 
of  the  ultrasonic  sensors  group,  we  propose  adding  to  the 
number of bits with coding to reduce the probability of code 
breaking. 

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 

  Fig.1 shows the home embedded surveillance system which 
has  two  groups  of  sensors,  indoor  and  outdoor. The  outdoor 
sensor group contains a number of PIR and pressure sensors 
located next to  windows and doors of a home. The software 
module  of  the  power  embedded  board  turns  on  the  Web 
camera  to  confine  images  and  user  can  outlook  the  images 
captured by the home surveillance system. 

A. PIR Sensor 
       PIR is mostly made of Pyroelectric sensors to increase an 
electric  signal  in  reply  to  alter  in  the  incident  thermal 
radiation.  Every  breathing  body  emits  some  low  level 
radiations  and  the  hotter  the  body,  the  more  is  emitted 
radiation. Commercial PIR sensors typically include two IR-
sensitive  elements  with  opposite  polarization  housed  in  a 
hermetically  sealed  metal  with  a  window  made  of  IR- 
transmissive  material  (typically  coated  silicon  to  shield  the 
sensing  element).  When  the  warm  body  leaves  the  sensing 
area,  the  reverse  happens,  whereby  the  sensor  generates  a 
negative differential change. This chip takes the output of the 
sensor and does some minor processing on it to emit a digital

low alert & GSM model. 

B. Ultrasonic Sensor 
    Ultrasonic  sensor  is  non-contact  distance  measurement 
module,  which  is  also  compatible  with  electronic  brick.  It’s 
designed  for  easy  modular  project  usage  with  industrial 
performance.  A  short  ultrasonic  pulse  is  transmitted  at  the 
time 0, reflected by an object. The senor receives this signal 
and  converts  it  to  an  electric  signal.  The  next  pulse  can  be 
transmitted when the echo is faded away. This time period is 
called  cycle  period.  The  recommend  cycle  period  should  be 
no less than 50ms. If a 10μs width trigger pulse is sent to the 
signal  pin,  the  Ultrasonic  module  will  output  eight  40  kHz 
ultrasonic  signal  and  detect  the  echo  back.  The  measured 
distance  is  proportional  to  the  echo  pulse  width  and  can  be

calculated  by  the  formula  above.  If  no  obstacle  is  detected, 
the output pin will give a 38ms high level signal.

C. Software 
      The whole system is built around a MCU. MCU requires 
to  be  burned  with  software  written  for  specific  applications. 
The  code  is  written  using  ASSEMBLY  language  and 
compiled using MPLAB. MPLAB generated a hex file which 
is  burned  using  a  burner 
the  IC.  This  section 
demonstrates  the  flowchart  of  the  software  which  helps  to 
visualize the coding steps as shown in fig.3.

D. Wireless Camera 
    Wireless  technology  is  being  applied  to  just  about 
everything  these  days,  and  video  surveillance  takes  good 
advantage  of  it.  A  wireless  camera  is  one  with  a  built-in 
transmitter to send video over the air to a receiver instead of 
through a wire as shown in below fig.4. The thing that many 
people  aren’t  aware  of  is  that  there  are  multiple  types  of 
wireless technology in use, each with unique advantages and 
disadvantages.  Most  wireless  cameras  are 
technically 
cordless  devices,  meaning  that  though  they  transmit  a  radio 
signal,  they  still  need  to  be  plugged  in  to  a  power  source. 
Wireless is the commonly used industry term, though. Some 
do have batteries, making them truly wireless, but these tend 
to  only  last  for  a  few  hours  at  a  time  between  charges.       
These  devices  work  on  a  simple  principle.  The  camera 
contains  a  wireless  radio  (RF)  transmitter.  This  transmitter 
broadcasts  the  camera's  video,  which  can  be  picked  up  by  a 
receiver,  which  will  be  connected  to  a  monitor  or  recording 
device.  Some  receivers  have  built-in  storage,  while  others 
must be connected to a DVR. 

Fig.4.Wireless camera. 

 

1. Analog vs. Digital 
      There  are  2  basic  types  of  RF  transmissions,  analog  and 
digital. Analog  devices  send  out  a  constant  string  of  data 
when they transmit. These can be picked up by any receiver 
that  picks  up  signal  in  its  frequency  range.  This  means  that 
anyone  with  a  properly  tuned  receiver  can  pick  up  a 
transmitter.  It  also  makes  interference  more  likely.  If  there 
are multiple transmitters in the same area, the most powerful 
signal will knock out any others in range. They are easier to 
set up, though, since no pairing between camera and receiver 
is  necessary.  Digital  wireless  cameras  work  a  little  bit 
differently.  They  modulate  their  signal  slightly,  constantly 
cycling through  frequencies in a order to avoid interference. 
This also  makes  transmissions  more  secure. In order to pick 
up  this  video  feed,  a  receiver  needs  to  be  paired  with  the 
camera.  This  means  they  are  being  programmed  to  cycle 
through  frequencies  at  the  same  rate.    Whether  analog  or 
digital,  most  commercially  available  electronic  devices  that 
broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz ranges.

2. Types of Wireless 
  Whether  analog  or  digital,  most  commercially  available 
electronic devices that broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz 
or 5.8 GHz ranges. 900 MHz and 1.2 GHz were common at 
one time, but have both been nearly completely phased out of 
use.  2.4  GHz  and  5.8  GHz  cameras  are  similar  in  function. 
Both  contain  a  transmitter  that  sends  a  signal  to  a  receiver, 
which  can  be  connected  to  a  monitor  to  view  or  a  DVR  to 
record. 

2.4 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog. 
  Has a maximum practical range of about 700 feet. 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  4 

transmissions. 

  The 

frequency  most  cordless/wireless  devices 
transmit  on,  so  analog  devices  are  very  prone  to 
interference. 

5.8 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog 
  Maximum range of about 2000 feet 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  8 

transmissions 

  Used  by  fewer  household  devices,  less  prone  to 

interference 

  Analog  signals  can  still  be  picked  up  by  outside 

receivers 

 

Wi-Fi:  Wi-Fi  cameras  are  wireless  IP  cameras.  They  allow 
multiple devices to be networked together and access a local 
area network through a  wireless router. Each device talks  to 
the  router,  which  can  send  information  back  and  forth  to 
other networked devices as  well as to and  from  the internet. 
A typical Wi-Fi router has a range of about 150-300 feet and 
can (for practical purposes) connect as many devices as they 
have  bandwidth  to  support.  Typically,  routers  are  not 
included  with 
these  cameras  and  must  be  purchased 
separately.  What  makes  Wi-Fi  cameras  so  popular  is  that 
they  allow  remote  access  to  a  video  feed  from  outside  the 
network.  Set  up  can  be  more  complicated  than  traditional 
wireless  cameras  and  usually  requires  the  user  to  have  a  PC 
available to set up the camera. 

Cellular:  Cellular  cameras,  sometimes  also  called  3G 
cameras  contain  a  cellular  transmitter  and  connect  to  a 
cellular network to send video. In function, they can be very 
similar  to  Wi-Fi  cameras.  This  is  the  newest  of  the  wireless 
technologies,  and  reliability  can  vary  widely,  largely  based 
on network conditions. 

    These  also  tend  to  be  very  costly.  Not  only  is  equipment 
expensive, but it also requires a cellular data plan in order to 
transmit video. These costs can vary by cellular carrier, and a 
lack  of  cellular  coverage  can  render  the  devices  inoperable. 
As costs drop, expect to see this type of camera become more 
and more popular.

IV. CONCLUSION 

   Our experiment shows two different types of sensors which 
are  enhancing  the  overall  sensing  probability  by  using  the 
MVM  to  reduce  the  shortcomings  of  both  the  ultrasonic 
sensors and the PIR sensors. By adding an ultrasonic coding 
signal  our  design  reduces  the  miss  rate  of  the  receiver  with 
ultrasonic  sensors  by  different  patterns,  improving  the 
reliability of the overall system.

I. INTRODUCTION 

everyone’s 

security.  The 

surveillance 
for 

systems  have  become  more 
    Recently 
embedded 
important 
surveillance system, frequently used in a home, an office or a 
factory,  uses  a  sensor  triggered  to  turn  on  a  camera.  Some 
designs use different types of sensors to achieve reliability by 
means  of  the  different  features  of  each  sensor.  In  this  paper 
we  extend  our  previous  design  not  only  by  using  both 
multiple  PIR  sensors  and  ultrasonic  sensors  as  a  sensor 
group, but also by using the MVM. To enhance the reliability 
of  the  ultrasonic  sensors  group,  we  propose  adding  to  the 
number of bits with coding to reduce the probability of code 
breaking. 

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 

  Fig.1 shows the home embedded surveillance system which 
has  two  groups  of  sensors,  indoor  and  outdoor. The  outdoor 
sensor group contains a number of PIR and pressure sensors 
located next to  windows and doors of a home. The software 
module  of  the  power  embedded  board  turns  on  the  Web 
camera  to  confine  images  and  user  can  outlook  the  images 
captured by the home surveillance system. 

A. PIR Sensor 
       PIR is mostly made of Pyroelectric sensors to increase an 
electric  signal  in  reply  to  alter  in  the  incident  thermal 
radiation.  Every  breathing  body  emits  some  low  level 
radiations  and  the  hotter  the  body,  the  more  is  emitted 
radiation. Commercial PIR sensors typically include two IR-
sensitive  elements  with  opposite  polarization  housed  in  a 
hermetically  sealed  metal  with  a  window  made  of  IR- 
transmissive  material  (typically  coated  silicon  to  shield  the 
sensing  element).  When  the  warm  body  leaves  the  sensing 
area,  the  reverse  happens,  whereby  the  sensor  generates  a 
negative differential change. This chip takes the output of the 
sensor and does some minor processing on it to emit a digital

low alert & GSM model. 

B. Ultrasonic Sensor 
    Ultrasonic  sensor  is  non-contact  distance  measurement 
module,  which  is  also  compatible  with  electronic  brick.  It’s 
designed  for  easy  modular  project  usage  with  industrial 
performance.  A  short  ultrasonic  pulse  is  transmitted  at  the 
time 0, reflected by an object. The senor receives this signal 
and  converts  it  to  an  electric  signal.  The  next  pulse  can  be 
transmitted when the echo is faded away. This time period is 
called  cycle  period.  The  recommend  cycle  period  should  be 
no less than 50ms. If a 10μs width trigger pulse is sent to the 
signal  pin,  the  Ultrasonic  module  will  output  eight  40  kHz 
ultrasonic  signal  and  detect  the  echo  back.  The  measured 
distance  is  proportional  to  the  echo  pulse  width  and  can  be

calculated  by  the  formula  above.  If  no  obstacle  is  detected, 
the output pin will give a 38ms high level signal.

C. Software 
      The whole system is built around a MCU. MCU requires 
to  be  burned  with  software  written  for  specific  applications. 
The  code  is  written  using  ASSEMBLY  language  and 
compiled using MPLAB. MPLAB generated a hex file which 
is  burned  using  a  burner 
the  IC.  This  section 
demonstrates  the  flowchart  of  the  software  which  helps  to 
visualize the coding steps as shown in fig.3.

D. Wireless Camera 
    Wireless  technology  is  being  applied  to  just  about 
everything  these  days,  and  video  surveillance  takes  good 
advantage  of  it.  A  wireless  camera  is  one  with  a  built-in 
transmitter to send video over the air to a receiver instead of 
through a wire as shown in below fig.4. The thing that many 
people  aren’t  aware  of  is  that  there  are  multiple  types  of 
wireless technology in use, each with unique advantages and 
disadvantages.  Most  wireless  cameras  are 
technically 
cordless  devices,  meaning  that  though  they  transmit  a  radio 
signal,  they  still  need  to  be  plugged  in  to  a  power  source. 
Wireless is the commonly used industry term, though. Some 
do have batteries, making them truly wireless, but these tend 
to  only  last  for  a  few  hours  at  a  time  between  charges.       
These  devices  work  on  a  simple  principle.  The  camera 
contains  a  wireless  radio  (RF)  transmitter.  This  transmitter 
broadcasts  the  camera's  video,  which  can  be  picked  up  by  a 
receiver,  which  will  be  connected  to  a  monitor  or  recording 
device.  Some  receivers  have  built-in  storage,  while  others 
must be connected to a DVR. 

Fig.4.Wireless camera. 

 

1. Analog vs. Digital 
      There  are  2  basic  types  of  RF  transmissions,  analog  and 
digital. Analog  devices  send  out  a  constant  string  of  data 
when they transmit. These can be picked up by any receiver 
that  picks  up  signal  in  its  frequency  range.  This  means  that 
anyone  with  a  properly  tuned  receiver  can  pick  up  a 
transmitter.  It  also  makes  interference  more  likely.  If  there 
are multiple transmitters in the same area, the most powerful 
signal will knock out any others in range. They are easier to 
set up, though, since no pairing between camera and receiver 
is  necessary.  Digital  wireless  cameras  work  a  little  bit 
differently.  They  modulate  their  signal  slightly,  constantly 
cycling through  frequencies in a order to avoid interference. 
This also  makes  transmissions  more  secure. In order to pick 
up  this  video  feed,  a  receiver  needs  to  be  paired  with  the 
camera.  This  means  they  are  being  programmed  to  cycle 
through  frequencies  at  the  same  rate.    Whether  analog  or 
digital,  most  commercially  available  electronic  devices  that 
broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz ranges.

2. Types of Wireless 
  Whether  analog  or  digital,  most  commercially  available 
electronic devices that broadcast do so in either the 2.4 GHz 
or 5.8 GHz ranges. 900 MHz and 1.2 GHz were common at 
one time, but have both been nearly completely phased out of 
use.  2.4  GHz  and  5.8  GHz  cameras  are  similar  in  function. 
Both  contain  a  transmitter  that  sends  a  signal  to  a  receiver, 
which  can  be  connected  to  a  monitor  to  view  or  a  DVR  to 
record. 

2.4 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog. 
  Has a maximum practical range of about 700 feet. 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  4 

transmissions. 

  The 

frequency  most  cordless/wireless  devices 
transmit  on,  so  analog  devices  are  very  prone  to 
interference. 

5.8 GHz: 

  Available in digital and analog 
  Maximum range of about 2000 feet 
  A  single  receiver  can  carry  a  maximum  of  8 

transmissions 

  Used  by  fewer  household  devices,  less  prone  to 

interference 

  Analog  signals  can  still  be  picked  up  by  outside 

receivers 

 

Wi-Fi:  Wi-Fi  cameras  are  wireless  IP  cameras.  They  allow 
multiple devices to be networked together and access a local 
area network through a  wireless router. Each device talks  to 
the  router,  which  can  send  information  back  and  forth  to 
other networked devices as  well as to and  from  the internet. 
A typical Wi-Fi router has a range of about 150-300 feet and 
can (for practical purposes) connect as many devices as they 
have  bandwidth  to  support.  Typically,  routers  are  not 
included  with 
these  cameras  and  must  be  purchased 
separately.  What  makes  Wi-Fi  cameras  so  popular  is  that 
they  allow  remote  access  to  a  video  feed  from  outside  the 
network.  Set  up  can  be  more  complicated  than  traditional 
wireless  cameras  and  usually  requires  the  user  to  have  a  PC 
available to set up the camera. 

Cellular:  Cellular  cameras,  sometimes  also  called  3G 
cameras  contain  a  cellular  transmitter  and  connect  to  a 
cellular network to send video. In function, they can be very 
similar  to  Wi-Fi  cameras.  This  is  the  newest  of  the  wireless 
technologies,  and  reliability  can  vary  widely,  largely  based 
on network conditions. 

    These  also  tend  to  be  very  costly.  Not  only  is  equipment 
expensive, but it also requires a cellular data plan in order to 
transmit video. These costs can vary by cellular carrier, and a 
lack  of  cellular  coverage  can  render  the  devices  inoperable. 
As costs drop, expect to see this type of camera become more 
and more popular.

IV. CONCLUSION 

   Our experiment shows two different types of sensors which 
are  enhancing  the  overall  sensing  probability  by  using  the 
MVM  to  reduce  the  shortcomings  of  both  the  ultrasonic 
sensors and the PIR sensors. By adding an ultrasonic coding 
signal  our  design  reduces  the  miss  rate  of  the  receiver  with 
ultrasonic  sensors  by  different  patterns,  improving  the 
reliability of the overall system.
