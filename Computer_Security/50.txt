The potential application of RFID technology
is limited only to one's imagination. Although a
popular belief holds that RFID is best suited to
supply-chain management or consumer packaged

RFID applications goes far beyond these areas.
In fact, a variety of established RFID application
types have already been deployed successfully in
real-world environments. RFID is an emerging

way to electronically control, detect and track a
variety of items using FM transmission methods
