Abstract.  Today,  RFID  technologies  are  being  applied  in  ubiquitous  sensor 
network  system  to  improve  the  quality  of  healthcare  system.  In  this  paper,  we 
have investigated and surveyed on security and privacy issues in RFID systems 
and  their  applications  related  with  IoT  (Internet  on  Things).  Wireless  sensor 
networks  can  be  applied  for  ubiquitous  health  monitoring,  improving  users' 
well-being, making the healthcare system more efficient, and helping to quickly 
react  on  emergency  situations.  To  meet  the  strict  security  needs  of  ubiquitous 
medical  applications  is  a  big  challenge.  We  surveyed  a  deployment  model  for 
pervasive healthcare regarding to patient area and medical sensor networks.

personal details for the  medical purpose such as patient’s medical history. However, 
only a few hospitals are aware of the security issues because their working process is 
mainly  focused  on  emergency  than  security  matters.  This  may  result  in  a  security 
incident  such  as  information  leakage.  Therefore,  we  proposed  a  suitable  wireless 
security mechanism for the hospital. To begin with, the organizational characteristics 
of  the  hospital  should  be  analyzed  before  selecting  the  wireless  mechanism.  With 
mobile devices in HIS, the staff will be able to access EMR systems to view or update 
patient’s medical records. The usual methods to provide security at the network level, 
in the case of packet networks, are datagram encapsulation. One of the most common 
technologies  used  to  ensure  secure  communications  in  the  Internet  is  the  Internet 
Protocol  Security  (IPsec)  protocol. IPsec  is  an  end-to-end  security  scheme  operating 
in the IP stack, enabling both authentication and conﬁdentiality [11]. Although IPsec 
ensures these security services to any protocol in the upper layers, it introduces some 
overhead that will reduce throughput. The security framework focuses on mechanisms 
for  the  distribution  and  establishment  of  secret  keys  that  allow  bootstrapping  secure 
links, access control to the sensed information, and privacy-aware management of the 
medical  data  and  user's  identities.  We  combine  centralized  and  distributed  security 
solutions in order to  provide an adequate balance between  performance and security 
requirements. Network security and management play an important role in above each 
level.  Then  we  should  analyze  the  security  features  in  each  layer  such  as  perceptual 
layer,  network  layer,  support  layer  and  application  layer.  Now,  we  should  take  into 
account  to  look  into  the  state  of  research  for  the  security  requirements  such  as 
encryption  mechanism,  communication  security,  protecting  sensor  data,  and 
cryptographic algorithms in communication channel [12].

In  this  paper,  security  issues  on  the  IoT 
construction layers is analyzed and appropriate coping strategies are given to build a 
safe  IoT  construction  so  that  the  IoT  can  protect  revealing  healthy  and  stable 
development  in  practical  applications.  A  challenge  in  the  near  future  will  be  the 
integration of  IoT  with security protocols to the hospital environment.  Developing a 
security protocol in u-healthcare environment is major concern in future.
