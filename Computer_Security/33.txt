Abstract: VLSI based Accident information and car security system deals with the concern of saving the victim,
who gets trapped in accident and also about the car security. Accident of the car is detected using pressor
sensors which are fixed in car. Accident information to the nearest hospital is carried out with the help of RF
communication. The location of the car is found using the GPS technique. The security of car is ensured by
using password. The theft information is sent to the owner’s mobile using GSM module. The ultimate design
of the project is in VLSI. FPGA is used to interface these modules.

elevation  is  desired)  and  then  applying  some  good  old
mathematics. Assuming the positions of the satellites are

receiver. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which
is about 186,000 miles per second. So, if the amount of
time it taken by the signal to travel from the satellite to the
receiver is known, then the distance from the satellite to
the receiver (distance = speed x time) can be determined.
If  the  exact  times  of  the  transmission,  reception  of  the
signal are  known,  the  signal's  travel  time  can  be
determined.

In order to do this, the satellites and the receivers use
very accurate clocks which are synchronized so generate
the same code exactly at the same time. The code received
from  the  satellite  can  be  compared  with  the  code
generated by  the receiver. By comparing  the codes, the
time difference between the satellite generated the code
and the receiver generated the code can  be determined.
This interval is the travel time of the code. Multiplying
this travel time, in seconds, by 186,000 miles per second
gives the  distance  from  the  receiver  position  to  the
satellite in miles.

Increased  Accuracy  by  Using  Differential  Gps: A
technique called differential correction is necessary to get
accuracies  within  1  -5  meters,  or  even  better,  with
advanced  equipment.  Differential  correction  requires a
second GPS receiver, which is a base station, collecting
data at  a stationary position  at  a precisely known point
(typically  it  is  a  surveyed  benchmark).  Because  the
physical  location  of  the  base  station  is  known,  the
correction  factor  can  be  computed  by  comparing  the
known location  with  the  GPS  location  determined  by
using the  satellites.  The  differential  correction  process
takes this correction factor and applies it to the GPS data
collected  by  a  GPS  receiver  in  the  field.  Differential
correction eliminates most of the errors listed in the GPS
Error Budget discussed earlier.

Global System for Mobile Communications: The Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the most
popular standard for mobile phones in the world. GSM
service is used by over 2 billion people across more than
212  countries and territories.  The  ubiquity  of the GSM
standard  makes  international  roaming  very  common
between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to
use their phones in many parts of the world. GSM differs
significantly from its predecessors in that both signaling
and speech channels are Digital call quality, which means
that  it  is  considered  a  second  generation  (2G)  mobile
phone system. From the point of view of the consumers,
the  key  advantage  of  GSM  systems  has  been  higher
digital voice quality and low cost alternatives to making
calls such as text messaging Like other cellular standards

GSM allows network operators to offer roaming services
which mean subscribers can use their phones all over the
world.

The modulation used in GSM is Gaussian minimum
shift  keying  (GMSK),  a  kind  of  continuous-phase
frequency  shift  keying.  In  GMSK,  the  signal  to  be
modulated  onto  the  carrier  is  first  smoothed  with a
Gaussian low-pass filter prior to being fed to a frequency
modulator,  which  greatly  reduces  the  interference  to
neighboring channels (adjacent channel interference).

Radio Frequency Communication: RF itself has become
synonymous  with  wireless  and  high-frequency  signals,
describing anything from AM radio between 535 kHz and
1605 kHz to computer local area networks (LANs) at 2.4
GHz. However, RF has traditionally defined frequencies
from  a few  kHz  to  roughly  1  GHz.  If  one  considers
microwave frequencies as RF, this range extends to 300
GHz. A wave or sinusoid can be completely described by
either its frequency or its wavelength. They are inversely
proportional  to  each  other  and  related  to  the  speed  of
light 
through  a  particular  medium.  As  frequency
increases, wavelength decreases. For reference, a 1 GHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 1 foot and a 100 MHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 10 feet.

Operation  at  Higher  Frequencies:  Typically,  data  is
structured and easily represented at low frequencies; how
can  we  represent  it  or  physically  translate  it  to  these
higher RF frequencies? For example, the human audible
range is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. According to the Nyquist
theorem, we can completely represent the human audible
range by sampling at 40 kHz or, more precisely, at 44.1 kHz
(this  is  where  stereo  audio  is  sampled).  Cell  phones,
however, operate at around 850 MHz.

Field-programmable Gate Array: A field programmable
gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an  integrated  circuit  (IC)  that
includes a two-dimensional array of general-purpose logic
circuits, called cells or logic blocks, whose functions are
programmable.  The  cells  are  linked  to  one  another  by
programmable  buses.  A  field-programmable  gate  array
comprises any number of logic modules, an interconnect
routing architecture and programmable elements that may
be  programmed  to  selectively  interconnect  the  logic
modules to one another and to define the functions of the
logic modules. The basic device architecture of an FPGA
consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
embedded  in  a  configurable  interconnect  structure  and
surrounded by configurable I/O blocks (IOBs). An IOB
allows  signals  to be driven off-chip or optionally brought

onto the FPGA onto interconnect segments. The IOB can
typically  perform  other  functions,  such  as  tri-stating
outputs  and  registering  incoming  or  out-going  signals.
The  configurable  interconnect  structure  allows  users  to
implement multi-level logic designs. In addition, FPGAs
typically include other specialized blocks, such as block
random  access  memories  (BRAMs)  and  digital  signal
processors (DSPs). These specialized blocks perform more
specific tasks than the CLBs, but can still be configured
in accordance with a variety of options to enable flexible
operation of the FPGA. Field programmable gate arrays
may be classified in one of two categories. One category
of  FPGA  devices  is  one-time  programmable  and  uses
elements  such  as  antifuses  for  making  programmable
connections.  The  other  category  of  FPGA  devices  is
reprogrammable  and  uses  devices  such  as  transistor
switches as  the  programmable  elements  to  make  non-
permanent  programmable  connections.  An  FPGA  can
support  hundreds  of 
logic
operating  at  system  speeds  of  tens  of  megahertz.  To
implement  a  particular  circuit  function,  the  circuit  is
mapped into the array and the appropriate    programmable
elements  are  programmed  to  implement  the  necessary
wiring connections that form the user circuit. The FPGA
is  programmed  by  loading  programming  data  into  the
memory cells controlling the configurable logic blocks, I/O
blocks and interconnect structure.

thousands  of  gates  of 

A field-programmable  gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an
integrated  circuit  designed  to  be  configured  by  the
customer   or    designer    after    manufacturing—hence
"field-programmable".  The  FPGA  configuration 
is
generally specified using a hardware description language
(HDL),  similar  to  that  used  for  an  application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) (circuit diagrams were previously
used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs,
but  this  is  increasingly  rare).  FPGAs  can  be  used  to
implement  any  logical  function  that  an  ASIC  could
perform.  The  ability  to  update  the  functionality  after
shipping  and  the  low  non-recurring  engineering  costs
relative    to    an  ASIC  design  (not  withstanding  the
generally  higher  unit  cost),  offer  advantages  for  many
applications.

that  allow 

the  blocks 

FPGAs contain  programmable  logic  components
called  "logic  blocks"  and  a  hierarchy  of  reconfigurable
interconnects 
to  be  "wired
together"—somewhat  like  a  one-chip  programmable
breadboard. Logic blocks can  be configured  to perform
complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic
gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks
also include memory elements,  which  may  be  simple
flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.

FPGA  Comparisons:  Historically,  FPGAs  have  been
slower, less energy efficient and generally achieved less
functionality  than  their  fixed  ASIC  counterparts. A
combination  of  volume,  fabrication 
improvements,
research and development and the I/O capabilities of new
supercomputers have largely closed the performance gap
between ASICs and FPGAs.

Advantages include a shorter time to market, ability
to re-program  in  the  field  to  fix  bugs  and  lower  non-
recurring  engineering  costs.  Vendors  can  also  take a
middle  road  by  developing  their  hardware  on  ordinary
FPGAs, but manufacture their final version so it can no
longer be modified after the design has been committed.

Xilinx  claims  that  several  market  and  technology

dynamics are changing the ASIC/FPGA paradigm:

IC costs are rising aggressively
ASIC complexity has bolstered development time and
costs
R&D resources and headcount is decreasing
Revenue 
increasing
Financial constraints in a poor economy are driving
low-cost technologies.

time-to-market  are

for  slow 

losses 

These trends make FPGAs a better alternative than
ASICs 
for  a  growing  number  of  higher-volume
applications than they have been historically used for, to
which  the  company  attributes  the  growing  number  of
FPGA design starts Some FPGAs have the capability of
partial re-configuration that lets one portion of the device
be re-programmed while other portions continue running.

.

FPGA versus CPLDs: The primary differences between
CPLDs and  FPGAs  are  architectural.  A  CPLD  has a
somewhat restrictive structure consisting of one or more
programmable  sum-of-products  logic  arrays  feeding a
relatively small number of clocked registers. The result of
this is  less  flexibility,  with  the  advantage  of  more
predictable 
logic-to-
interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other
hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far
more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are
practical for implementation within them) but also far more
complex to design for.

timing  delays  and  a  higher 

Another  notable  difference  between  CPLDs  and
FPGAs  is  the  presence  in  most  FPGAs  of  higher-level
embedded functions (such as adders and multipliers) and
embedded  memories,  as  well  as  to  have  logic  blocks
implement decoders or mathematical functions.

Abstract: VLSI based Accident information and car security system deals with the concern of saving the victim,
who gets trapped in accident and also about the car security. Accident of the car is detected using pressor
sensors which are fixed in car. Accident information to the nearest hospital is carried out with the help of RF
communication. The location of the car is found using the GPS technique. The security of car is ensured by
using password. The theft information is sent to the owner’s mobile using GSM module. The ultimate design
of the project is in VLSI. FPGA is used to interface these modules.

The drawback of these methods is that they fail to provide
almost  the  higher  security  to  the  car.  Similarly  there  is
only    manual    information  of  accident  to  the  hospital.
There is no automatic accident information system. So our
work  fulfils  these  requirements.  Our  system  uses  the

Global  Positioning  System:  The  Global  Positioning
System  (GPS) 
location  system  based  on a
constellation of about 24  satellites  orbiting  the  earth  at
altitudes  of  approximately  11,000  miles.  GPS  was
developed by  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense
(DOD),  for  its  tremendous  application  as  a  military
locating utility. GPS has proven to be a useful  tool
in
non-military mapping applications as well. GPS satellites
are orbited high enough to avoid the problems associated
with  land  based  systems,  yet  it  can  provide  accurate
positioning  24  hours  a  day,  anywhere  in  the  world.
Uncorrected  positions  determined  from  GPS  satellite
signals  produce  accuracies  in  the  range  of  50  to  100
meters.  When  using  a  differential  correction  technique,
the users  can  get  accurate  positions  within  5  meters  or
less [1].

Triangulation: In  a nutshell, GPS is  based on satellite
ranging - calculating the distances between the receiver
and  the  position  of  3  or  more  satellites  (4  or  more  if
elevation  is  desired)  and  then  applying  some  good  old
mathematics. Assuming the positions of the satellites are
known, the location of the receiver can be calculated by
determining the distance from each of the satellites to the
receiver. GPS takes these 3 or more known references and
measured  distances  and  "triangulates"  an  additional
position [2].

Location Determination by GPS Satellites: GPS satellites
are  orbiting  the  Earth  at  an  altitude  of  11,000 miles.
The DOD can predict the paths of the satellites vs. time
with  great  accuracy.  Furthermore,  the  satellites  can  be
periodically adjusted by huge land-based radar systems.
Therefore, the orbits and the locations of the satellites, are
known in advance. Today's GPS receivers store this orbit
information  for  all  the  GPS  satellites  in  an  almanac.
Consider the almanac as a "bus schedule" advising you
about  the position  of  each  satellite at  a particular  time.
Each  GPS  satellite  continually  broadcasts  the  almanac.
The  GPS  receiver  will  automatically  collect 
this
information and store it for future reference [3].

Calculation of the Position from the Gps Satellites: GPS
determines the distance between a GPS satellite and a GPS
receiver by measuring the amount of time taken by a radio
signal  (the  GPS  signal)  to  travel from the satellite to the

receiver. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which
is about 186,000 miles per second. So, if the amount of
time it taken by the signal to travel from the satellite to the
receiver is known, then the distance from the satellite to
the receiver (distance = speed x time) can be determined.
If  the  exact  times  of  the  transmission,  reception  of  the
signal are  known,  the  signal's  travel  time  can  be
determined.

In order to do this, the satellites and the receivers use
very accurate clocks which are synchronized so generate
the same code exactly at the same time. The code received
from  the  satellite  can  be  compared  with  the  code
generated by  the receiver. By comparing  the codes, the
time difference between the satellite generated the code
and the receiver generated the code can  be determined.
This interval is the travel time of the code. Multiplying
this travel time, in seconds, by 186,000 miles per second
gives the  distance  from  the  receiver  position  to  the
satellite in miles.

Increased  Accuracy  by  Using  Differential  Gps: A
technique called differential correction is necessary to get
accuracies  within  1  -5  meters,  or  even  better,  with
advanced  equipment.  Differential  correction  requires a
second GPS receiver, which is a base station, collecting
data at  a stationary position  at  a precisely known point
(typically  it  is  a  surveyed  benchmark).  Because  the
physical  location  of  the  base  station  is  known,  the
correction  factor  can  be  computed  by  comparing  the
known location  with  the  GPS  location  determined  by
using the  satellites.  The  differential  correction  process
takes this correction factor and applies it to the GPS data
collected  by  a  GPS  receiver  in  the  field.  Differential
correction eliminates most of the errors listed in the GPS
Error Budget discussed earlier.

Global System for Mobile Communications: The Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the most
popular standard for mobile phones in the world. GSM
service is used by over 2 billion people across more than
212  countries and territories.  The  ubiquity  of the GSM
standard  makes  international  roaming  very  common
between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to
use their phones in many parts of the world. GSM differs
significantly from its predecessors in that both signaling
and speech channels are Digital call quality, which means
that  it  is  considered  a  second  generation  (2G)  mobile
phone system. From the point of view of the consumers,
the  key  advantage  of  GSM  systems  has  been  higher
digital voice quality and low cost alternatives to making
calls such as text messaging Like other cellular standards

GSM allows network operators to offer roaming services
which mean subscribers can use their phones all over the
world.

The modulation used in GSM is Gaussian minimum
shift  keying  (GMSK),  a  kind  of  continuous-phase
frequency  shift  keying.  In  GMSK,  the  signal  to  be
modulated  onto  the  carrier  is  first  smoothed  with a
Gaussian low-pass filter prior to being fed to a frequency
modulator,  which  greatly  reduces  the  interference  to
neighboring channels (adjacent channel interference).

Radio Frequency Communication: RF itself has become
synonymous  with  wireless  and  high-frequency  signals,
describing anything from AM radio between 535 kHz and
1605 kHz to computer local area networks (LANs) at 2.4
GHz. However, RF has traditionally defined frequencies
from  a few  kHz  to  roughly  1  GHz.  If  one  considers
microwave frequencies as RF, this range extends to 300
GHz. A wave or sinusoid can be completely described by
either its frequency or its wavelength. They are inversely
proportional  to  each  other  and  related  to  the  speed  of
light 
through  a  particular  medium.  As  frequency
increases, wavelength decreases. For reference, a 1 GHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 1 foot and a 100 MHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 10 feet.

Operation  at  Higher  Frequencies:  Typically,  data  is
structured and easily represented at low frequencies; how
can  we  represent  it  or  physically  translate  it  to  these
higher RF frequencies? For example, the human audible
range is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. According to the Nyquist
theorem, we can completely represent the human audible
range by sampling at 40 kHz or, more precisely, at 44.1 kHz
(this  is  where  stereo  audio  is  sampled).  Cell  phones,
however, operate at around 850 MHz.

Field-programmable Gate Array: A field programmable
gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an  integrated  circuit  (IC)  that
includes a two-dimensional array of general-purpose logic
circuits, called cells or logic blocks, whose functions are
programmable.  The  cells  are  linked  to  one  another  by
programmable  buses.  A  field-programmable  gate  array
comprises any number of logic modules, an interconnect
routing architecture and programmable elements that may
be  programmed  to  selectively  interconnect  the  logic
modules to one another and to define the functions of the
logic modules. The basic device architecture of an FPGA
consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
embedded  in  a  configurable  interconnect  structure  and
surrounded by configurable I/O blocks (IOBs). An IOB
allows  signals  to be driven off-chip or optionally brought

1018

Middle-East J. Sci. Res., 20 (8): 1017-1022, 2014

onto the FPGA onto interconnect segments. The IOB can
typically  perform  other  functions,  such  as  tri-stating
outputs  and  registering  incoming  or  out-going  signals.
The  configurable  interconnect  structure  allows  users  to
implement multi-level logic designs. In addition, FPGAs
typically include other specialized blocks, such as block
random  access  memories  (BRAMs)  and  digital  signal
processors (DSPs). These specialized blocks perform more
specific tasks than the CLBs, but can still be configured
in accordance with a variety of options to enable flexible
operation of the FPGA. Field programmable gate arrays
may be classified in one of two categories. One category
of  FPGA  devices  is  one-time  programmable  and  uses
elements  such  as  antifuses  for  making  programmable
connections.  The  other  category  of  FPGA  devices  is
reprogrammable  and  uses  devices  such  as  transistor
switches as  the  programmable  elements  to  make  non-
permanent  programmable  connections.  An  FPGA  can
support  hundreds  of 
logic
operating  at  system  speeds  of  tens  of  megahertz.  To
implement  a  particular  circuit  function,  the  circuit  is
mapped into the array and the appropriate    programmable
elements  are  programmed  to  implement  the  necessary
wiring connections that form the user circuit. The FPGA
is  programmed  by  loading  programming  data  into  the
memory cells controlling the configurable logic blocks, I/O
blocks and interconnect structure.

thousands  of  gates  of 

A field-programmable  gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an
integrated  circuit  designed  to  be  configured  by  the
customer   or    designer    after    manufacturing—hence
"field-programmable".  The  FPGA  configuration 
is
generally specified using a hardware description language
(HDL),  similar  to  that  used  for  an  application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) (circuit diagrams were previously
used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs,
but  this  is  increasingly  rare).  FPGAs  can  be  used  to
implement  any  logical  function  that  an  ASIC  could
perform.  The  ability  to  update  the  functionality  after
shipping  and  the  low  non-recurring  engineering  costs
relative    to    an  ASIC  design  (not  withstanding  the
generally  higher  unit  cost),  offer  advantages  for  many
applications.

that  allow 

the  blocks 

FPGAs contain  programmable  logic  components
called  "logic  blocks"  and  a  hierarchy  of  reconfigurable
interconnects 
to  be  "wired
together"—somewhat  like  a  one-chip  programmable
breadboard. Logic blocks can  be configured  to perform
complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic
gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks
also include memory elements,  which  may  be  simple
flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.

FPGA  Comparisons:  Historically,  FPGAs  have  been
slower, less energy efficient and generally achieved less
functionality  than  their  fixed  ASIC  counterparts. A
combination  of  volume,  fabrication 
improvements,
research and development and the I/O capabilities of new
supercomputers have largely closed the performance gap
between ASICs and FPGAs.

Advantages include a shorter time to market, ability
to re-program  in  the  field  to  fix  bugs  and  lower  non-
recurring  engineering  costs.  Vendors  can  also  take a
middle  road  by  developing  their  hardware  on  ordinary
FPGAs, but manufacture their final version so it can no
longer be modified after the design has been committed.

Xilinx  claims  that  several  market  and  technology

dynamics are changing the ASIC/FPGA paradigm:

IC costs are rising aggressively
ASIC complexity has bolstered development time and
costs
R&D resources and headcount is decreasing
Revenue 
increasing
Financial constraints in a poor economy are driving
low-cost technologies.

time-to-market  are

for  slow 

losses 

These trends make FPGAs a better alternative than
ASICs 
for  a  growing  number  of  higher-volume
applications than they have been historically used for, to
which  the  company  attributes  the  growing  number  of
FPGA design starts Some FPGAs have the capability of
partial re-configuration that lets one portion of the device
be re-programmed while other portions continue running.

.

FPGA versus CPLDs: The primary differences between
CPLDs and  FPGAs  are  architectural.  A  CPLD  has a
somewhat restrictive structure consisting of one or more
programmable  sum-of-products  logic  arrays  feeding a
relatively small number of clocked registers. The result of
this is  less  flexibility,  with  the  advantage  of  more
predictable 
logic-to-
interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other
hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far
more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are
practical for implementation within them) but also far more
complex to design for.

timing  delays  and  a  higher 

Another  notable  difference  between  CPLDs  and
FPGAs  is  the  presence  in  most  FPGAs  of  higher-level
embedded functions (such as adders and multipliers) and
embedded  memories,  as  well  as  to  have  logic  blocks
implement decoders or mathematical functions.

Security  Considerations:  With  respect  to  security,
FPGAs  have  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  as
compared to ASICs or secure microprocessors.  FPGAs'
flexibility makes malicious modifications during fabrication
a  lower  risk.For  many  FPGAs,  the  loaded  design  is
exposed while it is loaded (typically on every power-on).
To  address  this  issue,  some  FPGAs  support  bitstream
encryption.

Applications  of  FPGAs:  FPGAs  have  gained  rapid
acceptance  and  growth  over  the  past  decade  because
they can be applied to a very wide range of applications.
A list  of  typical  applications  includes:  random  logic
integrating multiple  SPLDs, 
controllers,
communication encoding and filtering, small to medium
sized systems with  SRAM   blocks  and  many  more.
Other interesting applications of FPGAs are prototyping
of designs later to be implemented in gate arrays and also
emulation of entire large hardware systems.

Universalasynchronous  Receiver/Transmitter: A
universal  asynchronous  receiver/transmitter  (usually
abbreviated UART) 
type  of  "asynchronous
receiver/transmitter", a piece of computer hardware that
translates data between parallel and serial forms. A UART
is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit
used  for  serial  communications  over  a  computer  or
peripheral device serial port. UARTs are now commonly
included in microcontrollers. A dual UART or DUART
combines two UARTs into a single chip. Many modern
ICs now come with a UART that can also communicate
these  devices  are  called USARTs
synchronously; 
(universal /asynchronous receiver/transmitter).

Transmitting and Receiving Serial Data: The Universal
AsynchronouReceiver/Transmitter  (UART)  controller  is
the  key  component  of 
the  serial  communications
subsystem of a computer. The UART takes bytes of data
and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.
At the destination, a second UART  re-assembles  the bits
into complete  bytes.  Serial  transmission  of  digital
information (bits) through a single wire or other medium
is  much  more  cost  effective  than  parallel  transmission
through multiple wires. A UART is used to convert the
transmitted information between its sequential and parallel
form at each end of the link. Each UART contains a shift
register which is the fundamental method of conversion
between serial and parallel forms. The UART usually does
not directly generate or receive the external signals used
between different items of equipment. Typically, separate
interface  devices  are  used  to  convert  the  logic  level

signals of the UART to and from the external signaling
levels. External signals may be of many different forms.
Examples of standards for voltage signaling are RS-232,
RS-422  and  RS-485  from  the  EIA.  Historically,  the
presence  or  absence  of  current  (in  current  loops)  was
used in telegraph circuits. Some  signaling  schemes do
not  use  electrical  wires. Examples of such are optical
fiber, IrDA (infrared) and  (wireless)  Bluetooth  in  its
Serial  Port  Profile  (SPP).  Some  signaling  schemes  use
modulation  of  a  carrier  signal  (with  or  without  wires).
Examples  are  modulation  of  audio signals with phone
line  modems,  RF  modulation with data radios and the
DC-LIN  for  power  line  communication.Communication
may be "full duplex" (both send and receive at the same
time) or "half duplex" (devices take turns transmitting and
receiving).

Asynchronous  Receiving  and  Transmitting: 
In
asynchronous  transmitting,  teletype-style  UARTs  send
a  "start"  bit,  five  to  eight  data  bits,  least-significant-bit
first, an optional "parity" bit and then one, one and a half,
or two "stop" bits. The start bit is the opposite polarity of
the data-line's idle state. The stop bit is the data-line's idle
state and provides a delay before the next character can
start. 
start-stop
transmission). In mechanical teletypes, the "stop" bit was
often  stretched  to  two  bit  times  to  give  the  mechanism
more  time  to  finish  printing  a  character.  A  stretched
"stop" bit also helps resynchronization.  The  parity bit
can  either  make  the  number  of  "one"  bits  between  any
start/stop  pair  odd,  or  even,   or   it   can  be omitted.
Odd parity is more reliable because it assures that there
will always be at least one data transition and this permits
many UARTs 
resynchronize.  Asynchronous
transmission  allows  data  to  be  transmitted  without  the
sender  having  to  send  a  clock  signal  to  the  receiver.
Instead,  the  sender  and  receiver  must  agree  on  timing
parameters in advance and special bits are added to each
word  which  are  used  to  synchronize  the  sending  and
receiving units. When a word is given to the UART for
Asynchronous transmissions, a bit called the "Start Bit"
is added  to  the  beginning  of  each  word  that  is  to  be
transmitted. The Start Bit is used to alert the receiver that
a word of data is about to be sent and to force the clock
in the receiver into synchronization with the clock in the
transmitter. These two clocks must be accurate enough to
not have the frequency drift by more  than  10%  during
the  transmission  of  the  remaining  bits in the word.
(This  requirement  was  set  in  the  days  of  mechanical
teleprinters  and  is  easily  met  by  modern  electronic
equipment).

programmable.  The  cells  are  linked  to  one  another  by
programmable  buses.  A  field-programmable  gate  array
comprises any number of logic modules, an interconnect
routing architecture and programmable elements that may
be  programmed  to  selectively  interconnect  the  logic
modules to one another and to define the functions of the
logic modules. The basic device architecture of an FPGA
consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
embedded  in  a  configurable  interconnect  structure  and
surrounded by configurable I/O blocks (IOBs). An IOB
allows  signals  to be driven off-chip or optionally brought

onto the FPGA onto interconnect segments. The IOB can
typically  perform  other  functions,  such  as  tri-stating
outputs  and  registering  incoming  or  out-going  signals.
The  configurable  interconnect  structure  allows  users  to
implement multi-level logic designs. In addition, FPGAs
typically include other specialized blocks, such as block
random  access  memories  (BRAMs)  and  digital  signal
processors (DSPs). These specialized blocks perform more
specific tasks than the CLBs, but can still be configured
in accordance with a variety of options to enable flexible
operation of the FPGA. Field programmable gate arrays
may be classified in one of two categories. One category
of  FPGA  devices  is  one-time  programmable  and  uses
elements  such  as  antifuses  for  making  programmable
connections.  The  other  category  of  FPGA  devices  is
reprogrammable  and  uses  devices  such  as  transistor
switches as  the  programmable  elements  to  make  non-
permanent  programmable  connections.  An  FPGA  can
support  hundreds  of 
logic
operating  at  system  speeds  of  tens  of  megahertz.  To
implement  a  particular  circuit  function,  the  circuit  is
mapped into the array and the appropriate    programmable
elements  are  programmed  to  implement  the  necessary
wiring connections that form the user circuit. The FPGA
is  programmed  by  loading  programming  data  into  the
memory cells controlling the configurable logic blocks, I/O
blocks and interconnect structure.

A field-programmable  gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an
integrated  circuit  designed  to  be  configured  by  the
customer   or    designer    after    manufacturing—hence
"field-programmable".  The  FPGA  configuration 
is
generally specified using a hardware description language
(HDL),  similar  to  that  used  for  an  application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) (circuit diagrams were previously
used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs,
but  this  is  increasingly  rare).  FPGAs  can  be  used  to
implement  any  logical  function  that  an  ASIC  could
perform.  The  ability  to  update  the  functionality  after
shipping  and  the  low  non-recurring  engineering  costs
relative    to    an  ASIC  design  (not  withstanding  the
generally  higher  unit  cost),  offer  advantages  for  many
applications.

that  allow 

the  blocks 

FPGAs contain  programmable  logic  components
called  "logic  blocks"  and  a  hierarchy  of  reconfigurable
interconnects 
to  be  "wired
together"—somewhat  like  a  one-chip  programmable
breadboard. Logic blocks can  be configured  to perform
complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic
gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks
also include memory elements,  which  may  be  simple
flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.

FPGA  Comparisons:  Historically,  FPGAs  have  been
slower, less energy efficient and generally achieved less
functionality  than  their  fixed  ASIC  counterparts. A
combination  of  volume,  fabrication 
improvements,
research and development and the I/O capabilities of new
supercomputers have largely closed the performance gap
between ASICs and FPGAs.

Advantages include a shorter time to market, ability
to re-program  in  the  field  to  fix  bugs  and  lower  non-
recurring  engineering  costs.  Vendors  can  also  take a
middle  road  by  developing  their  hardware  on  ordinary
FPGAs, but manufacture their final version so it can no
longer be modified after the design has been committed.

Xilinx  claims  that  several  market  and  technology

dynamics are changing the ASIC/FPGA paradigm:

IC costs are rising aggressively
ASIC complexity has bolstered development time and
costs
R&D resources and headcount is decreasing
Revenue 
increasing
Financial constraints in a poor economy are driving
low-cost technologies.

losses 

These trends make FPGAs a better alternative than
ASICs 
for  a  growing  number  of  higher-volume
applications than they have been historically used for, to
which  the  company  attributes  the  growing  number  of
FPGA design starts Some FPGAs have the capability of
partial re-configuration that lets one portion of the device
be re-programmed while other portions continue running.

.

FPGA versus CPLDs: The primary differences between
CPLDs and  FPGAs  are  architectural.  A  CPLD  has a
somewhat restrictive structure consisting of one or more
programmable  sum-of-products  logic  arrays  feeding a
relatively small number of clocked registers. The result of
this is  less  flexibility,  with  the  advantage  of  more
predictable 
logic-to-
interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other
hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far
more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are
practical for implementation within them) but also far more
complex to design for.

timing  delays  and  a  higher 

Another  notable  difference  between  CPLDs  and
FPGAs  is  the  presence  in  most  FPGAs  of  higher-level
embedded functions (such as adders and multipliers) and
embedded  memories,  as  well  as  to  have  logic  blocks
implement decoders or mathematical functions.

Security  Considerations:  With  respect  to  security,
FPGAs  have  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  as
compared to ASICs or secure microprocessors.  FPGAs'
flexibility makes malicious modifications during fabrication
a  lower  risk.For  many  FPGAs,  the  loaded  design  is
exposed while it is loaded (typically on every power-on).
To  address  this  issue,  some  FPGAs  support  bitstream
encryption.

Applications  of  FPGAs:  FPGAs  have  gained  rapid
acceptance  and  growth  over  the  past  decade  because
they can be applied to a very wide range of applications.
A list  of  typical  applications  includes:  random  logic
integrating multiple  SPLDs, 
controllers,
communication encoding and filtering, small to medium
sized systems with  SRAM   blocks  and  many  more.
Other interesting applications of FPGAs are prototyping
of designs later to be implemented in gate arrays and also
emulation of entire large hardware systems.

Universalasynchronous  Receiver/Transmitter: A
universal  asynchronous  receiver/transmitter  (usually
abbreviated UART) 
type  of  "asynchronous
receiver/transmitter", a piece of computer hardware that
translates data between parallel and serial forms. A UART
is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit
used  for  serial  communications  over  a  computer  or
peripheral device serial port. UARTs are now commonly
included in microcontrollers. A dual UART or DUART
combines two UARTs into a single chip. Many modern
ICs now come with a UART that can also communicate
these  devices  are  called USARTs
synchronously; 
(universal /asynchronous receiver/transmitter).

Transmitting and Receiving Serial Data: The Universal
AsynchronouReceiver/Transmitter  (UART)  controller  is
the  key  component  of 
the  serial  communications
subsystem of a computer. The UART takes bytes of data
and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.
At the destination, a second UART  re-assembles  the bits
into complete  bytes.  Serial  transmission  of  digital
information (bits) through a single wire or other medium
is  much  more  cost  effective  than  parallel  transmission
through multiple wires. A UART is used to convert the
transmitted information between its sequential and parallel
form at each end of the link. Each UART contains a shift
register which is the fundamental method of conversion
between serial and parallel forms. The UART usually does
not directly generate or receive the external signals used
between different items of equipment. Typically, separate
interface  devices  are  used  to  convert  the  logic  level

signals of the UART to and from the external signaling
levels. External signals may be of many different forms.
Examples of standards for voltage signaling are RS-232,
RS-422  and  RS-485  from  the  EIA.  Historically,  the
presence  or  absence  of  current  (in  current  loops)  was
used in telegraph circuits. Some  signaling  schemes do
not  use  electrical  wires. Examples of such are optical
fiber, IrDA (infrared) and  (wireless)  Bluetooth  in  its
Serial  Port  Profile  (SPP).  Some  signaling  schemes  use
modulation  of  a  carrier  signal  (with  or  without  wires).
Examples  are  modulation  of  audio signals with phone
line  modems,  RF  modulation with data radios and the
DC-LIN  for  power  line  communication.Communication
may be "full duplex" (both send and receive at the same
time) or "half duplex" (devices take turns transmitting and
receiving).

Asynchronous  Receiving  and  Transmitting: 
In
asynchronous  transmitting,  teletype-style  UARTs  send
a  "start"  bit,  five  to  eight  data  bits,  least-significant-bit
first, an optional "parity" bit and then one, one and a half,
or two "stop" bits. The start bit is the opposite polarity of
the data-line's idle state. The stop bit is the data-line's idle
state and provides a delay before the next character can
start. 
start-stop
transmission). In mechanical teletypes, the "stop" bit was
often  stretched  to  two  bit  times  to  give  the  mechanism
more  time  to  finish  printing  a  character.  A  stretched
"stop" bit also helps resynchronization.  The  parity bit
can  either  make  the  number  of  "one"  bits  between  any
start/stop  pair  odd,  or  even,   or   it   can  be omitted.
Odd parity is more reliable because it assures that there
will always be at least one data transition and this permits
many UARTs 
resynchronize.  Asynchronous
transmission  allows  data  to  be  transmitted  without  the
sender  having  to  send  a  clock  signal  to  the  receiver.
Instead,  the  sender  and  receiver  must  agree  on  timing
parameters in advance and special bits are added to each
word  which  are  used  to  synchronize  the  sending  and
receiving units. When a word is given to the UART for
Asynchronous transmissions, a bit called the "Start Bit"
is added  to  the  beginning  of  each  word  that  is  to  be
transmitted. The Start Bit is used to alert the receiver that
a word of data is about to be sent and to force the clock
in the receiver into synchronization with the clock in the
transmitter. These two clocks must be accurate enough to
not have the frequency drift by more  than  10%  during
the  transmission  of  the  remaining  bits in the word.
(This  requirement  was  set  in  the  days  of  mechanical
teleprinters  and  is  easily  met  by  modern  electronic
equipment).

1020

Middle-East J. Sci. Res., 20 (8): 1017-1022, 2014

After the Start Bit, the individual bits of    the  word
of  data  are  sent, with the Least Significant Bit (LSB)
being  sent  first.  Each  bit  in  the    transmission
is
transmitted for exactly the same amount of time as all of
the  other  bits  and  the  receiver  “looks”  at  the  wire  at
approximately   halfway   through   the   period  assigned
to    each bit   to determine if  the bit is a 1 or a 0. For
example,  if  it  takes  two  seconds  to  send  each  bit,  the
receiver will examine the signal to determine if it is a 1 or
a  0  after  one  second  has  passed,  then  it  will  wait  two
seconds and then examine the value of the next bit and so
on.

The  sender  does  not  know  when  the  receiver  has
“looked” at the value of the bit. The sender only knows
when the clock says to begin transmitting the next bit of
the word. When the entire data word has been sent, the
transmitter  may  add  a  Parity  Bit  that  the  transmitter
generates. The Parity Bit may be used by the receiver to
perform simple error checking. Then at least one Stop Bit
is sent by the transmitter. When the receiver has received
all of the bits in the data word, it may check for the Parity
Bits (both sender and receiver must agree on whether a
Parity Bit is to be used) and then the receiver looks for a
Stop Bit.  If  the  Stop  Bit  does  not  appear  when  it  is
supposed to, the UART considers the entire word to be
garbled  and  will  report  a  Framing  Error  to  the  host
processor when the data word is read. The usual cause of
a Framing Error is that the sender and receiver clocks were
not  running  at  the  same  speed,  or  that  the  signal  was
interrupted.

The start bit is always a 0 (logic low), which is also
called a space. The start bit signals the receiving DTE that
a character code is coming. The next five to eight bits,
depending  on  the  code  set  employed,  represent  the
character. In the ASCII code set the eighth data bit may
be a parity bit. The next one or two bits are always in the
mark (logic high, i.e., '1') condition and called the stop
bit(s). They provide a "rest" interval for the receiving DTE
so that it may prepare for the next character which may be
after the  stop  bit(s).  The  rest  interval  was  required  by
mechanical Teletypes which used a motor driven camshaft
to decode each character. At the end of each character the
motor needed time to strike the character bail (print the
character) and reset the camshaft.

System Design
Accident Information and Car Security System
System Functions:

To start the engine of the car, the password should
be given.
If it is correct, the car will be started normally.
Whenever the engine gets started, the alert message
is sent to the owner’s mobile.
Second attempt will be given incase of misspelt of
password in first attempt.
If  it is continued in second attempt also, the doors
will  be  locked,  buzzer  will  start  to  beep  and  alert
message will be sent to the owner’s mobile.
If the password is given in reverse manner, the theft
information will also be sent to nearest police station.
The accident is detected by the pressure sensors.
GPS  receiver  sends  the  data  via  RF  modem  to  the
nearest hospital.

Regardless  of  whether 

the  data  was  received
correctly  or  not,  the  UART  automatically  discards  the
Start, Parity and Stop bits. If the sender and receiver are
configured  identically,  these  bits  are  not  passed  to  the
host. If another word is ready for transmission, the Start
Bit for the new word can be sent as soon as the Stop Bit
for 
the  previous  word  has  been  sent.  Because
asynchronous data is “self are synchronizing”, if there is
no  data  to  transmit,  the  transmission  line can be idle.
A data communication pulse   can  only  be  in  one of
two states but there are many names for the two states.
When on, circuit closed, low voltage, current flowing, or
a  logical  zero,  the  pulse  is  said  to  be  in  the  "space"
condition. When off, circuit open, high voltage, current
stopped, or a logical one, the pulse is said to be in the
"mark" condition. A character code begins with the data
communication circuit in the space condition. If the mark
condition appears, a logical one is recorded otherwise a
logical zero.

Abstract: VLSI based Accident information and car security system deals with the concern of saving the victim,
who gets trapped in accident and also about the car security. Accident of the car is detected using pressor
sensors which are fixed in car. Accident information to the nearest hospital is carried out with the help of RF
communication. The location of the car is found using the GPS technique. The security of car is ensured by
using password. The theft information is sent to the owner’s mobile using GSM module. The ultimate design
of the project is in VLSI. FPGA is used to interface these modules.

The existing  methods  of  car  security  are,Remote

The drawback of these methods is that they fail to provide
almost  the  higher  security  to  the  car.  Similarly  there  is
only    manual    information  of  accident  to  the  hospital.
There is no automatic accident information system. So our
work  fulfils  these  requirements.  Our  system  uses  the
FPGA as the basic module to interface the GPS, GSM, RF
modules.

Global  Positioning  System:  The  Global  Positioning
System  (GPS) 
location  system  based  on a
constellation of about 24  satellites  orbiting  the  earth  at
altitudes  of  approximately  11,000  miles.  GPS  was
developed by  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense
(DOD),  for  its  tremendous  application  as  a  military
locating utility. GPS has proven to be a useful  tool
in
non-military mapping applications as well. GPS satellites
are orbited high enough to avoid the problems associated
with  land  based  systems,  yet  it  can  provide  accurate
positioning  24  hours  a  day,  anywhere  in  the  world.
Uncorrected  positions  determined  from  GPS  satellite
signals  produce  accuracies  in  the  range  of  50  to  100
meters.  When  using  a  differential  correction  technique,
the users  can  get  accurate  positions  within  5  meters  or
less [1].

Triangulation: In  a nutshell, GPS is  based on satellite
ranging - calculating the distances between the receiver
and  the  position  of  3  or  more  satellites  (4  or  more  if
elevation  is  desired)  and  then  applying  some  good  old
mathematics. Assuming the positions of the satellites are
known, the location of the receiver can be calculated by
determining the distance from each of the satellites to the
receiver. GPS takes these 3 or more known references and
measured  distances  and  "triangulates"  an  additional
position [2].

Location Determination by GPS Satellites: GPS satellites
are  orbiting  the  Earth  at  an  altitude  of  11,000 miles.
The DOD can predict the paths of the satellites vs. time
with  great  accuracy.  Furthermore,  the  satellites  can  be
periodically adjusted by huge land-based radar systems.
Therefore, the orbits and the locations of the satellites, are
known in advance. Today's GPS receivers store this orbit
information  for  all  the  GPS  satellites  in  an  almanac.
Consider the almanac as a "bus schedule" advising you
about  the position  of  each  satellite at  a particular  time.
Each  GPS  satellite  continually  broadcasts  the  almanac.
The  GPS  receiver  will  automatically  collect 
this
information and store it for future reference [3].

Calculation of the Position from the Gps Satellites: GPS
determines the distance between a GPS satellite and a GPS
receiver by measuring the amount of time taken by a radio
signal  (the  GPS  signal)  to  travel from the satellite to the

receiver. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which
is about 186,000 miles per second. So, if the amount of
time it taken by the signal to travel from the satellite to the
receiver is known, then the distance from the satellite to
the receiver (distance = speed x time) can be determined.
If  the  exact  times  of  the  transmission,  reception  of  the
signal are  known,  the  signal's  travel  time  can  be
determined.

In order to do this, the satellites and the receivers use
very accurate clocks which are synchronized so generate
the same code exactly at the same time. The code received
from  the  satellite  can  be  compared  with  the  code
generated by  the receiver. By comparing  the codes, the
time difference between the satellite generated the code
and the receiver generated the code can  be determined.
This interval is the travel time of the code. Multiplying
this travel time, in seconds, by 186,000 miles per second
gives the  distance  from  the  receiver  position  to  the
satellite in miles.

Increased  Accuracy  by  Using  Differential  Gps: A
technique called differential correction is necessary to get
accuracies  within  1  -5  meters,  or  even  better,  with
advanced  equipment.  Differential  correction  requires a
second GPS receiver, which is a base station, collecting
data at  a stationary position  at  a precisely known point
(typically  it  is  a  surveyed  benchmark).  Because  the
physical  location  of  the  base  station  is  known,  the
correction  factor  can  be  computed  by  comparing  the
known location  with  the  GPS  location  determined  by
using the  satellites.  The  differential  correction  process
takes this correction factor and applies it to the GPS data
collected  by  a  GPS  receiver  in  the  field.  Differential
correction eliminates most of the errors listed in the GPS
Error Budget discussed earlier.

Global System for Mobile Communications: The Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the most
popular standard for mobile phones in the world. GSM
service is used by over 2 billion people across more than
212  countries and territories.  The  ubiquity  of the GSM
standard  makes  international  roaming  very  common
between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to
use their phones in many parts of the world. GSM differs
significantly from its predecessors in that both signaling
and speech channels are Digital call quality, which means
that  it  is  considered  a  second  generation  (2G)  mobile
phone system. From the point of view of the consumers,
the  key  advantage  of  GSM  systems  has  been  higher
digital voice quality and low cost alternatives to making
calls such as text messaging Like other cellular standards

GSM allows network operators to offer roaming services
which mean subscribers can use their phones all over the
world.

The modulation used in GSM is Gaussian minimum
shift  keying  (GMSK),  a  kind  of  continuous-phase
frequency  shift  keying.  In  GMSK,  the  signal  to  be
modulated  onto  the  carrier  is  first  smoothed  with a
Gaussian low-pass filter prior to being fed to a frequency
modulator,  which  greatly  reduces  the  interference  to
neighboring channels (adjacent channel interference).

Radio Frequency Communication: RF itself has become
synonymous  with  wireless  and  high-frequency  signals,
describing anything from AM radio between 535 kHz and
1605 kHz to computer local area networks (LANs) at 2.4
GHz. However, RF has traditionally defined frequencies
from  a few  kHz  to  roughly  1  GHz.  If  one  considers
microwave frequencies as RF, this range extends to 300
GHz. A wave or sinusoid can be completely described by
either its frequency or its wavelength. They are inversely
proportional  to  each  other  and  related  to  the  speed  of
light 
through  a  particular  medium.  As  frequency
increases, wavelength decreases. For reference, a 1 GHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 1 foot and a 100 MHz
wave has a wavelength of roughly 10 feet.

Operation  at  Higher  Frequencies:  Typically,  data  is
structured and easily represented at low frequencies; how
can  we  represent  it  or  physically  translate  it  to  these
higher RF frequencies? For example, the human audible
range is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. According to the Nyquist
theorem, we can completely represent the human audible
range by sampling at 40 kHz or, more precisely, at 44.1 kHz
(this  is  where  stereo  audio  is  sampled).  Cell  phones,
however, operate at around 850 MHz.

Field-programmable Gate Array: A field programmable
gate  array  (FPGA)  is  an  integrated  circuit  (IC)  that
includes a two-dimensional array of general-purpose logic
circuits, called cells or logic blocks, whose functions are
programmable.  The  cells  are  linked  to  one  another  by
programmable  buses.  A  field-programmable  gate  array
comprises any number of logic modules, an interconnect
routing architecture and programmable elements that may
be  programmed  to  selectively  interconnect  the  logic
modules to one another and to define the functions of the
logic modules. The basic device architecture of an FPGA
consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
embedded  in  a  configurable  interconnect  structure  and
surrounded by configurable I/O blocks (IOBs). An IOB
allows  signals  to be driven off-chip or optionally brought

onto the FPGA onto interconnect segments. The IOB can
typically  perform  other  functions,  such  as  tri-stating
outputs  and  registering  incoming  or  out-going  signals.
The  configurable  interconnect  structure  allows  users  to
implement multi-level logic designs. In addition, FPGAs
typically include other specialized blocks, such as block
random  access  memories  (BRAMs)  and  digital  signal
processors (DSPs). These specialized blocks perform more
specific tasks than the CLBs, but can still be configured
in accordance with a variety of options to enable flexible
operation of the FPGA. Field programmable gate arrays
may be classified in one of two categories. One category
of  FPGA  devices  is  one-time  programmable  and  uses
elements  such  as  antifuses  for  making  programmable
connections.  The  other  category  of  FPGA  devices  is
reprogrammable  and  uses  devices  such  as  transistor
switches as  the  programmable  elements  to  make  non-
permanent  programmable  connections.  An  FPGA  can
support  hundreds  of

operating  at  system  speeds  of  tens  of  megahertz.  To
implement  a  particular  circuit  function,  the  circuit  is
mapped into the array and the appropriate    programmable
elements  are  programmed  to  implement  the  necessary
wiring connections that form the user circuit. The FPGA
is  programmed  by  loading  programming  data  into  the
memory cells controlling the configurable logic blocks, I/O
blocks and interconnect structure.

implement  any  logical  function  that  an  ASIC  could
perform.  The  ability  to  update  the  functionality  after

to re-program  in  the  field  to  fix  bugs  and  lower  non-
recurring  engineering  costs.  Vendors  can  also  take a
middle  road  by  developing  their  hardware  on  ordinary
FPGAs, but manufacture their final version so it can no
longer be modified after the design has been committed.

Xilinx  claims  that  several  market  and  technology

dynamics are changing the ASIC/FPGA paradigm:

IC costs are rising aggressively
ASIC complexity has bolstered development time and
costs
R&D resources and headcount is decreasing
Revenue 
increasing
Financial constraints in a poor economy are driving
low-cost technologies.

time-to-market  are

losses 

These trends make FPGAs a better alternative than
ASICs 
for  a  growing  number  of  higher-volume
applications than they have been historically used for, to
which  the  company  attributes  the  growing  number  of
FPGA design starts Some FPGAs have the capability of
partial re-configuration that lets one portion of the device
be re-programmed while other portions continue running.

.

FPGA versus CPLDs: The primary differences between
CPLDs and  FPGAs  are  architectural.  A  CPLD  has a
somewhat restrictive structure consisting of one or more
programmable  sum-of-products  logic  arrays  feeding a
relatively small number of clocked registers. The result of
this is  less  flexibility,  with  the  advantage  of  more
predictable 
logic-to-
interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other
hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far
more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are
practical for implementation within them) but also far more
complex to design for.

timing  delays  and  a  higher 

Another  notable  difference  between  CPLDs  and
FPGAs  is  the  presence  in  most  FPGAs  of  higher-level
embedded functions (such as adders and multipliers) and
embedded  memories,  as  well  as  to  have  logic  blocks
implement decoders or mathematical functions.

Security  Considerations:  With  respect  to  security,
FPGAs  have  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  as
compared to ASICs or secure microprocessors.  FPGAs'
flexibility makes malicious modifications during fabrication
a  lower  risk.For  many  FPGAs,  the  loaded  design  is
exposed while it is loaded (typically on every power-on).
To  address  this  issue,  some  FPGAs  support  bitstream
encryption.

Applications  of  FPGAs:  FPGAs  have  gained  rapid
acceptance  and  growth  over  the  past  decade  because
they can be applied to a very wide range of applications.
A list  of  typical  applications  includes:  random  logic
integrating multiple  SPLDs, 
controllers,
communication encoding and filtering, small to medium
sized systems with  SRAM   blocks  and  many  more.
Other interesting applications of FPGAs are prototyping
of designs later to be implemented in gate arrays and also
emulation of entire large hardware systems.

Universalasynchronous  Receiver/Transmitter: A
universal  asynchronous  receiver/transmitter  (usually
abbreviated UART) 
type  of  "asynchronous
receiver/transmitter", a piece of computer hardware that
translates data between parallel and serial forms. A UART
is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit
used  for  serial  communications  over  a  computer  or
peripheral device serial port. UARTs are now commonly
included in microcontrollers. A dual UART or DUART
combines two UARTs into a single chip. Many modern
ICs now come with a UART that can also communicate
these  devices  are  called USARTs
synchronously; 
(universal /asynchronous receiver/transmitter).

Transmitting and Receiving Serial Data: The Universal
AsynchronouReceiver/Transmitter  (UART)  controller  is
the  key  component  of 
the  serial  communications
subsystem of a computer. The UART takes bytes of data
and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.
At the destination, a second UART  re-assembles  the bits
into complete  bytes.  Serial  transmission  of  digital
information (bits) through a single wire or other medium
is  much  more  cost  effective  than  parallel  transmission
through multiple wires. A UART is used to convert the
transmitted information between its sequential and parallel
form at each end of the link. Each UART contains a shift
register which is the fundamental method of conversion
between serial and parallel forms. The UART usually does
not directly generate or receive the external signals used
between different items of equipment. Typically, separate
interface  devices  are  used  to  convert  the  logic  level

signals of the UART to and from the external signaling
levels. External signals may be of many different forms.
Examples of standards for voltage signaling are RS-232,
RS-422  and  RS-485  from  the  EIA.  Historically,  the
presence  or  absence  of  current  (in  current  loops)  was
used in telegraph circuits. Some  signaling  schemes do
not  use  electrical  wires. Examples of such are optical
fiber, IrDA (infrared) and  (wireless)  Bluetooth  in  its
Serial  Port  Profile  (SPP).  Some  signaling  schemes  use
modulation  of  a  carrier  signal  (with  or  without  wires).
Examples  are  modulation  of  audio signals with phone
line  modems,  RF  modulation with data radios and the
DC-LIN  for  power  line  communication.Communication
may be "full duplex" (both send and receive at the same
time) or "half duplex" (devices take turns transmitting and
receiving).

Asynchronous  Receiving  and  Transmitting: 
In
asynchronous  transmitting,  teletype-style  UARTs  send
a  "start"  bit,  five  to  eight  data  bits,  least-significant-bit
first, an optional "parity" bit and then one, one and a half,
or two "stop" bits. The start bit is the opposite polarity of
the data-line's idle state. The stop bit is the data-line's idle
state and provides a delay before the next character can
start. 
start-stop
transmission). In mechanical teletypes, the "stop" bit was
often  stretched  to  two  bit  times  to  give  the  mechanism
more  time  to  finish  printing  a  character.  A  stretched
"stop" bit also helps resynchronization.  The  parity bit
can  either  make  the  number  of  "one"  bits  between  any
start/stop  pair  odd,  or  even,   or   it   can  be omitted.
Odd parity is more reliable because it assures that there
will always be at least one data transition and this permits
many UARTs 
resynchronize.  Asynchronous
transmission  allows  data  to  be  transmitted  without  the
sender  having  to  send  a  clock  signal  to  the  receiver.
Instead,  the  sender  and  receiver  must  agree  on  timing
parameters in advance and special bits are added to each
word  which  are  used  to  synchronize  the  sending  and
receiving units. When a word is given to the UART for
Asynchronous transmissions, a bit called the "Start Bit"
is added  to  the  beginning  of  each  word  that  is  to  be
transmitted. The Start Bit is used to alert the receiver that
a word of data is about to be sent and to force the clock
in the receiver into synchronization with the clock in the
transmitter. These two clocks must be accurate enough to
not have the frequency drift by more  than  10%  during
the  transmission  of  the  remaining  bits in the word.
(This  requirement  was  set  in  the  days  of  mechanical
teleprinters  and  is  easily  met  by  modern  electronic
equipment).

After the Start Bit, the individual bits of    the  word
of  data  are  sent, with the Least Significant Bit (LSB)
being  sent  first.  Each  bit  in  the    transmission
is
transmitted for exactly the same amount of time as all of
the  other  bits  and  the  receiver  “looks”  at  the  wire  at
approximately   halfway   through   the   period  assigned
to    each bit   to determine if  the bit is a 1 or a 0. For
example,  if  it  takes  two  seconds  to  send  each  bit,  the
receiver will examine the signal to determine if it is a 1 or
a  0  after  one  second  has  passed,  then  it  will  wait  two
seconds and then examine the value of the next bit and so
on.

The  sender  does  not  know  when  the  receiver  has
“looked” at the value of the bit. The sender only knows
when the clock says to begin transmitting the next bit of
the word. When the entire data word has been sent, the
transmitter  may  add  a  Parity  Bit  that  the  transmitter
generates. The Parity Bit may be used by the receiver to
perform simple error checking. Then at least one Stop Bit
is sent by the transmitter. When the receiver has received
all of the bits in the data word, it may check for the Parity
Bits (both sender and receiver must agree on whether a
Parity Bit is to be used) and then the receiver looks for a
Stop Bit.  If  the  Stop  Bit  does  not  appear  when  it  is
supposed to, the UART considers the entire word to be
garbled  and  will  report  a  Framing  Error  to  the  host
processor when the data word is read. The usual cause of
a Framing Error is that the sender and receiver clocks were
not  running  at  the  same  speed,  or  that  the  signal  was
interrupted.

The start bit is always a 0 (logic low), which is also
called a space. The start bit signals the receiving DTE that
a character code is coming. The next five to eight bits,
depending  on  the  code  set  employed,  represent  the
character. In the ASCII code set the eighth data bit may
be a parity bit. The next one or two bits are always in the
mark (logic high, i.e., '1') condition and called the stop
bit(s). They provide a "rest" interval for the receiving DTE
so that it may prepare for the next character which may be
after the  stop  bit(s).  The  rest  interval  was  required  by
mechanical Teletypes which used a motor driven camshaft
to decode each character. At the end of each character the
motor needed time to strike the character bail (print the
character) and reset the camshaft.

System Design
Accident Information and Car Security System
System Functions:

To start the engine of the car, the password should
be given.
If it is correct, the car will be started normally.
Whenever the engine gets started, the alert message
is sent to the owner’s mobile.
Second attempt will be given incase of misspelt of
password in first attempt.
If  it is continued in second attempt also, the doors
will  be  locked,  buzzer  will  start  to  beep  and  alert
message will be sent to the owner’s mobile.
If the password is given in reverse manner, the theft
information will also be sent to nearest police station.
The accident is detected by the pressure sensors.
GPS  receiver  sends  the  data  via  RF  modem  to  the
nearest hospital.

Regardless  of  whether 

the  data  was  received
correctly  or  not,  the  UART  automatically  discards  the
Start, Parity and Stop bits. If the sender and receiver are
configured  identically,  these  bits  are  not  passed  to  the
host. If another word is ready for transmission, the Start
Bit for the new word can be sent as soon as the Stop Bit
for 
the  previous  word  has  been  sent.  Because
asynchronous data is “self are synchronizing”, if there is
no  data  to  transmit,  the  transmission  line can be idle.
A data communication pulse   can  only  be  in  one of
two states but there are many names for the two states.
When on, circuit closed, low voltage, current flowing, or
a  logical  zero,  the  pulse  is  said  to  be  in  the  "space"
condition. When off, circuit open, high voltage, current
stopped, or a logical one, the pulse is said to be in the
"mark" condition. A character code begins with the data
communication circuit in the space condition. If the mark
condition appears, a logical one is recorded otherwise a
logical zero.
