Abstract—  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  one 
member  in  the  family  of  Automatic  Identification  and  Data 
Capture (AIDC) technologies and is a fast and reliable means of 
identifying any material object. The  significant  advantage  of  all 
types of RFID systems is the non-contact, non-line-of-sight nature 
of  the  technology.  Tags  can  be  read  through  a  variety  of 
substances such as snow, fog, ice, paint, crusted grime, and other 
visually  and  environmentally  challenging  conditions,  where 
barcodes  or  other  optically  read  technologies  would  be  useless. 
This  project  can  provide  security  for  the  industries,  companies, 
etc. This  security  system  gives  information  about  the  authorized 
and  unauthorized  persons.  Primarily,  the  two  main  components 
involved  in  a  Radio  Frequency  Identification  system  are  the 
Transponder  (tags  that  are  attached  to  the  object)  and  the 
Interrogator  (RFID  reader).  In  this  project,  when  the  card  is 
brought near to the RFID module it reads the data in the card and 
displays on the LCD. The data in the card is compared with the 
data  in  the  program  memory  and  displays  authorized  or 
unauthorized message. The door opens for an authorized person, 
closes for an unauthorized person; it alerts the persons through a 
buzzer. The RFID module indicates a buzzer whenever it reads the 
data from the RFID card.

C. RFID Reader 

RFID  reader,  also  referred  as  Proximity  Coupling  Device 
(PCD) [5], reads tag’s data through  the  RFID  antennas  at  a 
certain  frequency.  Basically,  the  reader  is  an  electronic 
apparatus  which  produce  and  accept  a  radio  signals.  The 
antennas contains an attached reader, the reader translates the 
tag’s  radio  signals  through  antenna,  depending  on  the  tag’s 
capacity.  The  readers  consist  of  a  build-in  anti-collision 
schemes  and  a  single  reader  can  operate  on  multiple 
frequencies. As a result, these readers are expected to collect 
data from tag. For this purpose readers can be connected using 
RS-232,  RS-485  and  USB  cable  as  a  wired  options  (called 
serial readers) and connect to the computer system. Readers 
are electronic devices which can be used as standalone or be 
integrated  with  other  devices  and  the  components/hardware 
like  (1)Power  for  running  reader,  (2)  Communication 
interface,  (3)  Microprocessor,  (4)  Channels,  (5)  Controller, 
(6) Receiver, (7) Transmitter, (8) Memory into it. 

D. Microcontroller 
89c51 microcontroller is of the series of 8051, one of oldest 
yet  commonly  used  microcontroller.  89c51  has  the  less 
complex  features  than  other  microcontrollers  and  it  is  also 
easily  available  and  cheap 
in  comparison  of  other 
microcontrollers. 
 
E. Power Supply 
As shown in the fig.1, the input to the circuit is applied from 
the regulated power supply. The a.c. input i.e., 230V from the 
mains supply is step down by the transformer to 12V and is 
fed to a rectifier. The output obtained from the rectifier is a 
pulsating dc voltage. So in order to get a pure dc voltage, the 
output voltage from the rectifier is fed to a filter to remove any 
a.c  components  present  even  after  rectification.  Now,  this 
voltage  is  given  to  a  voltage  regulator  to  obtain  a  pure 
constant dc voltage. 

 

 

Fig.2 Flow chart of design of the system 

 

The reader is having the RS232 interface so the data will be 
transferred from the transmitter (Tx) pin of reader to the 3rd 
pin i.e transmitted data (TxD) pin of the RS232 port. Then the 
data is taken from TxD pin and is given to the 13th pin of the 
MAX 232 and output is taken from the 12th pin of MAX232 
and  is  given  as  the  input  for  the  microcontroller.  Here 
MAX232 will change standards from RS232 level to the TTL 
level standards. The input is given to the Rxd (P3^0) pin of 
8051  microcontroller.  In  the  microcontroller  there  will  be 
code for the identification of the person and output which is 
either low (0) or high (1). 
The  output  is  taken  from  the  other  port  pins.  The  micro 
controller will check the input data of tag with stored data of 
the authorized person and sets the output pin either to low or 
high. The data from the receiver module is sent to the relay 
which  acts  as  the  switch  to  the  load.  Relay  is  an 
electromechanical device. When the 5v signal is given to the 
circuit  then  magnetic  intensity  will  be  produced  and  this 
magnetic intensity will drive the switch from the NC point to 
the NO and a current passes through the motor and letting it to 
work to open a door.

II.  PROBLEM STATEMENT 

 

The  aim  is  to  identify  the  authorized  and  unauthorized 
persons, by using RFID technology with RFID tag and RFID 
reader,  by  comparing  the  details  of  the  tag  with  the  data 
available in the program memory. 

 
A. Proposed Structure and Design of the System 
As  shown  in  the  fig.2,  the  process  begins  when  RFID  tag 
comes  in  the  range  of  the  RFID  reader  then  the  reader 
transmits the signals to the tag. Then tag will modulate that 
carrier signal with the data present in it. Then this modulated 
signal will be received by the RFID reader.

The reader is having the RS232 interface so the data will be 
transferred from the transmitter (Tx) pin of reader to the 3rd 
pin i.e transmitted data (TxD) pin of the RS232 port. Then the 
data is taken from TxD pin and is given to the 13th pin of the 
MAX 232 and output is taken from the 12th pin of MAX232 
and  is  given  as  the  input  for  the  microcontroller.  Here 
MAX232 will change standards from RS232 level to the TTL 
level standards. The input is given to the Rxd (P3^0) pin of 
8051  microcontroller.  In  the  microcontroller  there  will  be 
code for the identification of the person and output which is 
either low (0) or high (1). 
The  output  is  taken  from  the  other  port  pins.  The  micro 
controller will check the input data of tag with stored data of 
the authorized person and sets the output pin either to low or 
high. The data from the receiver module is sent to the relay 
which  acts  as  the  switch  to  the  load.  Relay  is  an 
electromechanical device. When the 5v signal is given to the 
circuit  then  magnetic  intensity  will  be  produced  and  this 
magnetic intensity will drive the switch from the NC point to 
the NO and a current passes through the motor and letting it to 
work to open a door.

II.  PROBLEM STATEMENT 

 

The  aim  is  to  identify  the  authorized  and  unauthorized 
persons, by using RFID technology with RFID tag and RFID 
reader,  by  comparing  the  details  of  the  tag  with  the  data 
available in the program memory. 

 
A. Proposed Structure and Design of the System 
As  shown  in  the  fig.2,  the  process  begins  when  RFID  tag 
comes  in  the  range  of  the  RFID  reader  then  the  reader 
transmits the signals to the tag. Then tag will modulate that 
carrier signal with the data present in it. Then this modulated 
signal will be received by the RFID reader.

much useful and can be implemented in real time applications 
for recording the attendance. 
By  integrating  both  RFID  and  microcontroller  generates  a 
project  with  wider  boundaries  and  effective  solutions.  The 
system can be improved by increasing the range of reader in 
which the tag can be read. Further improvement can be done 
by using a method in which the tag encrypts its ID and then 
sends to the reader, which will eliminate the capturing of the 
tag IDs and hence cloning the tags.

III.  WORKING OF THE SYSTEM 

The RFID reader is operated with +5v power supply. As soon 
as the supply is given, the reader indicates the user that it is 
ready.  After  giving  supply  to  the  reader,  connect  the  serial 
cable of the reader to the DB-9 Connector of the MAX 232 
IC.  After  the  above  connections  are  over,  a  message  is 
displayed on the LCD as “Welcome to RFID reader”. After 
some delay, a message is displayed as “Starting system” with 
a led blinking for some time till the message is appeared on 
the  LCD.  Then  again  a  message  is  displayed  as  “System 
Ready”  with  a  second  led  blinking  till  the  message  is 
appeared. Now, a message will be continuously appearing as 
“Place the Card” till we place the card into the reader with a 
simultaneous  led  blinking.  After  placing  the  card  near  the 
reader, the reader indicates with a buzzer that a card has been 
accepted. Next if the data is matched with the data existing in 
the  card  and  stored  in  the  code  memory  then  it  displays  a 
message  as  “Authorized”  in  the  first  line  of  the  LCD  and 
“KLU welcomes” in the second line of the LCD. When it is 
matched  then  a  message  is  again  displayed  as  “Door  is 
Opening” along with the stepper motor rotating in clockwise 
direction then a message is displayed as “Please Get In…” 
Then after some time, a message is displayed as “Closing the 
door”  along  with  a  stepper  motor 
in  an 
anti-clockwise direction. Hence in this way we are providing 
security.

IV.  DISCUSSION AND RESULT 

RFID  Based  Gate  Access  Security  System  which  is  able  to 
identify  authorized  persons  and  allow  only  them  was 
successfully developed. The major contribution of this work 
is managing to write a functional code for Microcontroller to 
communicate  with  the  RFID  devices  and  store  authorized 
person’s  data.  This  system  should  be  able  to  minimize  the 
technical  human  error  during  secured  gate  access.  Besides, 
the system also helps user to use paperless environment and 
save the time.     
Methodology in the project can be defined as a collection of 
many  components  which  include  procedures,  techniques, 
tools  and  documentation  aids  that  are  intended  to  help  the 
developer in the development. The use of methodology helps 
to produce a better quality product in terms of documentation 
standards,  acceptability 
to  user,  maintainability  and 
consistency of system. 

V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 

RFID  is  increasingly  used  with  biometric  technologies  for 
security.  The  significant  advantage  of  all  types  of  RFID 
systems  is  the  non-contact,  non-line-of-sight  nature  of  the 
technology. Tags can be read through a variety of substances 
such as snow, fog, ice, paint. Hence, this project can be very
