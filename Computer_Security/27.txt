Abstract

As technology  becomes  more advanced and  modernized;  more  features  are  added to the existing  system
for the purpose of satisfying the increasing security needs of the people. Deploying wireless technologies
for security and control in home offers attractive benefits along with user friendly interface.  In this paper
we present  a smart  security  system  comprises  of Zigbee,  GSM,  Sensors  and  Smartphone  for  Security
monitoring and control, when the user is at remote premises.  Three sensors namely P

IR, vibration and door sensor are installed at windows and doors.  Whenever there is a security breach the
sensors  sends the  signal  to  the  Pic  microcontroller.        The  Max  232  converter  provides  serial  interface
between the microcontroller and the zigbee.  The Zigbee end device then transmits the signal to the Zigbee
coordinator.    The  ZC at  the  control  console  communicates  with  MCU  using  max  232  converters.    MCU
would in turn access and control the GSM module via AT commands and automatically sends SMS to the
owner's mobile phone informing him about the security breach. On receiving the SMS, user can make a
video call using Skype account; Smartphone installed at home will feed us with a live video.  On viewing
the video the user can know whether an intruder has entered or not.  Then accordingly faint gas valve and
door lock can be controlled by the user.  Thus whenever there is an intrusion, our system lets the user to
monitor and control his premises from any part of the world.

Bluetooth  based  home  automation  system,  consisting  of  a  primary  controller and  a  number  of
Bluetooth  sub-controllers.  Each  home  device  is  physically  connected  to  a  local  Bluetooth  sub-
controller.  The  home  devices  communicate  with  their  respective  sub-controller using  wired
communications. From the sub-controller all communications are sent to the primary controller
using  wireless communications.  It  is  desirable  for  each home  device to  have  a  dedicated
Bluetooth module. However, due to the fiscal expense of Bluetooth technology, a single module
is  shared  amongst  several  devices.  This architecture  reduces the  amount  of  physical  wiring
required and hence the intrusiveness of the installation, through the use of wireless technology.
However, the architecture does not completely alleviate the intrusiveness of the installation due to
the incorporation  of  some  wired communications.  Moreover the  sharing  of  a  single  Bluetooth
module between  numerous devices  has  the  disadvantage  of  incurring an  access delay.

Describes the  architecture and  simulation  of  a  GSM  based  remote sensing  and control  system
using FPGA. [4] Explains home automation system using GSM, Internet and speech recognition.
In this system the home gateway is internet which require personal computer (PC). However, it's
hard to  manage PC  and  keep  it  ON  all  the  time.  Also it consumes  more power.  The  system
presented  in [5]  is  an  internet-based  intelligent system  for home power  management  aiming to
reduce energy consumption. This system also uses internet cloud as a home gateway having the
same  limitations as  described earlier.
In  [6]  authors  proposed  a  zigbee  based home  network
configuration. This system controls all home appliances through zigbee-infrared combination and
zigbee power adapter.

2. PROPOSED SYSTEM

The project can be splitted into two parts: the hardware part and the software part. The first part
deals about incorporating MCU with sensors, ZigBee architecture, and mobile phone to build a
working circuit that supports portability without compromising reliability, and the second part is
to  make  an  ingenious C-code  for  programming  the  MCU  to  monitor  and  control  secured
environment.

2.1 HARDWARE

The  system  hardware  consists of  ZigBee  EM357module,  Pic  micro  controller, GSM  module, a
smart  phone  with  net connectivity and  corresponding  interfaces. Zigbee  is  a  widely  deployed
standard for providing communication between sensors in low data rate wireless networks.  They
are low cost, low power digital radios for energy efficient and cost effective intelligent devices.  It
is based on IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Networks standard.  It operates in the frequency
range of 2.4 GHZ ISM band and has a data rate of 250 kbps.  The transmission distances range
from  10 
to  100  meters line-of-sight,  depending  on  power  output  and  environmental
characteristics. Zigbee devices can form networks with Mesh, Star and Generic Mesh topologies
among themselves. The network can be expanded as a cluster of smaller networks. A ZigBee
network can have three types of nodes: Zigbee Coordinator (ZBC), Zigbee router (ZBR) and
Zigbee End Device (ZBE) each having some unique property.
In  a  network  there  is  only  one
Coordinator which acts as the main control panel and stores information about the network. Any
end device like lighting units, air conditioning elements etc. can be Zigbee End Devices.  They
communicate only with the coordinator and that is the point where sensors are deployed. A ZBR
is  an  optional  component  used  to  extend  the  coverage.    There  are  two  modes  of  data  transfer
namely Beacon mode and Non Beacon mode.  In Beacon mode, when the devices are not sending
the data they may enter a low power state and reduces the power consumption.  In Non-beacon
mode,  the  end  devices  need  to  be  wake up  only while  sending  the  data  while  the  routers  and
coordinators need to be active most of the time.

The Zigbee module can be installed with any sensor and home appliances as it is very small in
size i.e. 21mm x 37mm, and a low power consuming device.  In the design three sensors namely
PIR sensor, vibration sensor and magnetic door contact sensor are used. While the PIR sensor is
used  for detecting  human  presence,  the  vibration  sensor  and  magnetic  door  contact sensor
installed at  the  windows  and  doors  are  used  for  detecting  window  breaking  and  door  opening.
ZED  is  connected with  door contact  sensor,  PIR  sensor,  and  door  lock system  respectively.
ZigBee node  continuously  checks  input from the corresponding  sensor  and sends  a  wireless
message to the Zc.

The  control  console  which  consists  of  Pic  micro  controller  and  ZC CS2520 module  that  are
mounted on same PCB in our design. ZC is interfaced with MCU using max 232 converters, thus
giving  information  to  MCU about  sensors  status.  Also  ZC  takes  instructions  from  MCU for
actuators using the same interface. MCU is heart of the system. On one hand it is interfaced with
ZC  while  on  the other  hand  it  is  communicating  with  the  GSM module. Mobile  phone  can  be
accessed through its ports using corresponding serial cable. There occurs a serial communication
between MCU and mobile phone. To allow compatibility of data communication between MCU
and mobile phone, an interfacing standard RS-232 was employed. And for this purpose MAX-
232 level converter IC is used. Finally, the GSM module is wirelessly connected with the user
mobile  phone  through  GSM  network. GSM module consists of a GSM modem assembled
together with power supply circuit and communication interface max 232 converters for micro
controller. GSM modem is a device that generates, transmit or decode data from a cellular
network, for establishing communication between the cellular network and the micro controller.
DC  Motors  convert  electrical  energy  (voltage  or power source)  to  mechanical  energy  (produce
rotational motion). They run on direct current. The Dc motor works on the principle of Lorentz
force which states that when a wire carrying current is placed in a region having magnetic field,
than  the  wire  experiences a  force.  When  we  pass  the  input  DC  current  to  the  coil  through  the
brushes,  it  directly  goes  to  the  coil  inside  the  motor  body.  This  makes  coil  to  work  as  an
electromagnet.  Magnetic  fields  of  both  magnets  interact  with  each  other  that  results  in  a  force
which in turn produces the necessary torque required to move the coil. This torque drives the coil
to move round and a shaft attached with the coil moves too. A gas spray is placed in contact with
the shaft. When the DC motor works, the shaft exerts a force on the nozzle of the gas spray and as
a result the gas gets sprayed. Door opening and closing is controlled by means of a relay.

2.2 SOFTWARE

The ZigBee  module  CS2520 is  supported  by  insight  desktop  a  comprehensive  integrated
development environment (IDE) and C-Language compiler tool-chain.  Ember insight desktop is
designed  for  writing,  compiling,  loading  and  debugging  software  on  to  multiple  nodes  in  a
networked environment. Now to connect this chip with the sensors and MCU, max 232 converter
is deployed.  The sensor node EM357 uses a built-in 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor to
control  all  the  interfaces  and  uses  RF  antenna  at  the  end  for  communication  purpose.    The

network, for establishing communication between the cellular network and the micro controller.
DC  Motors  convert  electrical  energy  (voltage  or power source)  to  mechanical  energy  (produce
rotational motion). They run on direct current. The Dc motor works on the principle of Lorentz
force which states that when a wire carrying current is placed in a region having magnetic field,
than  the  wire  experiences a  force.  When  we  pass  the  input  DC  current  to  the  coil  through  the
brushes,  it  directly  goes  to  the  coil  inside  the  motor  body.  This  makes  coil  to  work  as  an
electromagnet.  Magnetic  fields  of  both  magnets  interact  with  each  other  that  results  in  a  force
which in turn produces the necessary torque required to move the coil. This torque drives the coil
to move round and a shaft attached with the coil moves too. A gas spray is placed in contact with
the shaft. When the DC motor works, the shaft exerts a force on the nozzle of the gas spray and as
a result the gas gets sprayed. Door opening and closing is controlled by means of a relay.

2.2 SOFTWARE

The ZigBee  module  CS2520 is  supported  by  insight  desktop  a  comprehensive  integrated
development environment (IDE) and C-Language compiler tool-chain.  Ember insight desktop is
designed  for  writing,  compiling,  loading  and  debugging  software  on  to  multiple  nodes  in  a
networked environment. Now to connect this chip with the sensors and MCU, max 232 converter
is deployed.  The sensor node EM357 uses a built-in 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor to
control  all  the  interfaces  and  uses  RF  antenna  at  the  end  for  communication  purpose.    The

microprocessor is programmed via an ISP header on board to program flash memory of the chip.
On  the  other  hand  Pic  microcontroller is  a  general  purpose  MCU  with  a  rich  set  of  built-in
peripherals. The MCU also features a built-in Flash and EEPROM memories. The flash is used to
store code that is also programmed via the ISP header on the board. For the proposed system, the
MCU  on  one  hand  deals  with  the  ZC  to  receive  intrusion  detection  from  the  sensors  installed
while on the other hand it deals with the GSM module to send Short Message Service (SMS) or to
call the owner. For that purpose searching through answer comes out to be the max 232 converter
for interfaces. Interfacing standards used in this work are summarized in Table 1.

Now  that  it  is  all  set  for  the  communication  between  mobile  phone  and  the  MCU,  in  order  to

These commands come from Hayes commands that were used by the Hayes smart modems. The
Hayes commands started with AT to indicate the attention from the MODEM. The dial up and
wireless MODEMs (devices that
involve machine to machine communication) need AT
commands to interact with a micro controller. These include the Hayes command set as a subset,
along with other extended AT commands. AT commands are used to access and control the built

Abstract

As technology  becomes  more advanced and  modernized;  more  features  are  added to the existing  system
for the purpose of satisfying the increasing security needs of the people. Deploying wireless technologies
for security and control in home offers attractive benefits along with user friendly interface.  In this paper
we present  a smart  security  system  comprises  of Zigbee,  GSM,  Sensors  and  Smartphone  for  Security
monitoring and control, when the user is at remote premises.  Three sensors namely P

IR, vibration and door sensor are installed at windows and doors.  Whenever there is a security breach the
sensors  sends the  signal  to  the  Pic  microcontroller.        The  Max  232  converter  provides  serial  interface
between the microcontroller and the zigbee.  The Zigbee end device then transmits the signal to the Zigbee
coordinator.    The  ZC at  the  control  console  communicates  with  MCU  using  max  232  converters.    MCU
would in turn access and control the GSM module via AT commands and automatically sends SMS to the
owner's mobile phone informing him about the security breach. On receiving the SMS, user can make a
video call using Skype account; Smartphone installed at home will feed us with a live video.  On viewing
the video the user can know whether an intruder has entered or not.  Then accordingly faint gas valve and
door lock can be controlled by the user.  Thus whenever there is an intrusion, our system lets the user to
monitor and control his premises from any part of the world.

INTRODUCTION:

A Security system is considered to be best only if it offers protection and monitoring that guard
against a number of threats, protecting homes against the elements as well as break-in and home
invasions.    A  security  system  should  be  customizable,  provide excellent  monitoring  and  allow
communication  with  the  owner. During recent  past,  a  number  of  systems  were  introduced  for
security measurements based on wired networks. In literature, researchers suggested a number of
security  systems  based on  new technologies 
like  GSM  (Global  System  for Mobile
communication), USN  (ubiquitous  sensors  network)  and implemented  through FPGA  (field
programmable gate arrays), DSP (digital signal processor), and MCU (microcontroller unit). [1]

Bluetooth  based  home  automation  system,  consisting  of  a  primary  controller and  a  number  of
Bluetooth  sub-controllers.  Each  home  device  is  physically  connected  to  a  local  Bluetooth  sub-
controller.  The  home  devices  communicate  with  their  respective  sub-controller using  wired
communications. From the sub-controller all communications are sent to the primary controller
using  wireless communications.  It  is  desirable  for  each home  device to  have  a  dedicated
Bluetooth module. However, due to the fiscal expense of Bluetooth technology, a single module
is  shared  amongst  several  devices.  This architecture  reduces the  amount  of  physical  wiring
required and hence the intrusiveness of the installation, through the use of wireless technology.
However, the architecture does not completely alleviate the intrusiveness of the installation due to
the incorporation  of  some  wired communications.  Moreover the  sharing  of  a  single  Bluetooth
module between  numerous devices  has  the  disadvantage  of  incurring an  access delay.

In this system the home gateway is internet which require personal computer (PC). However, it's
hard to  manage PC  and  keep  it  ON  all  the  time.  Also it consumes  more power.  The  system
presented  in [5]  is  an  internet-based  intelligent system  for home power  management  aiming to
reduce energy consumption. This system also uses internet cloud as a home gateway having the
same  limitations as  described earlier.
In  [6]  authors  proposed  a  zigbee  based home  network
configuration. This system controls all home appliances through zigbee-infrared combination and
zigbee power adapter.

2. PROPOSED SYSTEM

The project can be splitted into two parts: the hardware part and the software part. The first part
deals about incorporating MCU with sensors, ZigBee architecture, and mobile phone to build a
working circuit that supports portability without compromising reliability, and the second part is
to  make  an  ingenious C-code  for  programming  the  MCU  to  monitor  and  control  secured
environment.

2.1 HARDWARE

The  system  hardware  consists of  ZigBee  EM357module,  Pic  micro  controller, GSM  module, a
smart  phone  with  net connectivity and  corresponding  interfaces. Zigbee  is  a  widely  deployed
standard for providing communication between sensors in low data rate wireless networks.  They
are low cost, low power digital radios for energy efficient and cost effective intelligent devices.  It
is based on IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Networks standard.  It operates in the frequency
range of 2.4 GHZ ISM band and has a data rate of 250 kbps.  The transmission distances range
from  10 
to  100  meters line-of-sight,  depending  on  power  output  and  environmental
characteristics. Zigbee devices can form networks with Mesh, Star and Generic Mesh topologies
among themselves. The network can be expanded as a cluster of smaller networks. A ZigBee
network can have three types of nodes: Zigbee Coordinator (ZBC), Zigbee router (ZBR) and
Zigbee End Device (ZBE) each having some unique property.
In  a  network  there  is  only  one
Coordinator which acts as the main control panel and stores information about the network. Any
end device like lighting units, air conditioning elements etc. can be Zigbee End Devices.  They
communicate only with the coordinator and that is the point where sensors are deployed. A ZBR
is  an  optional  component  used  to  extend  the  coverage.    There  are  two  modes  of  data  transfer
namely Beacon mode and Non Beacon mode.  In Beacon mode, when the devices are not sending
the data they may enter a low power state and reduces the power consumption.  In Non-beacon
mode,  the  end  devices  need  to  be  wake up  only while  sending  the  data  while  the  routers  and
coordinators need to be active most of the time.

The Zigbee module can be installed with any sensor and home appliances as it is very small in
size i.e. 21mm x 37mm, and a low power consuming device.  In the design three sensors namely
PIR sensor, vibration sensor and magnetic door contact sensor are used. While the PIR sensor is
used  for detecting  human  presence,  the  vibration  sensor  and  magnetic  door  contact sensor
installed at  the  windows  and  doors  are  used  for  detecting  window  breaking  and  door  opening.
ZED  is  connected with  door contact  sensor,  PIR  sensor,  and  door  lock system  respectively.
ZigBee node  continuously  checks  input from the corresponding  sensor  and sends  a  wireless
message to the Zc.

The  control  console  which  consists  of  Pic  micro  controller  and  ZC CS2520 module  that  are
mounted on same PCB in our design. ZC is interfaced with MCU using max 232 converters, thus
giving  information  to  MCU about  sensors  status.  Also  ZC  takes  instructions  from  MCU for
actuators using the same interface. MCU is heart of the system. On one hand it is interfaced with
ZC  while  on  the other  hand  it  is  communicating  with  the  GSM module. Mobile  phone  can  be
accessed through its ports using corresponding serial cable. There occurs a serial communication
between MCU and mobile phone. To allow compatibility of data communication between MCU
and mobile phone, an interfacing standard RS-232 was employed. And for this purpose MAX-
232 level converter IC is used. Finally, the GSM module is wirelessly connected with the user
mobile  phone  through  GSM  network. GSM module consists of a GSM modem assembled
together with power supply circuit and communication interface max 232 converters for micro
controller. GSM modem is a device that generates, transmit or decode data from a cellular
network, for establishing communication between the cellular network and the micro controller.

The working of the security monitoring and control system is as follows. Three sensors namely

breaking  or  door  opening.    When  the  intrusion  is  detected  by  these  sensors,  it  then  sends  the
signal immediately to the microcontroller.  The micro controller converts the analog signals in to
digital signals for transmitting it to the zigbee.  The zigbee is interfaced with the microcontroller
using the max 232 converter which provides serial communication. The Zigbee end device then
transmits the signal to the zigbee coordinator.  The ZC is interfaced with the microcontroller by
means of max 232 converter. A GSM/GPRS module consists of a GSM modem with standard
communication interface max 232 converter, so that
it can be easily interfaced with a
microcontroller. The power supply circuit is also built in the module that can be activated by
using a suitable adaptor. AT commands are sent by the microcontroller to the GSM module for
communication with the GSM cellular network. Once intrusion is detected, a text message is sent
to the owner indicating security breach. On receiving the text message, the user can use the
Skype account
in the mobile phone for making a video call. The Smartphone with net
connectivity, present in the home feeds the owner with a live video. On viewing the video the
user can know whether the intruder is a known person or not. Then the user can communicate
with the system through reply SMS.
If there is a reply SMS from the user, the GSM module
communicates with MCU in the same manner, but in reverse direction. The mobile phone number
is  first scanned,  if  it  is  authorized,  then further  communication  is  made. Then accordingly the
owner can control the faint gas valve and lock the door. The faint gas valve is activated by SMS
sent by the owner, the DC motor starts working. The shaft of the DC motor exerts a force on the
gas sprayer and as a result the gas starts spraying throughout the room. Then finally the user can
lock the door by sending the corresponding command to the GSM module. Thus the system is
not only used for monitoring but also for controlling purpose ensuring the reliability and safety of
home.

which in turn produces the necessary torque required to move the coil. This torque drives the coil
to move round and a shaft attached with the coil moves too. A gas spray is placed in contact with
the shaft. When the DC motor works, the shaft exerts a force on the nozzle of the gas spray and as
a result the gas gets sprayed. Door opening and closing is controlled by means of a relay.

2.2 SOFTWARE

The ZigBee  module  CS2520 is  supported  by  insight  desktop  a  comprehensive  integrated
development environment (IDE) and C-Language compiler tool-chain.  Ember insight desktop is
designed  for  writing,  compiling,  loading  and  debugging  software  on  to  multiple  nodes  in  a
networked environment. Now to connect this chip with the sensors and MCU, max 232 converter
is deployed.  The sensor node EM357 uses a built-in 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor to
control  all  the  interfaces  and  uses  RF  antenna  at  the  end  for  communication  purpose.    The

175

microprocessor is programmed via an ISP header on board to program flash memory of the chip.
On  the  other  hand  Pic  microcontroller is  a  general  purpose  MCU  with  a  rich  set  of  built-in
peripherals. The MCU also features a built-in Flash and EEPROM memories. The flash is used to
store code that is also programmed via the ISP header on the board. For the proposed system, the
MCU  on  one  hand  deals  with  the  ZC  to  receive  intrusion  detection  from  the  sensors  installed
while on the other hand it deals with the GSM module to send Short Message Service (SMS) or to
call the owner. For that purpose searching through answer comes out to be the max 232 converter
for interfaces. Interfacing standards used in this work are summarized in Table 1.

Now  that  it  is  all  set  for  the  communication  between  mobile  phone  and  the  MCU,  in  order  to
control  the  mobile  phone  through  its  ports,  we  used  AT  Commands,  provided  by  the  vendor
companies. AT commands are used to control MODEMs. AT is the abbreviation for Attention.
These commands come from Hayes commands that were used by the Hayes smart modems. The
Hayes commands started with AT to indicate the attention from the MODEM. The dial up and
wireless MODEMs (devices that
involve machine to machine communication) need AT
commands to interact with a micro controller. These include the Hayes command set as a subset,
along with other extended AT commands. AT commands are used to access and control the built
in  modem  of  the  mobile  phone.  Table  2  shows  AT -commands that  are  used  in  the  proposed
system.

3. OPERATION

When the user is at remote premises and if there is a security breach then he is informed about it
through SMS.  The user in turn can control the gas valve and door lock through the reply SMS.
The working of the security monitoring and control system is as follows. Three sensors namely
PIR,  vibration  and  magnetic  read  switch  are  used.    Vibration  and  magnetic  read  switch  are
installed at doors and windows. PIR sensor is sensitive to the infrared radiation emitted by human
being and hence used for human detection. Vibration sensor is used for monitoring vibration and
hence  used  for  detecting  window  breaking.    Magnetic  read  switch  is  used  for  sensing  door

breaking  or  door  opening.    When  the  intrusion  is  detected  by  these  sensors,  it  then  sends  the
signal immediately to the microcontroller.  The micro controller converts the analog signals in to
digital signals for transmitting it to the zigbee.  The zigbee is interfaced with the microcontroller
using the max 232 converter which provides serial communication. The Zigbee end device then
transmits the signal to the zigbee coordinator.  The ZC is interfaced with the microcontroller by
means of max 232 converter. A GSM/GPRS module consists of a GSM modem with standard
communication interface max 232 converter, so that
it can be easily interfaced with a
microcontroller. The power supply circuit is also built in the module that can be activated by
using a suitable adaptor. AT commands are sent by the microcontroller to the GSM module for
communication with the GSM cellular network. Once intrusion is detected, a text message is sent
to the owner indicating security breach. On receiving the text message, the user can use the
Skype account
in the mobile phone for making a video call. The Smartphone with net
connectivity, present in the home feeds the owner with a live video. On viewing the video the
user can know whether the intruder is a known person or not. Then the user can communicate
with the system through reply SMS.
If there is a reply SMS from the user, the GSM module
communicates with MCU in the same manner, but in reverse direction. The mobile phone number
is  first scanned,  if  it  is  authorized,  then further  communication  is  made. Then accordingly the
owner can control the faint gas valve and lock the door. The faint gas valve is activated by SMS
sent by the owner, the DC motor starts working. The shaft of the DC motor exerts a force on the
gas sprayer and as a result the gas starts spraying throughout the room. Then finally the user can
lock the door by sending the corresponding command to the GSM module. Thus the system is
not only used for monitoring but also for controlling purpose ensuring the reliability and safety of
home.

CONCLUSION

4.

A novel architecture for a smart security system is proposed and implemented, using the wireless
communication technology ZigBee, wide covered GSM and app installed Smartphone. MCU is
programmed for the system and is the heart of our project.  The use of ZigBee communication
technology helps lower the expense of the system and the intrusiveness of the respective system
installation. The GSM communication provides worldwide coverage, easy and a low cost way of
information interchange. The MCU provides interoperability of ZigBee and GSM and also makes
this system portable and easy to install as the system is embedded.  The system is designed to
provide  a  secure  environment  by  letting  the  user  know  about  the  security  breach  and  who  is
involved in it.  Not only that it also allows the user to control gas valve and door lock.  Thus it
enables the remote user to monitor and control his premises from any part of the world.
