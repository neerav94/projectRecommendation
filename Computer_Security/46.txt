Abstract:  Traditional  Household  Security  Systems  often  require  installation  and  detect  on  the  based  of  opening  doors  and 
windows. In the cases where installation is not possible and/or the area of interest has no door our ultrasonic security system 
will come in handy because it requires no installation, and detects intruders based on their physical presence. Security is an 
important part of home, especially if we are going to share our house with prior strangers without lock on our room door. And 
we  anticipate  that  many  college  students  could  face  similar  problem.  What  is  not  to  love  about  a  device  that  looks  like 
WALL-E scans around for possible intruders? In case of intruders, it sends off sound alarm and alerts the owner via message. 
It is also password protected and could be disabled via the correct password. 

In  this  paper,  a  highly  advanced  ultrasonic and  an  At89c51microcontroller  are  used  to  alert  the  security  personals. 
Ultrasonic  sensor  is  sensitive  to  any  human  movement.  It  detects  infrared  radiation  coming  from  any  alive  body.  At89c51 
microcontroller  is  used  for main  module.  In  activated  condition,  when  an  intruder  enters  the  prohibited  area,  sensor  trigger 
main module zones, which in turn sends the message to the central camp and a visual and audible alert is produced. Security is 
an important part of home, especially if we are going to share a house with prior strangers without a lock on our room door.

1. Introduction 

that 

the  human  ear  can  detect 

Ultrasound  is  acoustic  (sound)  energy  in  the  form  of  waves 
having  a  frequency  above  the  human  hearing  range.  The 
highest  frequency 
is 
approximately  20  thousand  cycles  per  second  (20,000  Hz). 
This is where the sonic range ends, and where the ultrasonic 
range  begins.  Ultrasound  is  used  in  electronic,  navigational, 
industrial,  and  security  applications.  It  is  also  used  in 
medicine to view internal organs of the body. 
Ultrasound can be used to locate objects by means similar to 
the principle by which radar works. High frequency acoustic 
waves  reflect  from  objects,  even  comparatively  small  ones, 
because  of  the  short  wavelength.  The  distance  to  an  object 
can  be  determined  by  measuring  the  delay  between  the 
transmission  of  an  ultra-sound  pulse  and  the  return  of  the 
echo. This  is the well-known means  by which bats navigate 
in  darkness.  It  is  also  believed  to  be  used  underwater  by 
cetaceans  such  as  dolphins  and  whales.  Ultrasound  can  be 
used in sonar systems to determine the depth of the water in 
a location, to find schools of fish, to locate submarines, and 
to detect the presence of SCUBA divers. [1]

A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion 
–  unauthorized  entry  –  into  a  building  or  area. Security 
alarms  are  used  in  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and 
military  properties  for  protection  against burglary (theft) 
or property  damage,  as  well  as  personal  protection  against 
intruders. Car  alarms likewise  protect  vehicles  and  their 
contents. Prisons also  use  security  systems  for  control 
of inmates. 
 Ultrasonic  signals  are  like  audible  sound  waves,  except  the 
frequencies are much higher. The ultrasonic transducers have 
piezoelectric crystals which resonate to a preferred frequency 
and  convert  electric  energy  into  acoustic  energy  and  vice

Figure 1: Ultrasonic Smart sensor 

 

 
The  illustration  in  Figure  2  shows  how  sound  waves, 
transmitted in the shape of a cone, are reflected from a target 
back  to  the  transducer.  An  output  signal  is  produced  to 
perform  some  kind  of  indicating  or  control  function.  A 
minimum  distance  from  the  sensor  is  required  to  provide  a 
time delay so that the “echoes” can be interpreted. 

Figure 2: Basic ultrasonic sensor working 

 

 Variables  which  can  affect  the  operation  of  ultrasonic 
sensing  include:  target  surface  angle,  reflective  surface 
roughness or changes in temperature or humidity. The targets 
can  have  any  kind  of  reflective  form  -  even  round  objects. 
Ultrasonic  sensors  (also  known  as  transceivers  when  they 
both send and receive) work on a principle similar to radar or 
sonar which evaluate attributes of a target by interpreting the 
echoes from radio or sound waves respectively.[4] Ultrasonic 
sensors  generate  high  frequency  sound  waves  and  evaluate 
the  echo  which  is  received  back  by  the  sensor.  Sensors 
calculate  the  time  interval  between  sending  the  signal  and 
receiving  the  echo  to  determine  the  distance  to  an  object. 
This technology can be used for measuring: wind speed and 
direction  (anemometer),  tank  or  channel  level,  and  speed 
through  air  or  water.  For  measuring  speed  or  direction  a 
device uses multiple detectors and calculates the speed from 
the  relative  distances  to  particulates  in  the  air  or  water.  To 
measure  tank  or  channel  level,  the  sensor  measures  the 
distance  to  the  surface  of  the  fluid.  Further  applications 
include: humidifiers, sonar, medical ultrasonography, burglar 
alarms and non-destructive testing. 
 
Systems  typically  use  a  transducer  which  generates  sound 
waves in the ultrasonic range, above 18,000 hertz, by turning 
electrical  energy  into  sound,  then  upon  receiving  the  echo 
turn  the  sound  waves  into  electrical  energy  which  can  be 
measured  and  displayed.  The  technology  is  limited  by  the 
shapes  of  surfaces  and  the  density  or  consistency  of  the 
material.  Foam,  in  particular,  can  distort  surface  level 
readings. [5] 
 
The  history  dates  back  to  1790,  when  Lazzaro  Spallanzani 
first  discovered  that  bats  manoeuvred  in  flight  using  their 
hearing 
than  sight.  Jean-Daniel  Col-Ultrasonic 
Security System lad on in 1826 discovered sonography using 
an  underwater  bell,  successfully  and  accurately  determining 
the  speed  of  sound  in  water.  Thereafter,  the  study  and  re-
search  work  in  this  field  went  on  slowly  until  1881  when

Pierre Curie’s discovery set the stage for modern ultrasound 
transducers. He found out the relationship between electrical 
voltage and pressure on crystalline material. The unfortunate 
Titanic accident spurred rigorous interest into  this field  as  a 
result  of  which  Paul  Langevin  invented  the  hydrophone  to 
detect  icebergs.  It  was  the  first  ultrasonic  transducer.  The 
hydrophone  could  send  and  receive  low  frequency  sound 
waves  and  was  later  used  in  the  detection  of  submarines  in 
the World War 1. [6] 

3. Methodology 

The system uses ultrasonic sensor that has a transmitter part 
and  a  receiver  part.  The  ultrasonic  transmitter  periodically 
emits  ultrasonic  signals  into  an  open  area  in  front  of  it.  To 
cover a wide range, a rotating Stepper Motor is used to allow 
the  sensor  (transmitter  and  receiver  pair)  to  cover  roughly 
180  degrees.  If  the  signal  ever  hits  a physical  object,  it will 
be  reflected  back  and,  the  receiver  part  of  the  sensor  will 
then  capture  it  with  the  object  considered  detected  as  its 
position  (distance  from  the  device  and  angle  relative  to  the 
device) is now known.

As  the  security  system  sends  off  a  signal  to  GSM  Modem 
that  object  detected  using  At89c51  Microcontroller.  Then 
SMS  is  sent  to  an  owner’s  Mobile  in  advance.  From  the 
user’s perspective, here is the flow of the system: when any 
unauthorized  person  enters  in  range  of  sensor  then  security 
system  becomes  active:  motor  starts  rotating,  sensor  is 
scanning for potential intruders within a distance (15 cm for 
our  demo,  but  could  be  anything  realistically.  It  is  only 
constrained  by 
is  5  meters 
theoretically),  and  in  the  case  that  an  object  is  detected;  the 
system  beeps  and  triggers  At89c51  to  send  a  Message 
containing the time of detection to the user. [7] 
This  system  consists  of  a  GSM  modem  for  sending  and 
receiving  the  SMS,  At89C51  microcontroller  which  is 
controlling the entire system, LCD for the display purpose. It 
can be installed at any desired location e.g., office (to protect 
important  files  and  document),  banks  (to  protect  cash  in 
locker)  etc.  In  this  system,  the  authorized  person  will  have 
the  entire  control  and  he  will  decide  which  people  will  be 
allowed in that restricted area. Depending upon the response 
from  the  authorized  person,  microcontroller  will  decide 
whether  to  permit  or  not  open.  The  GSM  modem  provides 
the  communication  mechanism  between  the  user  and  the 
microcontroller system by means of SMS messages. [8]

Step  angle  of  the  stepper  motor  is  defined  as  the  angle 
traversed  by  the  motor  in  one  step.  To  calculate  step  angle, 
simply  divide  360  by  number  of  steps  a  motor  takes  to 
complete one revolution. [9]

Our  sensor  calibration  and  utilization  gave  us  a  distance 
measurement  with  roughly  1.5  cm  accuracy.  Provided  that 
we are using the sensor to detect presence of an object more 
so than the exact distance, this accuracy is tolerable. 
5.2 Speed of detection 
It takes a maximum of three seconds for the system to detect 
a  newly  present  object,  and  to  turn  on  the  alarm.  This  is 
because the servomotor is set to cover 180 degree range, and 
thus it takes roughly 3 seconds for it to start from one angle 
and back. However, a user can easily configure the servo to a 
narrower angle to focus at specific area (such as doorway), in 
which case the sensor will detect newly present object in less 
than a second. 
5.3 Detection accuracy 
Through  our  tests,  we  believe  our  system  is  capable  of 
detecting intruders 95% of the time, provided that sensor was 
placed  at  appropriate  position.  The  few  times  that  intruder 
get  away  are  when  they  are  capable  of  crossing  past  the 
sensor  quicker  than  200  msec,  which  is  our  measurement 
interval hard-coded into our code. 
5.4 Message Notification 
Upon  object  detection,  we  successfully  receive  emails  that 
contain the exact time when the security was triggered. This 
is  a  standard  email  delivery,  and  therefore  it  could  take  a 
minute  or  two  for  it  to  reach  your  inbox.  When  the  object 
continues to be in the way, the system does continue to send 
emails. So far, we have not seen any false positive alerts.

Abstract:  Traditional  Household  Security  Systems  often  require  installation  and  detect  on  the  based  of  opening  doors  and 
windows. In the cases where installation is not possible and/or the area of interest has no door our ultrasonic security system 
will come in handy because it requires no installation, and detects intruders based on their physical presence. Security is an 
important part of home, especially if we are going to share our house with prior strangers without lock on our room door. And 
we  anticipate  that  many  college  students  could  face  similar  problem.  What  is  not  to  love  about  a  device  that  looks  like 
WALL-E scans around for possible intruders? In case of intruders, it sends off sound alarm and alerts the owner via message. 
It is also password protected and could be disabled via the correct password. 

In  this  paper,  a  highly  advanced  ultrasonic and  an  At89c51microcontroller  are  used  to  alert  the  security  personals. 
Ultrasonic  sensor  is  sensitive  to  any  human  movement.  It  detects  infrared  radiation  coming  from  any  alive  body.  At89c51 
microcontroller  is  used  for main  module.  In  activated  condition,  when  an  intruder  enters  the  prohibited  area,  sensor  trigger 
main module zones, which in turn sends the message to the central camp and a visual and audible alert is produced. Security is 
an important part of home, especially if we are going to share a house with prior strangers without a lock on our room door.  
Here  GSM  Modem  is  used  to  send  the  message  to  owners  mobile  when  the  unwanted  person  crosses  the  in  the  prohibited 
area. It is also password protected and could be disabled via the correct password.

1. Introduction 

that 

the  human  ear  can  detect 

Ultrasound  is  acoustic  (sound)  energy  in  the  form  of  waves 
having  a  frequency  above  the  human  hearing  range.  The 
highest  frequency 
is 
approximately  20  thousand  cycles  per  second  (20,000  Hz). 
This is where the sonic range ends, and where the ultrasonic 
range  begins.  Ultrasound  is  used  in  electronic,  navigational, 
industrial,  and  security  applications.  It  is  also  used  in 
medicine to view internal organs of the body. 
Ultrasound can be used to locate objects by means similar to 
the principle by which radar works. High frequency acoustic 
waves  reflect  from  objects,  even  comparatively  small  ones, 
because  of  the  short  wavelength.  The  distance  to  an  object 
can  be  determined  by  measuring  the  delay  between  the 
transmission  of  an  ultra-sound  pulse  and  the  return  of  the 
echo. This  is the well-known means  by which bats navigate 
in  darkness.  It  is  also  believed  to  be  used  underwater  by 
cetaceans  such  as  dolphins  and  whales.  Ultrasound  can  be 
used in sonar systems to determine the depth of the water in 
a location, to find schools of fish, to locate submarines, and 
to detect the presence of SCUBA divers. [1]

alive  body.  At89c51  microcontroller  is  used  for  main 
module.  In  activated  condition,  when  an  intruder  enters  the 
prohibited area, sensor trigger main module zones, which in 
turn sends the message to the central camp and a visual and 
audible alert is produced.[2] Security is an important part of 
home, especially if we are going to share a house with prior 
strangers  without  a  lock  on  our  room  door.    Here  GSM 
Modem is used to send the information  
to  the  camp  when  the  unwanted  person  crosses  the  in  the 
prohibited area. 

2. Literature Survey 

A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion 
–  unauthorized  entry  –  into  a  building  or  area. Security 
alarms  are  used  in  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and 
military  properties  for  protection  against burglary (theft) 
or property  damage,  as  well  as  personal  protection  against 
intruders. Car  alarms likewise  protect  vehicles  and  their 
contents. Prisons also  use  security  systems  for  control 
of inmates. 
 Ultrasonic  signals  are  like  audible  sound  waves,  except  the 
frequencies are much higher. The ultrasonic transducers have 
piezoelectric crystals which resonate to a preferred frequency 
and  convert  electric  energy  into  acoustic  energy  and  vice 
versa. [3]

Figure 1: Ultrasonic Smart sensor 

 

 
The  illustration  in  Figure  2  shows  how  sound  waves, 
transmitted in the shape of a cone, are reflected from a target 
back  to  the  transducer.  An  output  signal  is  produced  to 
perform  some  kind  of  indicating  or  control  function.  A 
minimum  distance  from  the  sensor  is  required  to  provide  a 
time delay so that the “echoes” can be interpreted. 

Figure 2: Basic ultrasonic sensor working 

 

 Variables  which  can  affect  the  operation  of  ultrasonic 
sensing  include:  target  surface  angle,  reflective  surface 
roughness or changes in temperature or humidity. The targets 
can  have  any  kind  of  reflective  form  -  even  round  objects. 
Ultrasonic  sensors  (also  known  as  transceivers  when  they 
both send and receive) work on a principle similar to radar or 
sonar which evaluate attributes of a target by interpreting the 
echoes from radio or sound waves respectively.[4] Ultrasonic 
sensors  generate  high  frequency  sound  waves  and  evaluate 
the  echo  which  is  received  back  by  the  sensor.  Sensors 
calculate  the  time  interval  between  sending  the  signal  and 
receiving  the  echo  to  determine  the  distance  to  an  object. 
This technology can be used for measuring: wind speed and 
direction  (anemometer),  tank  or  channel  level,  and  speed 
through  air  or  water.  For  measuring  speed  or  direction  a 
device uses multiple detectors and calculates the speed from 
the  relative  distances  to  particulates  in  the  air  or  water.  To 
measure  tank  or  channel  level,  the  sensor  measures  the 
distance  to  the  surface  of  the  fluid.  Further  applications 
include: humidifiers, sonar, medical ultrasonography, burglar 
alarms and non-destructive testing. 
 
Systems  typically  use  a  transducer  which  generates  sound 
waves in the ultrasonic range, above 18,000 hertz, by turning 
electrical  energy  into  sound,  then  upon  receiving  the  echo 
turn  the  sound  waves  into  electrical  energy  which  can  be 
measured  and  displayed.  The  technology  is  limited  by  the 
shapes  of  surfaces  and  the  density  or  consistency  of  the 
material.  Foam,  in  particular,  can  distort  surface  level 
readings. [5] 
 
The  history  dates  back  to  1790,  when  Lazzaro  Spallanzani 
first  discovered  that  bats  manoeuvred  in  flight  using  their 
hearing 
than  sight.  Jean-Daniel  Col-Ultrasonic 
Security System lad on in 1826 discovered sonography using 
an  underwater  bell,  successfully  and  accurately  determining 
the  speed  of  sound  in  water.  Thereafter,  the  study  and  re-
search  work  in  this  field  went  on  slowly  until  1881  when

Pierre Curie’s discovery set the stage for modern ultrasound 
transducers. He found out the relationship between electrical 
voltage and pressure on crystalline material. The unfortunate 
Titanic accident spurred rigorous interest into  this field  as  a 
result  of  which  Paul  Langevin  invented  the  hydrophone  to 
detect  icebergs.  It  was  the  first  ultrasonic  transducer.  The 
hydrophone  could  send  and  receive  low  frequency  sound 
waves  and  was  later  used  in  the  detection  of  submarines  in 
the World War 1. [6] 

3. Methodology 

The system uses ultrasonic sensor that has a transmitter part 
and  a  receiver  part.  The  ultrasonic  transmitter  periodically 
emits  ultrasonic  signals  into  an  open  area  in  front  of  it.  To 
cover a wide range, a rotating Stepper Motor is used to allow 
the  sensor  (transmitter  and  receiver  pair)  to  cover  roughly 
180  degrees.  If  the  signal  ever  hits  a physical  object,  it will 
be  reflected  back  and,  the  receiver  part  of  the  sensor  will 
then  capture  it  with  the  object  considered  detected  as  its 
position  (distance  from  the  device  and  angle  relative  to  the 
device) is now known.

As  the  security  system  sends  off  a  signal  to  GSM  Modem 
that  object  detected  using  At89c51  Microcontroller.  Then 
SMS  is  sent  to  an  owner’s  Mobile  in  advance.  From  the 
user’s perspective, here is the flow of the system: when any 
unauthorized  person  enters  in  range  of  sensor  then  security 
system  becomes  active:  motor  starts  rotating,  sensor  is 
scanning for potential intruders within a distance (15 cm for 
our  demo,  but  could  be  anything  realistically.  It  is  only 
constrained  by 
is  5  meters 
theoretically),  and  in  the  case  that  an  object  is  detected;  the 
system  beeps  and  triggers  At89c51  to  send  a  Message 
containing the time of detection to the user. [7] 
This  system  consists  of  a  GSM  modem  for  sending  and 
receiving  the  SMS,  At89C51  microcontroller  which  is 
controlling the entire system, LCD for the display purpose. It 
can be installed at any desired location e.g., office (to protect 
important  files  and  document),  banks  (to  protect  cash  in 
locker)  etc.  In  this  system,  the  authorized  person  will  have 
the  entire  control  and  he  will  decide  which  people  will  be 
allowed in that restricted area. Depending upon the response 
from  the  authorized  person,  microcontroller  will  decide 
whether  to  permit  or  not  open.  The  GSM  modem  provides 
the  communication  mechanism  between  the  user  and  the 
microcontroller system by means of SMS messages. [8]
