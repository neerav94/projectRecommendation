high speed flash memory ranging from 32 KB to 512 KB.

When  a  mobile  station  roams  into  a  new  MSC  area,  the 
VLR  connected  to  that  MSC  will  request  data  about  the 
mobile  station  from  the  HLR.  Later,  if  the  mobile  station 
makes  a  call,  the  VLR  will  have  the  information  needed 
for call setup  without having to interrogate the HLR each 
time.  
  Authentication  centre  (AUC):  A  unit  called  the  AUC 
provides  authentication  and  encryption  parameters  that 
verify  the  user's  identity  and  ensure  the  confidentiality  of 
each  call.  The  AUC  protects  network  operators  from 
different  types  of  fraud  found  in  today's  cellular  world. 
  Equipment  identity  register  (EIR):  The  EIR  is  a 
database  that  contains  information  about  the  identity  of 
mobile  equipment 
that  prevents  calls  from  stolen, 
unauthorized, or defective mobile stations. 
  The  first  commercial  RFID  application  was  the 
Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS). It was developed in 
the seventies as a theft prevention system. It was based on 
tags that can store a single bit. That bit was read when the 
customer left the store and the system would sound alarm 
when the bit was not unset. In the end-seventies RFID tags 
made  its  way  into  the  agriculture  for  example  for  animal 
tagging. 
A RFID reader and a few tags are in general of little use. 
  The retrieval of a serial number does not provide much 
information  to  the  user  nor  does  it  help  to  keep  track  of 
items in a production chain. The real power of 
  RFID comes in combination with a backend that stores 
additional  information  such  as  descriptions  for  products 
and  where  and  when  a  certain  tag  was  scanned.  The 
expected  proliferation  of  RFID  tags  into  the  billions  has 
raised  many  privacy  and  security  concerns.  A  common 
concern is the loss of privacy when companies scan tags to 
acquire  information  about  customers  and  then  using  data 
mining  techniques  to  create  individual  profiles.  This 
section describes possible  scenarios  where RFID tags can 
be  exploited 
technology  becomes  more 
ophisticated and item level tagging promises more control 
and  large  savings  in  the  supply  chain  management, 
companies  are  tagging  items  within  their  production 
process.  Tomaximize  the  benefits  companies  start  to 
require  their  suppliers  to  label  all  items  delivered  to  the 
company. For example, Wal-Mart, Proctor & Gamble, and 
the  US  Department  of  Defense  require  their  suppliers  to 
phase in item-level tagging. 
  The  immobilizer  uses  the  active  RFID  technology 
where  the  tag  is  generated  with  comparatively  large 
character sets. The receiving unit is intelligently integrated 
into  three  control  circuits  in  the  vehicle,  namely,  ignition 
circuit,  power  control  unit,  and  automatic  gear  changing 
system, enabling it to bring the vehicle speed down to zero 
in a safe step by step manner. The anti-theft auto security 
system  proposed  here  was  tested  under  different  weather 
conditions  and  possible  signal  distortion  situations  to 
verify its reliability. 
 
2. Related Work 
 
Many researchers have proposed many theft prevention  
systems.  This  system  contains  new  technologies.  System 
included  in  uses  a  GSM  which  serves  as  an  mediator 

 
3. System Overview 
 
The  system  consists  of  two  main    parts  .The  first  part 
contains  door  control  and  second  part  contains  security 
which  is  provided  to  prevent  the  vehicle,  message 
conveying  ability  to  owner  for  unauthorized  access  with 
correct  vehicle  location  using  GPS  and  GSM  which  uses 
serial communication. 
 
I) Hardware Specification 
 
A.  Microcontroller:  Microcontroller used here is ARM7-
LPC2148  microcontroller.  The  16-bit  Thumb  mode 
reduces  code  by  more 
than  30  %  with  minimal 
performance penalty.  
  B.  GSM:  Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications 
(GSM)  is  the  most  popular  technology  in  the  world. 
Throughout  the  evolution  of  cellular  telecommunications, 
various  systems  have  been  developed  without  the  benefit 
of  standardized  specifications.  This  presented  many 
problems directly related to compatibility, especially  with 
the  development  of  digital  radio  technology.  The  GSM 
standard  is  intended  to  address  these  problems.  SM 
provides  recommendations,  not  requirements.  The  GSM 
specifications  define 
interface 
requirements  in  detail  but  do  not  address  the  hardware. 
The  reason  for  this  is  to  limit  the  designers  as  little  as 
possible  but  still  to  make  it  possible  for  the  operators  to 
buy  equipment  from  different  suppliers.  The  GSM 
network is divided into three major systems: the switching 
system  (SS),  the  base  station  system  (BSS),  and  the 
operation and support system (OSS). 
The  name  GSM  first  comes  from  a  group  called  Group 
Special  Mobile  (GSM).  When  GSM  service  started  in

  RFID comes in combination with a backend that stores 
additional  information  such  as  descriptions  for  products 
and  where  and  when  a  certain  tag  was  scanned.  The 
expected  proliferation  of  RFID  tags  into  the  billions  has 
raised  many  privacy  and  security  concerns.  A  common 
concern is the loss of privacy when companies scan tags to

mining  techniques  to  create  individual  profiles.  This

circuit,  power  control  unit,  and  automatic  gear  changing 
system, enabling it to bring the vehicle speed down to zero 
in a safe step by step manner. The anti-theft auto security 
system  proposed  here  was  tested  under  different  weather 
conditions  and  possible  signal  distortion  situations  to 
verify its reliability.

3. System Overview 
 
The  system  consists  of  two  main    parts  .The  first  part 
contains  door  control  and  second  part  contains  security 
which  is  provided  to  prevent  the  vehicle,  message 
conveying  ability  to  owner  for  unauthorized  access  with 
correct  vehicle  location  using  GPS  and  GSM  which  uses 
serial communication. 
 
I) Hardware Specification 
 
A.  Microcontroller:  Microcontroller used here is ARM7-
LPC2148  microcontroller.  The  16-bit  Thumb  mode 
reduces  code  by  more 
than  30  %  with  minimal 
performance penalty.  
  B.  GSM:  Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications 
(GSM)  is  the  most  popular  technology  in  the  world. 
Throughout  the  evolution  of  cellular  telecommunications, 
various  systems  have  been  developed  without  the  benefit 
of  standardized  specifications.  This  presented  many 
problems directly related to compatibility, especially  with 
the  development  of  digital  radio  technology.  The  GSM 
standard  is  intended  to  address  these  problems.  SM 
provides  recommendations,  not  requirements.  The  GSM 
specifications  define 
interface 
requirements  in  detail  but  do  not  address  the  hardware. 
The  reason  for  this  is  to  limit  the  designers  as  little  as 
possible  but  still  to  make  it  possible  for  the  operators  to 
buy  equipment  from  different  suppliers.  The  GSM 
network is divided into three major systems: the switching 
system  (SS),  the  base  station  system  (BSS),  and  the 
operation and support system (OSS). 
The  name  GSM  first  comes  from  a  group  called  Group 
Special  Mobile  (GSM).  When  GSM  service  started  in

Abstract 
 
A  total  security  system  based  on  Global  System  for  Mobile,  Global  Positioning  System,  Radio  frequency  identification 
technology, in-camera, steering wheel lock is developed to prevent a car from theft. This consists of GSM, GPS, RFID & 
a  sensor.  When  anyone  wants  to  open  the  door  of  vehicle,  it  will  ask  for  correct  RFID  identification.    Accelerometer 
sensor is used to measure any breaking of window & movement of car. When key is inserted, message displays on liquid-
crystal display asking the user to enter thumb impression .If the user fails to enter the correct thumb impression in three 
trials, a text message is sent to the owner’s mobile with vehicle location using GPS. When anyone enters in car, camera 
takes the photo and sends it to the owner. A steering wheel lock is also used for more prevention. Further the connection 
to fuel injector of the car is stopped so that unauthorized person cannot start the vehicle anyhow. 
 
Keywords:  GSM, GPS, RFID, Keil, accelerometer sensor, thumb impression, steering wheel lock. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1 Now-a-days a number of car anti-theft security options are 
available.  But  these  antitheft  devices  are  very  expensive. 
So  there  is  a  need  of  an  excellent  protection  of  vehicle 
with  the  reliable  anti-theft  device.  Car  central  locking 
system gives the best protection .  Again this system could 
not  prove  to  provide  complete  security  of  the  vehicle  in 
case of theft. So a better developed system based on GSM, 
GPS, RFID, camera, steering wheel lock is developed. The 
designed  &  developed  system  can  install  in  the  vehicle. 
GSM  is  used  for  sending  messages.  This  device  uses  the 
ARM  7  microcontroller  which  will  interface  to  other 
peripheral  devices 
reader, 
accelerometer  sensor  etc.  The  accelerometer  sensor  will 
interface  to  microcontroller  which  is  used  to  sense  the 
Vibrations. When vehicle is parked, the accelerometer will 
sense  the  vibrations  or  movement  of  the  car.  When 
vibration goes above a certain limit the SMS will be send 
to  the  owner’s  mobile.  The  vehicle  is  provided  with  the 
RFID  reader.  The  door  assembly  is  developed  using  DC 
motor which would be controlled using the relay. When an 
unauthorized  person  wants  to  open  the  door  of  car  then 
he/she is unable to open without RFID tag. There may be 
possibility  that  the  person  may  break  the  window  of  car, 
accelerometer  will  sense  the  vibrations  and  send  the 
message  to  owner’s  mobile.  After  entering  in  car,  the 
camera will take snap of person and send it to owner, after 
that  user  try  to  start,  but  unable  because  when  key  is 
inserted,  one  message  will  be  displayed  on  LCD  for 

entering  correct  finger–print.  User  will  be  given  three 
trials,  after  third  trial,  message  will  be  send  to  owner’s 
mobile  with  location  of  car  &  alarm  will  on.  After  that  a 
steering  wheel  lock  is  used  here,  so  no  one  can  drive  it 
until  he/she  removes  the  lock.  This  first  section  gives  the 
introductory  part,  second  section  gives  overview  of 
systems designed previously and the proposed system. The 
third  section  gives 
including 
hardware  and  software  specification.  Fourth  section 
includes the conclusion and future scope. 
for 
  The  switching  system 
performing 
and  Subscriber-related 
functions.  The  switching  system  includes  the  following 
functional units:  
  Home location register (HLR): The HLR is a database 
used  for  storage  and  management  of  subscriptions.  The 
HLR  is  considered  the  most  important  database,  as  it 
stores  permanent  data  about  subscribers,  including  a 
subscriber's  service  profile,  location  information,  and 
activity  status.  When  an  individual  buys  a  subscription 
from  one  of  the  PCS  operators,  he  or  she  is  registered  in 
the HLR of that operator 
  Mobile  services  switching  centre  (MSC):  The  MSC 
performs the telephony switching functions of the system. 
It  controls  calls  to  and  from  other  telephone  and  data 
systems.  It  also  performs  such  functions  as  toll  ticketing, 
network  interfacing,  common  channel    signalling,  and 
others.  
  Visitor location register (VLR):The VLR is a database 
that contains temporary information about subscribers that 
is  needed  by  the  MSC  in  order  to  service  visiting 
subscribers. The VLR is always integrated with the MSC.

between outside world and system, there is need of DTMF 
decoder  for  converting  frequencies  into  voltage  levels  of 
zeros  and  ones.  Microcontroller  used  in  is  a  8-bit  which 
serves  a  less  than  other  16-bit,  32-bit  microcontrollers. 
The  proposed  system  in  this  paper  is  designed  to  give 
complete  security  to  car.  The  system  consists  of  ARM  7 
microcontroller which is LPC 2148. The block diagram is 
as  shown  in  fig.1.  This  combines  microcontroller  with 
high speed flash memory ranging from 32 KB to 512 KB.

When  a  mobile  station  roams  into  a  new  MSC  area,  the 
VLR  connected  to  that  MSC  will  request  data  about  the 
mobile  station  from  the  HLR.  Later,  if  the  mobile  station 
makes  a  call,  the  VLR  will  have  the  information  needed 
for call setup  without having to interrogate the HLR each 
time.  
  Authentication  centre  (AUC):  A  unit  called  the  AUC 
provides  authentication  and  encryption  parameters  that 
verify  the  user's  identity  and  ensure  the  confidentiality  of 
each  call.  The  AUC  protects  network  operators  from 
different  types  of  fraud  found  in  today's  cellular  world. 
  Equipment  identity  register  (EIR):  The  EIR  is  a 
database  that  contains  information  about  the  identity  of 
mobile  equipment 
that  prevents  calls  from  stolen, 
unauthorized, or defective mobile stations. 
  The  first  commercial  RFID  application  was  the 
Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS). It was developed in 
the seventies as a theft prevention system. It was based on 
tags that can store a single bit. That bit was read when the 
customer left the store and the system would sound alarm 
when the bit was not unset. In the end-seventies RFID tags 
made  its  way  into  the  agriculture  for  example  for  animal 
tagging. 
A RFID reader and a few tags are in general of little use. 
  The retrieval of a serial number does not provide much 
information  to  the  user  nor  does  it  help  to  keep  track  of 
items in a production chain. The real power of 
  RFID comes in combination with a backend that stores 
additional  information  such  as  descriptions  for  products 
and  where  and  when  a  certain  tag  was  scanned.  The 
expected  proliferation  of  RFID  tags  into  the  billions  has 
raised  many  privacy  and  security  concerns.  A  common 
concern is the loss of privacy when companies scan tags to 
acquire  information  about  customers  and  then  using  data 
mining  techniques  to  create  individual  profiles.  This 
section describes possible  scenarios  where RFID tags can 
be  exploited

G. Camera: It is possible to fit camera in a car very easily. 
This  can  be  set  to  broadcast  images  to  owner  via  the 
internet so at any time the car owner can see what is going 
on inside the car.  
  H.  Relay:  The  relay  we  are  using 
is 
electromechanical  relay.  The  voltage  required  is  +12V 
DC.  It  can  be  obtained  using  the  relay  driver  IC.    When 
the relay is excited by applying the 12V DC, the relay gets 
activated,  turns  ON  the  device  and  when  the  excited 
voltage  is  stopped,  the  relay  gets  deactivated  and      turns 
OFF the device.  
 
I.  Thumb   Impression: This machine is available at a 
very low price. We can connect this machine directly with 
the computer system to transfer the data.  USB device like 
pen drive can be used for data transfer. It takes less than 2 
seconds  to  identify  the  thumb  impression.  It’s    Size  is  21 
X 3.5 X 14.5 cm. Module used is x990. 
 
J.  Steering  Wheel  Lock:  Another  most  important 
security provided against theft is steering wheel lock. ‘The 
club’  is  the  most  popular  steering  wheel  lock  and  is  least 
expensive.  This  lock  goes  over  the  steering  wheel  so  no 
one can drive it until he/she removes the lock.  
 
II)   Software specifications  
 
Keil  was  founded  in  1986  to  market  add-on  products  for 
the  development  tools.  It  is  provided  by  many  of  the 
silicon  vendors.  The  Keil  generates  code  for  any  device 
that  is  compatible  with  the  8051,  251,  C16x/ST10,  or 
ARM microcontrollers. The   exception to this would be a 
device  that  has  removed  or  changed  the  instruction  set. 
However,  that  device  would  no  longer  be  a  compatible 
part. When we start a project using the Keil uVision IDE, 
we must select a chip from database.  
 
4.  Conclusion 
 
Because  of  this  security  system,  it  is  too  hard  to  an 
unknown  person  to  steal  the  car.  This  is  a  low-cost  and 
excellent  vehicle  anti-theft  control  system.  Some  extra 
features like face recognition, alcohol sensor, tire lock can 
be  added  to  give  more  security.  Future  scope  is  that  the 
system should be embedded on single chip.
