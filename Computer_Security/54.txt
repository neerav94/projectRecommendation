2.2 Types of RFID Systems  
 
One  broad  classification  of  RFID  tags  is 
whether they contain a microchip or not. “Chip” tags 
contain an integrated circuit chip, whereas “chipless” 
tags  are less expensive to make and may store  up to 
24  bits  of 
information-which  provides  enough 
memory  for  a  company’s  internal  use,  such  as  on  a 
ship floor or within a warehouse.

In  order 

identify  all 
manufactured  items,  an  RFID  tag  must  have  enough 
memory  storage  to  hold  ID  number  designed  to 
identify a massive number of objects. And the reader 
must be able to read multiple tags within its range and 
in  close  proximity.  Chip  tag  RFID  systems  enable 
data,  such  as  a  serial  number  or  product  code,  to  be 
stored and transmitted by portable tags to readers that 
process the data according to the needs of a particular 
application.  Currently small chips are available which 
are able to store 96-bits of data – enough to include  a 
manufacturer’s  name,  a  product  name  and  one  of 
trillions  of  unique  numbers  that  can  be  assigned  to 
products.  

 
There  are  three  types  of  tags:  "read  only", 
"write once read many(WORM)" and "read/write"[3]. 
They are "read only" if the identification is encoded at 
the 
time  of  manufacturing  and  not  rewritable. 
"WORM"  tags  are  programmable  ones  at  the  user 
end., but without the ability to rewrite them later while 
the  "Read/write  tags,"  have  the  ability  to  modify 
information . 
 

The  working  of  RFID  systems  and  their 
features  depend  on  the  type  of  tag  the  system  uses. 
There  are  two  main  types  of  RFID  tags,  namely, 
active or passive, which differ depending on whether 
they have their own power system. 
 

Active RFID tags have both an on-tag power 
source  and  an  active  transmitter,  offer  superior 
performance. Because they are connected to their own 
battery, they can be read at a much higher range-from 
several kilometers away. But they are larger and more 
expensive  and  hence  are  suitable  for  manufacturing, 
such as tracking components on an assembly line, or 
for logistics – primarily where the tag device will be 
reused.  
 
 
Passive tags have no power source and no on-
tag transmitter, which gives them a range of less than 
10 meters and make them sensitive to regulatory and 
environmental  constraints.  However,  they  have  the

drastically. 

3.2 Components required for the proposed RFID 
system : 
 The  system has four components:  

1)  RFID tags that are electronically programmed 
with unique information. 2) Readers to query 
the  tags  3)  Antenna  4)  Server  to  load  the 
software  that  interfaces  with  the  integrated 
library software. 

3.3 Working of the proposed RFID system : 
                                                             

Tags: The RFID tag can be fixed inside a book's back 
cover  or  directly  onto  CDs  and  videos.  This  tag  is 
equipped  with  a  programmable  chip  and  an  antenna. 
Each paper-thin tag contains an engraved antenna and 
a  microchip  with  a  capacity  of  at  least  64  bits. 
"Read/write tags," are used in this system .  

 

Readers:    When  a  tag  passes  through  the  field,  the 
information stored on the chip in the tag is interpreted 
by  the  reader  and  sent  to  the  server,  which,  in  turn, 
communicates  with  the  integrated  library  system. 
RFID  gate  sensors  (readers)  at  exits  reads  the 
information on the tag(s) going by and communicates 
that information to a server. The server, after checking 
the  circulation  database,  turns  on  an  alarm  if  the 
material  is  not  properly  checked  out.  Readers  in  
library are used at the following places in the library:  

•  Processing station: where object data ( userid, 
volume  no.    etc  of  the  books  /  magazines 
/CD’s etc) is written to the tag . 

•  Circulation  station  :  used  for  the  issue  and 

return of  books / CDs etc.  

•  Check-in station: used for checking the books 

/cDs etc.  

•  Exit sensors: Used for verification of 

books/cds leaving the library. 

the  various  components.  It  receives 

 
Server:  The  server  is  the  communication  gateway 
among 
the 
information  from  one  or  more  of  the  readers  and 
exchanges  information  with  the  circulation  database. 
Its software includes the SIP/SIP2 (Session Initiation 
Protocol), APIs (Applications Programming Interface) 
NCIP  (National  Circulation  Interchange  Protocol)  or 
SLNP  necessary  to  interface  it  with  the  integrated 
library  software  but  no  library  vendor  has  yet  fully 
implemented  NCIP  approved  by  NISO  (Koppel, 
2004).  The  server  typically  includes  a  transaction 
database so that reports can be produced.

Unauthorized  readers  may  compromise  privacy  by 
accessing tags without adequate access control. Even 
if  tags  contents  are  protected,  individuals  may  be 
tracked through predictable tag responses, essentially 
a  traffic  analysis  attack  violating  location  privacy. 
Another  important  privacy  concern  is  tracking  of 
individuals  by  RFID  tags.  A  tag  reader  at  a  fixed 
location  could  track  RFID  labeled  books  carried  by 
people passing by. To address the security risks of low 
cost  RFID  tags,  passive  tags  will  be  used  which 
provide    simple  identification  functionality.  Our  tags 
contain  a  few  thousand  bits  of  storage  and  have  an 
operating  range  of  a  few  meters.  Tag  readers  are 
assumed  to  have  a  secure  connection  to  a  backend 
database,  although  readers  may  only  read  tags  from 
within  the  short  tag  operating  range.  A  misplaced

are the channels between the tag and the reader, which

by an antenna can be constantly present when multiple

2. ABOUT RFID TECHNOLOGY 

 

 
2.1 System Components 
 
An RFID system has three basic components, namely,  
1.  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  tags  or  transponders  that 
transmit the data to a reader . 
2.  RF readers or transceivers, devices which include 
an antenna to read and/or write data to RFID tags.   
3.  Communication system, a defined radio frequency 
and a   protocol to transmit and receive data from tags.

their 
contents by broadcasting an RF signal. Tags respond 
by transmitting back resident data, typically including 
a unique serial number.  RFID tags have several major 
advantages  over  optical  barcode  systems.  Tag  data 
may  be  read  automatically,  without  line  of  sight, 
through  non  conducting  materials  such  as  paper  or 
cardboard, at a rate of several hundred tags per second 
and  from  a  range  of  several  meters[1].  Since  tags 
typically are   silicon based microchips, functionality 

 
beyond simple identification may be incorporated into 
the    design.  This  functionality  might  range  from 
integrated  sensors,  to  read/write  storage,  to  support

2.2 Types of RFID Systems  
 
One  broad  classification  of  RFID  tags  is 
whether they contain a microchip or not. “Chip” tags 
contain an integrated circuit chip, whereas “chipless” 
tags  are less expensive to make and may store  up to 
24  bits  of 
information-which  provides  enough 
memory  for  a  company’s  internal  use,  such  as  on  a 
ship floor or within a warehouse.

In  order

manufactured  items,  an  RFID  tag  must  have  enough 
memory  storage  to  hold  ID  number  designed  to 
identify a massive number of objects. And the reader 
must be able to read multiple tags within its range and 
in  close  proximity.  Chip  tag  RFID  systems  enable 
data,  such  as  a  serial  number  or  product  code,  to  be 
stored and transmitted by portable tags to readers that 
process the data according to the needs of a particular 
application.  Currently small chips are available which 
are able to store 96-bits of data – enough to include  a 
manufacturer’s  name,  a  product  name  and  one  of 
trillions  of  unique  numbers  that  can  be  assigned  to 
products.  

 
There  are  three  types  of  tags:  "read  only", 
"write once read many(WORM)" and "read/write"[3]. 
They are "read only" if the identification is encoded at 
the 
time  of  manufacturing  and  not  rewritable. 
"WORM"  tags  are  programmable  ones  at  the  user 
end., but without the ability to rewrite them later while 
the  "Read/write  tags,"  have  the  ability  to  modify 
information . 
 

The  working  of  RFID  systems  and  their 
features  depend  on  the  type  of  tag  the  system  uses. 
There  are  two  main  types  of  RFID  tags,  namely, 
active or passive, which differ depending on whether 
they have their own power system. 
 

Active RFID tags have both an on-tag power 
source  and  an  active  transmitter,  offer  superior 
performance. Because they are connected to their own 
battery, they can be read at a much higher range-from 
several kilometers away. But they are larger and more 
expensive  and  hence  are  suitable  for  manufacturing, 
such as tracking components on an assembly line, or 
for logistics – primarily where the tag device will be 
reused.  
 
 
Passive tags have no power source and no on-
tag transmitter, which gives them a range of less than 
10 meters and make them sensitive to regulatory and 
environmental  constraints.  However,  they  have  the

RFID tags are interrogated by readers, which 
in turn are connected to a host computer. In a passive 
system the RFID reader transmits an energy field that 
“wakes up” the tag and powers its chip, enabling it to 
transmit  or  store  data.  Active  tags  may  periodically

In  this  paper  a  secure  methodology  for 
library management system using low cost RFID 
tags  is  proposed.  RFID  can  be  used  for  library 
circulation operations and theft detection systems. 
RFID-based  systems  move  beyond  security  to 
become  tracking  systems  that  combine  security 
with  more  efficient 
tracking  of  materials 
throughout the library, including easier and faster 
charge and discharge. The information contained

Privacy  concerns  associated  with  item-level 
tagging is another significant barrier to library use of 
RFID  tags.  The  problem  with  today's  library  RFID 
system is that the tags contain static information that 
can  be  relatively  easily  read  by  unauthorized  tag 
readers.    Our  paper  emphasises  on  this  privacy 
concerns and proposes an alternative methodology to 
overcome  the  limitations    of  static  information.  The 
tag usage for the library books is shown in figure 2[7]. 
In the proposed method the information in the tag  is 
dynamic.

drastically. 

3.2 Components required for the proposed RFID 
system : 
 The  system has four components:  

1)  RFID tags that are electronically programmed 
with unique information. 2) Readers to query 
the  tags  3)  Antenna  4)  Server  to  load  the 
software  that  interfaces  with  the  integrated 
library software. 

3.3 Working of the proposed RFID system : 
                                                             

Tags: The RFID tag can be fixed inside a book's back 
cover  or  directly  onto  CDs  and  videos.  This  tag  is 
equipped  with  a  programmable  chip  and  an  antenna. 
Each paper-thin tag contains an engraved antenna and 
a  microchip  with  a  capacity  of  at  least  64  bits. 
"Read/write tags," are used in this system .  

 

Readers:    When  a  tag  passes  through  the  field,  the 
information stored on the chip in the tag is interpreted 
by  the  reader  and  sent  to  the  server,  which,  in  turn, 
communicates  with  the  integrated  library  system. 
RFID  gate  sensors  (readers)  at  exits  reads  the 
information on the tag(s) going by and communicates 
that information to a server. The server, after checking 
the  circulation  database,  turns  on  an  alarm  if  the 
material  is  not  properly  checked  out.  Readers  in  
library are used at the following places in the library:  

•  Processing station: where object data ( userid, 
volume  no.    etc  of  the  books  /  magazines 
/CD’s etc) is written to the tag . 

•  Circulation  station  :  used  for  the  issue  and 

return of  books / CDs etc.  

•  Check-in station: used for checking the books 

/cDs etc.  

•  Exit sensors: Used for verification of 

books/cds leaving the library. 

the  various  components.  It  receives 

 
Server:  The  server  is  the  communication  gateway 
among 
the 
information  from  one  or  more  of  the  readers  and 
exchanges  information  with  the  circulation  database. 
Its software includes the SIP/SIP2 (Session Initiation 
Protocol), APIs (Applications Programming Interface) 
NCIP  (National  Circulation  Interchange  Protocol)  or 
SLNP  necessary  to  interface  it  with  the  integrated 
library  software  but  no  library  vendor  has  yet  fully 
implemented  NCIP  approved  by  NISO  (Koppel, 
2004).  The  server  typically  includes  a  transaction 
database so that reports can be produced.

Unauthorized  readers  may  compromise  privacy  by 
accessing tags without adequate access control. Even 
if  tags  contents  are  protected,  individuals  may  be 
tracked through predictable tag responses, essentially 
a  traffic  analysis  attack  violating  location  privacy. 
Another  important  privacy  concern  is  tracking  of 
individuals  by  RFID  tags.  A  tag  reader  at  a  fixed 
location  could  track  RFID  labeled  books  carried  by 
people passing by. To address the security risks of low 
cost  RFID  tags,  passive  tags  will  be  used  which 
provide    simple  identification  functionality.  Our  tags 
contain  a  few  thousand  bits  of  storage  and  have  an 
operating  range  of  a  few  meters.  Tag  readers  are 
assumed  to  have  a  secure  connection  to  a  backend 
database,  although  readers  may  only  read  tags  from 
within  the  short  tag  operating  range.  A  misplaced

Assuming the tag can store up to a maximum 
of  256  characters,  we  divide  the  available  storage  of 
the tag into three parts. The first 8 characters are for 
identification  of  library    material  and  the  remaining 
248 characters are for the  material identification.

indicates  the    Material  Identification  which    is  a 
unique code consisting of materialid and userid . 
In  this  system,  the  material  identification 
 
consists  of  two  unique  id’s.  One  id  specifies  the 
material  and  the  other  specifies  user  id  which  is 
dynamic.  The  total  length  of  materialid  is  248  bytes 
among  which  216  bytes  are  for  materialid  and  the 
remaining 32 bytes are reserved for userid .

3.5 How it works?   
            

 After reading  the information from the tag, it 
is  sent  to  the  conversion  unit  where  the  code  is 
divided into materialid and userid as specified above. 
Conversion  unit  is  a  software  which  is  capable  of 
reading data from the tag through the reader and write 
the  data  into  the  tag  from  the  database  OPAC.  The 
userid, which is encrypted form, is read from the tag. 
Once  the  conversion  unit  decrypts  the  code  the 
information regarding the user and the material will be 
invoked form OPAC.  Depending on   the transactions 
made by the user, the information in the tag will be 
modified. 
 
Three cases arise, which are dealt as follows: 

1.  If the material is to be returned to the library 
information  regarding  the  userid  part  will  be 
made 0’s. 

2.  If  the  material  is  to  be  retained  by  the  old 
user,  then  no  change  is  to  be  made  in  the 
userid part. 

3.  If  the  material  is  to  be  issued  to  a  new  user 

then the userid should be updated.

Algorithm : 
 
Step1 : The information in the tag contains  Materialid      

and  Userid.  Userid    which  is  dynamic  is  in  the

Step2 :  Reader reads the information from the tag. 
 
Step 3: Here the user id will be decrypted by using a 
relevant  decryption algorithm. 
 
Step  4:  The  database  checks  whether  the  user  is 
authorized  or  not  with  the  help  of  the  decrypted 
userid.  If  a  match  occurs    with  the  existing  user  id 
then it retrieves  the corresponding information . 
 
Step 5 :  The corresponding transaction( issue / return/ 
renewal ) will be made. 
 
Step6 : After the transaction is completed the user id 
is encrypted and is read into the tag. 
 
3.6  Limitations of RFID systems 
 
High  cost.  The  major  disadvantage  of  RFID 
technology is its cost.  
 
Reader  collision.  The  signal  from  one  reader  can 
interfere with the signal from another where coverage 
overlaps.  This  is  called  reader  collision.  One  way  to 
avoid  the  problem  is  to  use  a  technique  called  time 
division multiple access, or TDMA. In simple terms, 
the  readers  are  instructed  to  read  at  different  times, 
rather than both trying to read at the same time. This 
ensures that they don't interfere with each other. But it 
means  any  RFID  tag  in  an  area  where  two  readers 
overlap will be read twice . 
 
Tag  collision.  Another  problem  readers  have  is 
reading a lot of chips in the same field. Tag clash 
occurs  when  more  than  one  chip  reflects  back  a 
signal  at  the  same  time,  confusing  the  reader. 
Different  vendors  have  developed  different  systems 
for having the tags respond to the reader one at a time. 
Since they can be read in milliseconds, it appears that 
all the tags are being read simultaneously.

RFID tags are interrogated by readers, which 
in turn are connected to a host computer. In a passive 
system the RFID reader transmits an energy field that 
“wakes up” the tag and powers its chip, enabling it to 
transmit  or  store  data.  Active  tags  may  periodically

In  this  paper  a  secure  methodology  for 
library management system using low cost RFID 
tags  is  proposed.  RFID  can  be  used  for  library 
circulation operations and theft detection systems. 
RFID-based  systems  move  beyond  security  to 
become  tracking  systems  that  combine  security 
with  more  efficient 
tracking  of  materials 
throughout the library, including easier and faster 
charge and discharge. The information contained

Privacy  concerns  associated  with  item-level 
tagging is another significant barrier to library use of 
RFID  tags.  The  problem  with  today's  library  RFID 
system is that the tags contain static information that 
can  be  relatively  easily  read  by  unauthorized  tag 
readers.    Our  paper  emphasises  on  this  privacy 
concerns and proposes an alternative methodology to 
overcome  the  limitations    of  static  information.  The 
tag usage for the library books is shown in figure 2[7]. 
In the proposed method the information in the tag  is 
dynamic.

drastically. 

3.2 Components required for the proposed RFID 
system : 
 The  system has four components:  

1)  RFID tags that are electronically programmed 
with unique information. 2) Readers to query 
the  tags  3)  Antenna  4)  Server  to  load  the 
software  that  interfaces  with  the  integrated 
library software. 

3.3 Working of the proposed RFID system : 
                                                             

Tags: The RFID tag can be fixed inside a book's back 
cover  or  directly  onto  CDs  and  videos.  This  tag  is 
equipped  with  a  programmable  chip  and  an  antenna. 
Each paper-thin tag contains an engraved antenna and 
a  microchip  with  a  capacity  of  at  least  64  bits. 
"Read/write tags," are used in this system .  

 

Readers:    When  a  tag  passes  through  the  field,  the 
information stored on the chip in the tag is interpreted 
by  the  reader  and  sent  to  the  server,  which,  in  turn, 
communicates  with  the  integrated  library  system. 
RFID  gate  sensors  (readers)  at  exits  reads  the 
information on the tag(s) going by and communicates 
that information to a server. The server, after checking 
the  circulation  database,  turns  on  an  alarm  if  the 
material  is  not  properly  checked  out.  Readers  in  
library are used at the following places in the library:  

•  Processing station: where object data ( userid, 
volume  no.    etc  of  the  books  /  magazines 
/CD’s etc) is written to the tag . 

•  Circulation  station  :  used  for  the  issue  and 

return of  books / CDs etc.  

•  Check-in station: used for checking the books 

/cDs etc.  

•  Exit sensors: Used for verification of 

books/cds leaving the library. 

the  various  components.  It  receives 

 
Server:  The  server  is  the  communication  gateway 
among 
the 
information  from  one  or  more  of  the  readers  and 
exchanges  information  with  the  circulation  database. 
Its software includes the SIP/SIP2 (Session Initiation 
Protocol), APIs (Applications Programming Interface) 
NCIP  (National  Circulation  Interchange  Protocol)  or 
SLNP  necessary  to  interface  it  with  the  integrated 
library  software  but  no  library  vendor  has  yet  fully 
implemented  NCIP  approved  by  NISO  (Koppel, 
2004).  The  server  typically  includes  a  transaction 
database so that reports can be produced.

Unauthorized  readers  may  compromise  privacy  by 
accessing tags without adequate access control. Even 
if  tags  contents  are  protected,  individuals  may  be 
tracked through predictable tag responses, essentially 
a  traffic  analysis  attack  violating  location  privacy. 
Another  important  privacy  concern  is  tracking  of 
individuals  by  RFID  tags.  A  tag  reader  at  a  fixed 
location  could  track  RFID  labeled  books  carried  by 
people passing by. To address the security risks of low 
cost  RFID  tags,  passive  tags  will  be  used  which 
provide    simple  identification  functionality.  Our  tags 
contain  a  few  thousand  bits  of  storage  and  have  an 
operating  range  of  a  few  meters.  Tag  readers  are 
assumed  to  have  a  secure  connection  to  a  backend 
database,  although  readers  may  only  read  tags  from 
within  the  short  tag  operating  range.  A  misplaced 
book or a tag  sends a special alert to the reader, with

by an antenna can be constantly present when multiple 
tags  are  expected  continually.  Antennas  can  be  built

Assuming the tag can store up to a maximum 
of  256  characters,  we  divide  the  available  storage  of 
the tag into three parts. The first 8 characters are for 
identification  of  library    material  and  the  remaining 
248 characters are for the  material identification.

             MC    denotes  the  material  Code    while  Mid 
indicates  the    Material  Identification  which    is  a 
unique code consisting of materialid and userid . 
In  this  system,  the  material  identification 
 
consists  of  two  unique  id’s.  One  id  specifies  the 
material  and  the  other  specifies  user  id  which  is 
dynamic.  The  total  length  of  materialid  is  248  bytes 
among  which  216  bytes  are  for  materialid  and  the 
remaining 32 bytes are reserved for userid .

3.5 How it works?   
            

 After reading  the information from the tag, it 
is  sent  to  the  conversion  unit  where  the  code  is 
divided into materialid and userid as specified above. 
Conversion  unit  is  a  software  which  is  capable  of 
reading data from the tag through the reader and write 
the  data  into  the  tag  from  the  database  OPAC.  The 
userid, which is encrypted form, is read from the tag. 
Once  the  conversion  unit  decrypts  the  code  the 
information regarding the user and the material will be 
invoked form OPAC.  Depending on   the transactions 
made by the user, the information in the tag will be 
modified. 
 
Three cases arise, which are dealt as follows: 

1.  If the material is to be returned to the library 
information  regarding  the  userid  part  will  be 
made 0’s. 

2.  If  the  material  is  to  be  retained  by  the  old 
user,  then  no  change  is  to  be  made  in  the 
userid part. 

3.  If  the  material  is  to  be  issued  to  a  new  user 

then the userid should be updated.

Algorithm : 
 
Step1 : The information in the tag contains  Materialid      

and  Userid.  Userid    which  is  dynamic  is  in  the 
encrypted form. 

  
Step2 :  Reader reads the information from the tag. 
 
Step 3: Here the user id will be decrypted by using a 
relevant  decryption algorithm. 
 
Step  4:  The  database  checks  whether  the  user  is 
authorized  or  not  with  the  help  of  the  decrypted 
userid.  If  a  match  occurs    with  the  existing  user  id 
then it retrieves  the corresponding information . 
 
Step 5 :  The corresponding transaction( issue / return/ 
renewal ) will be made. 
 
Step6 : After the transaction is completed the user id 
is encrypted and is read into the tag. 
 
3.6  Limitations of RFID systems 
 
High  cost.  The  major  disadvantage  of  RFID 
technology is its cost.  
 
Reader  collision.  The  signal  from  one  reader  can 
interfere with the signal from another where coverage 
overlaps.  This  is  called  reader  collision.  One  way  to 
avoid  the  problem  is  to  use  a  technique  called  time 
division multiple access, or TDMA. In simple terms, 
the  readers  are  instructed  to  read  at  different  times, 
rather than both trying to read at the same time. This 
ensures that they don't interfere with each other. But it 
means  any  RFID  tag  in  an  area  where  two  readers 
overlap will be read twice . 
 
Tag  collision.  Another  problem  readers  have  is 
reading a lot of chips in the same field. Tag clash 
occurs  when  more  than  one  chip  reflects  back  a 
signal  at  the  same  time,  confusing  the  reader. 
Different  vendors  have  developed  different  systems 
for having the tags respond to the reader one at a time. 
Since they can be read in milliseconds, it appears that 
all the tags are being read simultaneously.

Lack  of  Standard.  The  tags  used  by  library  RFID 
vendors  are not  compatible  even  when  they  conform 
to  the  same  standards  because  the  current  standards 
only  seek  electronic  compatibility  between  tags  and 
readers. The pattern of encoding information and the 
software  that  processes  the  information  differs  from 
vendor  to  vendor,  therefore,  a  change  from  one 
vendor's system to the other would require retagging 
all items or modifying the software [4]. 
  
3.7 Best Practices for Libraries  

 
As libraries are implementing RFID systems, 
it is important to develop best practices guidelines to 
utilize  the  technology  in  best  way  and  to  keep  the 
privacy concern away. The following may be the best 
practices guidelines for library RFID use :  

technology 

•  The  Library  should  be  open  about  its  use  of 
providing 
RFID 
publicly  available  documents  stating 
the 
rational for using RFID, objectives of its use 
and  associated  policies  and  procedure  and 
who to contact with questions.  

including 

•  Signs  should  be  pasted  at  all  facilities  using 
RFID. The signs should inform the public that 
RFID technology is in use, the types of usage 
and  a  statement  of  protection  of  privacy  and 
how 
technology  differs  from  other 
information collection methods.  

•  Only authorized personnel should have access 

this 

to the RFID system.  

•  No personal  information should be stored on 

the RFID tag.  
Information describing the tagged item should 
be  encrypted  on  the  tag  even  if  the  data  is 
limited to a serial number. 

•  No static information should be contained on 
the tag (bar code, manufacturer number) that 
can be read by unauthorised readers . 

•  All  communication  between  tag  and  reader 
should  be  encrypted  via  a  unique  encryption 
key.  

•  All  RFID  readers  in  the  library  should  be 

clearly marked.  
ISO 18000 mode-2 tags should be used rather 
than ISO 15693.  

•

(RFID) 
Systems  have  been  in  use  in  libraries  for  book 
identification,  for  self  checkout,  for  anti-theft 
control, for inventory control, and for the sorting 
and  conveying  of  library  books  and  audio  visual 
materials.  These  applications  can 
to 
significant  savings 
labor  costs,  enhance 
customer service, lower book theft and provide a 
constant  record  update  of  media  collections.  In 
this  paper,  the  technical  features  of  a  modern 
RFID system are described to provide a guideline 
for the evaluation of different systems. The most 
important  result  is  that  non-proprietary  systems 
can  be  used  for  libraries  today  since  the  new 
generation  of  RFID  chips  with  the  ISO  standard 
15693  are  available.  With 
technology, 
libraries  are  not  dependent  on  one  company  for 
their lifeline.
