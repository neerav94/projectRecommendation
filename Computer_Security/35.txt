Abstract 

Home  security  and  monitoring  are  two  significant  parameters  to  safeguard  the  household  components. 
An  eye  is  to  be  focused  specifically  to  perform  the  above  two  parameters.  An  electronic  eye  may 
substantially improve the safety mechanism of the living house. Security threatening in the absence of the 
house owners is increasing day-by-day. This study considered sensor assembly to detect the unauthorized 
entry  using  IR  sensors,  glass  breakage  detection  sensor,  locker  security  switch,  panic  switch  and  LDR 
sensors.  A  microcontroller  (ARM  7)  is  used  to  process  the  acquired  signals  from  various  sensor  levels. 
Accordingly an SMS will be send to the house owner using Global system for mobile communication (GSM). 
Max 232 line drivers were used to translate the data serially from ARM7 to GSM. The proposed methodology 
produced significantly favorable results.  
Keywords: Electronic eye, security threatening, microcontroller, IR sensors, GSM.   

Introduction 
Security is  alarming  every individual  to  safe  guard their 
belongings  and  properties.  The 
theft  chances  are 
increasing with the advancement of technology. Security 
persons are also unable to curtail the theft chances due 
to  tiredness  and  human  mistakes.  Theft  attempt  may 
enable  the  nearby  security  person  by  triggering  the 
buzzer  automatically  and  also  sending  the  message 
quickly to the concerned persons to make them alert with 
the  support  of  GSM  technology.  The  automation  of  the 
security monitoring system using electronics assembly is 
enabling  to  develop  a  mechanism  to  curtail  the  theft 
chances  at  any  desired  points.  Bangali  and  Shaligram 
(2013)  proposed  a  traditional  home  security  system 
which gives the signals in terms of alarm. However, the 
GSM  based  security  systems  provides  enhanced 
security as whenever a signal from sensor occurs, a text 
message  is  sent  to  a  predefined  number  to  take 
necessary  actions.  Nandeesh  et  al.  (2014)  projected  a 
mechanism that secures people from leaking of raw gas 
and fire at home and industries. This system used GPS 
and  GSM  Technology.  GPS  finds  location  and  sends 
location  information  where  the  fire  occurs  to  nearest  
fire  station  and  police  station  and  also  opens  
emergency  windows.  Agarwal  and  Nayak 
(2012) 
proposed  construction  of  home  security  system  which 
has a password protected door lock with an LED based 
resistive  screen  input  panel  and  also  focused  to  detect 
any obstacle while monitoring the windows and doors at 
night or when away using IR sensors. Fire alarm system 
uses  temperature  sensor  LM35  which  senses  sudden 
considerable  increase  in  temperature  and  raises  alarm. 
Lee  et  al.  (2013)  described  a  multilevel  home  security 
system which consists of different sensor nodes, priority 
interrupt  controller  (PIC)  and  universal  asynchronous 

receiver  and  transmitter  (UART).  Keeping  the  above 
facts in view, this study also focused on Graphical User 
Interface  (GUI)  which  enables  the  function  of  capturing 
images  and  sending  emails.  The  captured  images  are 
delivered  to  the  house  owners  and  the  police  forces  to 
prevent the thieves’ invasion. 
 
Materials and methods 
Infrared sensor (IR): To detect the intruder, IR sensor is 
used at the entrance door and at the exit door (Fig. 1). 
The sensor is positioned to detect the intruder within ‘5’ ft 
distance.  The  thermal  radiation  emitted  by  the  object 
(Intruder) is  detected  by  the infrared  sensor.  An  emitter 
(IR light emitting diode) and a detector (IR photo diode) 
were used in this study. The change of resistance at the 
photo diode is recorded and its magnitude is proportional 
to the output voltage signal. This change is subjected to 
the  received  IR  signal  magnitude.  The  output  signal  at 
the IR detector is measured (5 V) when there is no light 
input. When light source input is seen on the IR detector, 
the  output  voltage  is  (3.5  V)  measured.  IR  sensor  is 
directly interfaced to the microcontroller. A 3.5 V at the IR 
sensor  output  causes  to  send  SMS  to  the  concerned 
authority using Global system for mobile communication 
(GSM).  
 
Glass  break  detection  sensor:  The  vibrations  while 
breaking  the  glass  is  to  be  detected  using  ceramic 
piezoelectric  buzzer  plate  used  as  a  glass  breaking 
sensor (Fig. 2). A thin metal plate is inbuilt with in piezo 
ceramic disc which senses the vibration and generates a 
sound  wave.  The  vibrations  induced  due  to  glass 
breakage  are  proportional 
the  voltage  signal. 
The  sensor  draws  an  output  signal  of  0.56  to  ‘0.58  V 
when glass is not break.

The  sensor  draws  an  output  signal  of  0.25 V to  0.30  V 
when the glass is broken. This sensor is interfaced to the 
microcontroller for further operations. A 0.25 V to 0.30 V 
at  the  sensor  output  causes  to  send  an  SMS  to  the 
concerned authority using GSM. 
 
Light  dependent  resister  (LDR):  An  LDR  is  used  as  a 
sensor  to  sense  the  intensity  of  light  in  the  particular 
room. The lights will be in the ‘OFF’ state during the day 
time  since  the  intensity  of  the  light  is  high.  The  lights 
need  to  be  ‘ON’  when  the  intensity  of  the  light  is  low. 
This  will  be  controlled  by  interfacing  the  LDR  to  the 
microcontroller  (Fig.  3).  The  microcontroller  will  trigger 
the relays to energize the light devices. When lights are 
switched  ‘ON’  an  SMS  will  be  sent  to  the  concerned 
authority using GSM. An amount of light falls on the LDR 
will influence the change of resistance. 
The resistance is estimated with RL = 500 Lux 
A 3.3K Ω resistance is used to connect the LDR to 5 V.  
V0 = 5 X RL/(RL+3.3) 
Light Intensity measured is 10 Lux 
RL = 500X10 = 5000 Ω  
V0 = 5 X 5000/(5000+3.3)  
V0= 10.39 V. 
The output voltage of the LDR is estimated as 10.39 V. 
If  the  voltage  output  is  greater  than  10.39  V,  then  the 
lights will be ‘ON’ and an alert message  will be send to 
the concerned person. 
  
Communication: GSM is used to communicate the state 
of the house/room with the concerned authority (Fig. 4). 
The  controller  output  is  given  to  the  GSM  with  the 
support  of  Line  drivers  (MAX  232)  and  Recommended 
standard (RS)-232 C serial communication device.

If  
The switch is ‘ON’ logic ‘1’is given to microcontroller 
Then  
Enable the buzzer 
Send an SMS “I am accessing your locker please send 
me your password “to 9848960527  
Else  
Repeat Step 3 
 
Results and discussion 
The  developed  working  model  is  tested  in  real  time 
applications.  This  mechanism is  applied  to  the  Head of 
the  Department  (HOD), Electronics  and  Communication 
Engineering  cabin  to  test  the  reliability  of  the  product. 
An  IR  sensor  detected  the  entry  of  the  person  and  the 
state of the sensor is communicated to the HOD mobile 
with  the  support  of  GSM.  Figure  6  represents  the 
message intimation to the concerned authority. Figure 7 
represents the glass break detection state of the sensor 
to the HOD (Authorized person) mobile. The state of the 
light  intensity  levels  in  the  specified  HOD  (Authorized 
person) room is also able to monitor with the developed 
model. Figure 8 depicts that status. If any unauthorized 
person  is  trying  to  open  the  personal  locker,  a  switch 
provided  to  the  locker  cause  to  send  the  request  for 
password to the HOD. Sending the password or alerting 
the  security  depends  upon  the  situation.  Figure  9 
represents 
received  and  password 
messages  for  enabling  the  locker  system.  The  results 
produced  are 
the  proposed 
methodology  to  be  implemented  for  automating  the 
security levels of the home and even banking systems. 
  
Conclusion 
Safe guarding the personal and public properties without 
supervision of the human being is aimed with innovative 
technology  this  mechanism.  The  study  produced  more 
favorable  findings  to  implement  this  kind  of  security 
support to home and banking systems. So that theft can 
be  curtailed  with  the  response  of  the  security  persons.  
In future, this system can be powered with wireless spy 
camera  system  to  transmit  the  status  of  the  security 
levels  to  the  authorized  persons.  Image  and  data 
processing is proposed to be implemented in near future.
