this designed  PCB  layout  is  to  be  drawn  on  the  plain
copper  coated  board.  There  boards  are  available  in 2

The 12V supplies are obtained by using monolithic
voltage  regulator  IC’s  and  7912.  These  IC’s  provide
stabilized  outputs  of  +12V  respectively  with  1  ampere
rating. Heat sinks are required for these IC’s.

CAD in PCB: First the PCB layout is designed by CAD.
The print out is taken from the computer (of large size) for
out  clearance.  This  layer  is  given  to  the  photography
section to get the layout in its actual size. From this we
can have the positive and negative images of the layout.
This photographic image is exposed in the following three
methods.

Transformer: A  transformer  is  a  static  (or  stationary)
piece of which electric power in one circuit is transformed
into electric  power  of  the  same  frequency  in  another
circuit. It can raise or lower the voltage in a circuit but
with a corresponding decrease or increase in current. It
works with the principle of mutual induction. 

Rectifier: The DC level obtained from a sinusoidal input
can be improved 100% using a process called full-wave
rectification. It used 4 diodes in a bridge configuration. 

From the basic bridge configuration we see that two
diodes are conducting while the other two diodes are in
“off” state during the period t = 0 to T/2 Accordingly for
the negative of the input the conducting diodes. Thus the
polarity across the load is the same.

Filter: The filter circuit used here is the capacitor filter
circuit  where  a  capacitor  is  connected  at  the  rectifier
output,  and  a  DC  is  obtained  across  it.  The  filtered
waveform  is  essentially  a  DC  voltage  with  negligible
ripples, which is ultimately fed to the load.
Regulator: The output voltage from the capacitor is more
filtered and finally regulated. The voltage regulator is a
device,  which  maintains  the  output  voltage  constant
irrespective  of  the  change  in  supply  variations,  load
variation and temperature changes. Here we use two fixed
voltage regulators namely LM 7812, LM 7805 and LM
7912. The IC 7812 is a +12V regulator IC 7912 is a –12V
regulator and IC 7805 is a +5V regulator.

The exposed mesh is placed on plain copper coated
board  in  correct  alignment  by  using  wooden  clamps.
Special  paints  are  used  to  spread  over  the   mesh.
Paint flow  through  the  board  and  the  layout  lines  are
made on the copper board. Finally, there are fine layouts
on the copper board [5].

Etching:  This  can  be  done  both  by  manual  and
mechanical ways by immersing the board in to a solution
of  formic  chloride  and  hydrochloric  acid  and  finally
cleaning the board with soap. 

Regulated Power Supply: The power supply circuit that
uses   single    transformers    that    produces  12-0-12V.
Further, the outputs are full wave rectified. Both +12V and
-12V are taken from the two ends of the bridge. They are
unregulated  outputs  and  are  useful  for  non-critical
applications.  In  this  project  7812  positive  and  7912
negative  IC  regulators  are  used.  They  are  delivery
currents regulators.  But  they  are  input  voltage  can  be
made adjustable also.

Battery
Introduction:  In  isolated  systems  away  from  the  grid,
batteries are  used  for  storage  of  excess  solar  energy
converted into electrical energy. The only exceptions are
isolated  sunshine  load  such  as  irrigation  pumps  or
drinking water supplies for storage. In fact for small units
with  output  less  than  one  kilowatt.  Batteries seem to
be  the  only  technically  and    economically  available
storage    means.    Since  both    the    photo-voltaic  system
and batteries are  high   in  capital  costs. It is  necessary
that  the  overall  system  be  optimized  with  respect  to
available  energy  and  local  demand  pattern.  To  be
economically  attractive  the  storage  of  solar  electricity
requires  a  battery  with  a  particular  combination  of
properties:

Low cost
Long life
High reliability
High overall efficiency
Low discharge
Minimum maintenance
Ampere hour efficiency
Watt hour efficiency

We  use  lead  acid  battery  for  storing  the  electrical
energy from the solar panel for lighting the street and so
about the lead acid cells are explained below.

Lead-Acid Wet Cell: Where high values of load current
are  necessary,  the  lead-acid  cell  is  the  type  most
commonly  used.  The  electrolyte  is  a  dilute  solution  of
sulfuric    acid  (H SO ).  In    the    application    of  battery
power to  start  the engine in an auto mobile, for example,
the  load current to the starter motor is  typically 200 to
400A. One cell has a nominal output of 2.1V, but lead-acid
cells are often used in  a  series combination of three for
a 6-V   battery   and  six  for a 12-V battery. The  lead  acid
cell type  is  a secondary  cell  or storage cell, which can
be  recharged.  The  charge  and  discharge  cycle  can  be
repeated  many  times   to  restore   the   output  voltage,
as  long  as  the    cell  is  in  good  physical  condition.
However,  heat  with  excessive  charge  and  discharge
currents  shortends  the useful life to about 3 to 5 years
for  an  automobile  battery.  Of  the  different  types  of
secondary cells, the lead-acid type has the highest output
voltage, which allows fewer cells for a specified battery
voltage.

Construction: Inside a  lead-acid  battery,  the  positive
and negative  electrodes  consist  of  a  group  of  plates
welded  to a  connecting  strap. The plates are  immersed
in   the   electrolyte,  consisting of  8   parts  of  water  to
3  parts  of  concentrated  sulfuric   acid.   Each  plate  is
a  grid or  framework,  made  of  a  lead-antimony alloy.
This  construction  enables  the  active  material,  which  is
lead oxide, to be pasted into the grid. In manufacture of
the  cell,  a  forming  charge  produces  the  positive  and
negative  electrodes.  In  the  forming  process,  the  active
material in the positive plate is changed to lead peroxide
(pbo2). The negative electrode is spongy lead (pb).

Data Memory  Organization:  The  data  memory  is
partitioned  into  two  areas.  The  first  is  the  Special
Function Registers  (SFR)  area,  while  the  second  is  the
General Purpose Registers (GPR) area. The SFRs control
the operation of the device. Portions of data memory are
banked. This is for both the SFR area and the GPR area.
The GPR area is banked to allow greater than 116 bytes of
general purpose RAM. 

The  banked  areas of the SFR are for the registers
that control  the  peripheral functions. Banking requires
the use of control bits for bank selection. These control
bits  are  located  in    the  STATUS  Register.  Figure  2-1
shows the data  memory map organization. Instructions
MOVWF  and    MOVF  can  move  values  from  the W
register to  any  location in the register  file (“F”)  and
vice-versa.

The entire  data  memory  can  be  accessed  either
directly  using  the absolute address of each register file
or  indirectly  through  the  File  Select  Register  (FSR)
(Section 2.4). Indirect addressing uses the present value
of the RP0 bit for access into the banked  areas of data
memory. Data memory is partitioned into two banks which
contain  the  general  purpose  registers  and  the  special
function registers. Bank 0 is selected by clearing the RP0
bit (STATUS<5>). Setting the RP0 bit selects Bank 1. Each
Bank  extends  up  to  7Fh  (128  bytes).  The  first  twelve
locations  of  each  Bank  are  reserved  for  the  Special
Function Registers. The remainders are General Purpose
Registers implemented as static RAM.

General Purpose Register File: Each General Purpose
Register  (GPR)  is  8  bits  wide  and  is  accessed  either
directly   or   indirectly   through   the   FSR   (Section 2.4).
The GPR addresses in bank 1 are mapped to addresses in
bank 0. As an example, addressing location 0Ch or 8Ch
will access the same GPR.

piece of which electric power in one circuit is transformed
into electric  power  of  the  same  frequency  in  another
circuit. It can raise or lower the voltage in a circuit but
with a corresponding decrease or increase in current. It
works with the principle of mutual induction. 

Rectifier: The DC level obtained from a sinusoidal input
can be improved 100% using a process called full-wave
rectification. It used 4 diodes in a bridge configuration. 

From the basic bridge configuration we see that two
diodes are conducting while the other two diodes are in
“off” state during the period t = 0 to T/2 Accordingly for
the negative of the input the conducting diodes. Thus the
polarity across the load is the same.

Filter: The filter circuit used here is the capacitor filter
circuit  where  a  capacitor  is  connected  at  the  rectifier
output,  and  a  DC  is  obtained  across  it.  The  filtered
waveform  is  essentially  a  DC  voltage  with  negligible
ripples, which is ultimately fed to the load.
Regulator: The output voltage from the capacitor is more
filtered and finally regulated. The voltage regulator is a
device,  which  maintains  the  output  voltage  constant
irrespective  of  the  change  in  supply  variations,  load
variation and temperature changes. Here we use two fixed
voltage regulators namely LM 7812, LM 7805 and LM
7912. The IC 7812 is a +12V regulator IC 7912 is a –12V
regulator and IC 7805 is a +5V regulator.

The exposed mesh is placed on plain copper coated
board  in  correct  alignment  by  using  wooden  clamps.
Special  paints  are  used  to  spread  over  the   mesh.
Paint flow  through  the  board  and  the  layout  lines  are
made on the copper board. Finally, there are fine layouts
on the copper board [5].

Etching:  This  can  be  done  both  by  manual  and
mechanical ways by immersing the board in to a solution
of  formic  chloride  and  hydrochloric  acid  and  finally
cleaning the board with soap. 

Regulated Power Supply: The power supply circuit that
uses   single    transformers    that    produces  12-0-12V.
Further, the outputs are full wave rectified. Both +12V and
-12V are taken from the two ends of the bridge. They are
unregulated  outputs  and  are  useful  for  non-critical
applications.  In  this  project  7812  positive  and  7912
negative  IC  regulators  are  used.  They  are  delivery
currents regulators.  But  they  are  input  voltage  can  be

Battery
Introduction:  In  isolated  systems  away  from  the  grid,
batteries are  used  for  storage  of  excess  solar  energy
converted into electrical energy. The only exceptions are
isolated  sunshine  load  such  as  irrigation  pumps  or
drinking water supplies for storage. In fact for small units
with  output  less  than  one  kilowatt.  Batteries seem to
be  the  only  technically  and    economically  available
storage    means.    Since  both    the    photo-voltaic  system
and batteries are  high   in  capital  costs. It is  necessary
that  the  overall  system  be  optimized  with  respect  to
available  energy  and  local  demand  pattern.  To  be
economically  attractive  the  storage  of  solar  electricity
requires  a  battery  with  a  particular  combination  of
properties:

Low cost
Long life
High reliability
High overall efficiency
Low discharge
Minimum maintenance
Ampere hour efficiency
Watt hour efficiency

We  use  lead  acid  battery  for  storing  the  electrical
energy from the solar panel for lighting the street and so
about the lead acid cells are explained below.

Lead-Acid Wet Cell: Where high values of load current
are  necessary,  the  lead-acid  cell  is  the  type  most
commonly  used.  The  electrolyte  is  a  dilute  solution  of
sulfuric    acid  (H SO ).  In    the    application    of  battery
power to  start  the engine in an auto mobile, for example,
the  load current to the starter motor is  typically 200 to
400A. One cell has a nominal output of 2.1V, but lead-acid
cells are often used in  a  series combination of three for
a 6-V   battery   and  six  for a 12-V battery. The  lead  acid
cell type  is  a secondary  cell  or storage cell, which can
be  recharged.  The  charge  and  discharge  cycle  can  be
repeated  many  times   to  restore   the   output  voltage,
as  long  as  the    cell  is  in  good  physical  condition.
However,  heat  with  excessive  charge  and  discharge
currents  shortends  the useful life to about 3 to 5 years
for  an  automobile  battery.  Of  the  different  types  of
secondary cells, the lead-acid type has the highest output
voltage, which allows fewer cells for a specified battery
voltage.

Construction: Inside a  lead-acid  battery,  the  positive
and negative  electrodes  consist  of  a  group  of  plates
welded  to a  connecting  strap. The plates are  immersed
in   the   electrolyte,  consisting of  8   parts  of  water  to
3  parts  of  concentrated  sulfuric   acid.   Each  plate  is
a  grid or  framework,  made  of  a  lead-antimony alloy.
This  construction  enables  the  active  material,  which  is
lead oxide, to be pasted into the grid. In manufacture of
the  cell,  a  forming  charge  produces  the  positive  and
negative  electrodes.  In  the  forming  process,  the  active
material in the positive plate is changed to lead peroxide
(pbo2). The negative electrode is spongy lead (pb).

Data Memory  Organization:  The  data  memory  is
partitioned  into  two  areas.  The  first  is  the  Special
Function Registers  (SFR)  area,  while  the  second  is  the
General Purpose Registers (GPR) area. The SFRs control
the operation of the device. Portions of data memory are
banked. This is for both the SFR area and the GPR area.
The GPR area is banked to allow greater than 116 bytes of
general purpose RAM. 

The  banked  areas of the SFR are for the registers
that control  the  peripheral functions. Banking requires
the use of control bits for bank selection. These control
bits  are  located  in    the  STATUS  Register.  Figure  2-1
shows the data  memory map organization. Instructions
MOVWF  and    MOVF  can  move  values  from  the W
register to  any  location in the register  file (“F”)  and
vice-versa.

The entire  data  memory  can  be  accessed  either
directly  using  the absolute address of each register file
or  indirectly  through  the  File  Select  Register  (FSR)
(Section 2.4). Indirect addressing uses the present value
of the RP0 bit for access into the banked  areas of data
memory. Data memory is partitioned into two banks which
contain  the  general  purpose  registers  and  the  special
function registers. Bank 0 is selected by clearing the RP0
bit (STATUS<5>). Setting the RP0 bit selects Bank 1. Each
Bank  extends  up  to  7Fh  (128  bytes).  The  first  twelve
locations  of  each  Bank  are  reserved  for  the  Special
Function Registers. The remainders are General Purpose
Registers implemented as static RAM.

General Purpose Register File: Each General Purpose
Register  (GPR)  is  8  bits  wide  and  is  accessed  either
directly   or   indirectly   through   the   FSR   (Section 2.4).
The GPR addresses in bank 1 are mapped to addresses in
bank 0. As an example, addressing location 0Ch or 8Ch
will access the same GPR.

PCL and Pclath: The program counter (PC) specifies the
address of  the  instruction to fetch for xecution. The PC
is 13 bits wide. The low byte is called the PCL register.
This register is readable and writable. The high  byte is
called  the  PCH  register.  This  register  contains  the
PC<12:8> bits  and  is  not  directly readable or writable.
All updates to the PCH register go through the PCLATH
register.

Stack: The stack allows a combination of up to 8 program
calls and interrupts to occur. he stack contains the return
address from this branch in program execution. Midrange
devices have an 8 level deep x 13-bit wide hardware stack.
The  stack  space  is  not  part  of  either  program  or  data
space  and the stack  pointer is not  readable or writable.
The  PC  is  PUSHed  onto  the  stack  when  a  CALL
instruction is executed or an interrupt causes a branch. 

The  stack  is  POPed  in  the  event  of  a  RETURN,
RETLW or a RETFIE instruction execution. PCLATH is
not modified when the stack  is  PUSHed  or  POPed. After
the  stack has been PUSHed eight times, the ninth push
overwrites the value that was stored from the first push.
The tenth push overwrites the second push (and so on).

Indirect  Addressing;  INDF  and  FSR  Registers:  The
INDF register is not a physical register. Addressing INDF
actually  addresses 
is
contained in the FSR register (FSR is a pointer). This is
indirect addressing.

Solenoid Valve (Or) Cut off Valve: The Solenoid control
valve is used to control the flow direction is called cut off
valve  or  solenoid  valve.  This  solenoid  cut  off  valve  is
controlled by  the microcontroller unit which is attached
in  the  pass  word  itself.  The  solenoid  valve  is  used  to
ON/OFF the fuel supply to the engine.

The directional valve is one of the important parts of
a fluid system. Commonly known as DCV, this valve is
used  to  control  the  direction  of  air  flow  in  the  fluid
system. The directional valve does this by changing the
position of its internal movable parts. 

 This valve was selected for speedy operation and to
reduce the manual effort and also for the modification of
the machine into automatic machine by means of using a
solenoid  valve.  A  solenoid  is  an  electrical  device  that
converts  electrical  energy  into  straight  line  motion  and
force.  These  are  also  used  to  operate  a  mechanical
operation  which  in  turn  operates  the  valve  mechanism.
Solenoids may be push type or pull type. The push type
solenoid is one in which the plunger is pushed when the
solenoid is energized electrically. The pull type solenoid
is one is  which  the plunger is pulled when the solenoid
is    energized.  The  name  of  the  parts  of  the  solenoid
should  be learned  so that  they  can  be recognized when
called  upon  to  make  repairs,  to  do  service  work  or  to
install them.

Working  Principle:  The  password  is  setted  by  the
microcontroller unit is stored in a memory space of the
unit. When the microcontroller receives the signals from
Keypad, it will be taking a decision to ON the relay when
the password is in correct otherwise the alarm will be ON.
In our project, the 16F84 is used as a microcontroller
unit.  The  input  signal  is  received  from  the  key  pad
buttons.  The  microcontroller  gives  the  output  signal  to
the relay  unit.  The  ignition  unit,  fuel  supply  (solenoid
coil) and side lock are connected to this relay, so that it
will ON at the time of relay is ON

The microcontroller compares the two signals, one is
from the  keypad  setting  time  and  another  one  is  for
already  stored  password.  The  microcontroller  gives  the
output  signal  when  the  two  passwords  are  in  matching
condition. The 4 MHz crystal oscillator is used for this
PIC microcontroller unit. In our project lead-acid battery
is  used.  The  lead-acid  batteries  output  is  given  to  the
control  unit.  Control  unit  having  two  relays,  they  are
connected to the vehicle. 

Parts of a Solenoid Valve
Coil: The solenoid coil is made of copper wire. The layers
of  wire  are  separated  by  insulating  layer.  The  entire
solenoid  coil  is  covered  with  an  varnish  that  is  not
affected by solvents, moisture, cutting oil or often fluids.
Coils are rated in various voltages such as 115 volts AC,
230  volts  AC, 460  volts AC, 575  Volts AC, 6 Volts DC,
12  Volts  DC, 24 Volts DC, 115 Volts DC and 230 Volts
DC. They are  designed for such frequencies as 50 Hz to
60 Hz.

Frame:  The  solenoid  frame  serves  several  purposes.
Since  it  is  made  of    laminated  sheets,  it  is  magnetized
when the current passes through the coil. The magnetized
coil  attracts  the  metal  plunger  to  move.  The  frame  has
provisions for attaching the mounting. They are usually
bolted or welded to  the  frame. The frame  has  provisions
for receivers, the plunger. The wear strips are mounted to
the solenoid  frame,  and  are  made  of  materials  such  as
metal or impregnated less fiber cloth.

sections  by  its  comfortable  nature.  This  is  an  era  of
automation where it is broadly defined as replacement of
manual  effort  by  electronic  power  in  all  degrees  of
automation. The operation remains an essential part of the
system  although  with  changing  demands  on  physical

position of its internal movable parts. 

 This valve was selected for speedy operation and to
reduce the manual effort and also for the modification of
the machine into automatic machine by means of using a
solenoid  valve.  A  solenoid  is  an  electrical  device  that
converts  electrical  energy  into  straight  line  motion  and
force.  These  are  also  used  to  operate  a  mechanical
operation  which  in  turn  operates  the  valve  mechanism.
Solenoids may be push type or pull type. The push type
solenoid is one in which the plunger is pushed when the
solenoid is energized electrically. The pull type solenoid
is one is  which  the plunger is pulled when the solenoid
is    energized.  The  name  of  the  parts  of  the  solenoid
should  be learned  so that  they  can  be recognized when
called  upon  to  make  repairs,  to  do  service  work  or  to
install them.

Working  Principle:  The  password  is  setted  by  the
microcontroller unit is stored in a memory space of the
unit. When the microcontroller receives the signals from
Keypad, it will be taking a decision to ON the relay when
the password is in correct otherwise the alarm will be ON.
In our project, the 16F84 is used as a microcontroller
unit.  The  input  signal  is  received  from  the  key  pad
buttons.  The  microcontroller  gives  the  output  signal  to
the relay  unit.  The  ignition  unit,  fuel  supply  (solenoid
coil) and side lock are connected to this relay, so that it
will ON at the time of relay is ON

The microcontroller compares the two signals, one is
from the  keypad  setting  time  and  another  one  is  for
already  stored  password.  The  microcontroller  gives  the
output  signal  when  the  two  passwords  are  in  matching
condition. The 4 MHz crystal oscillator is used for this
PIC microcontroller unit. In our project lead-acid battery
is  used.  The  lead-acid  batteries  output  is  given  to  the
control  unit.  Control  unit  having  two  relays,  they  are
connected to the vehicle. 

Parts of a Solenoid Valve
Coil: The solenoid coil is made of copper wire. The layers
of  wire  are  separated  by  insulating  layer.  The  entire
solenoid  coil  is  covered  with  an  varnish  that  is  not
affected by solvents, moisture, cutting oil or often fluids.
Coils are rated in various voltages such as 115 volts AC,
230  volts  AC, 460  volts AC, 575  Volts AC, 6 Volts DC,
12  Volts  DC, 24 Volts DC, 115 Volts DC and 230 Volts
DC. They are  designed for such frequencies as 50 Hz to
60 Hz.

Frame:  The  solenoid  frame  serves  several  purposes.
Since  it  is  made  of    laminated  sheets,  it  is  magnetized
when the current passes through the coil. The magnetized
coil  attracts  the  metal  plunger  to  move.  The  frame  has
provisions for attaching the mounting. They are usually
bolted or welded to  the  frame. The frame  has  provisions
for receivers, the plunger. The wear strips are mounted to
the solenoid  frame,  and  are  made  of  materials  such  as
metal or impregnated less fiber cloth.

Solenoid  Plunger:  The  Solenoid  plunger  is  the  mover
mechanism of the solenoid. The plunger is made of steel
laminations  which  are  riveted  together  under  high
pressure,  so  that  there  will  be  no  movement  of  the
lamination with respect to one another. At the top of the
plunger a pin hole is placed for making a connection to
some  device.  The  solenoid  plunger  is  moved  by a
magnetic force in one direction and is usually returned by
spring action. Solenoid  operated  valves  are  usually
provided with cover over either the solenoid or the entire
valve.  This  protects  the  solenoid  from  dirt  and  other
foreign  matter,  and  protects  the  actuator.  In  many
applications  it  is  necessary  to  use  explosion  proof
solenoids.

setting password.
Receiving problem is restricted.
This project provides another facility to change the
password.
Wrong password three times only allowed.

vehicle

CONCLUSION

A strong  multidiscipline 

team  with  a  good
engineering  base  is  necessary  for  the  Development  and

refinement    of    advanced      computer      programming,
editing   techniques,   diagnostic   Software,  algorithms
for    the    dynamic  exchange  of  informational  different
levels  of  hierarchy. Simulation  techniques are suitable
for  solving  some  of    the  problems.  But    a  good
quantitative    model  and  a  test  set-up  will  help  to
understand    the    systems.  This    project    work  has
provided  us  an  excellent opportunity  and  experience,
to  use  our    limited    knowledge.  We  gained  a  lot  of
practical  knowledge  regarding,  planning,  purchasing,
assembling    and    machining    while    doing  this  project
work.    We    feel    that    the      project      work    is  a  good
solution  to  bridge  the  gates  between  institution  and
industries.

We are  proud  that  we have completed  the work
with the limited time successfully. The INTELLIGENT
CAR  SECURITY  SYSTEM  is working with satisfactory
conditions. We are able to understand the difficulties in
maintaining  the  tolerances  and  also  quality.  We  have
done  to  our  ability  and  skill  making  maximum  use  of
available facilities. In conclusion remarks of our project
work, let us add a few more lines about our impression
project work. Thus we have developed a “INTELLIGENT
CAR SECURITY SYSTEM” which helps to know how to
achieve low cost automation. By using more techniques,
they  can  be  modified  and  developed  according  to  the
applications.
