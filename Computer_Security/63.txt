1. INTRODUCTION 

Radio-frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  a  technology  that  uses  communication  via  electromagnetic  waves  to 
exchange data between a terminal and an electronic tag attached to an object, for the purpose of identification 
and tracking. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Radio-
frequency  identification  involves  interrogators  (also  known  as  readers),  and  tags  (also  known  as  labels).  Most 
RFID  tags  contain  at  least  two  parts.  One  is  an  integrated  circuit  for  storing  and  processing  information, 
modulating  and  demodulating  a  radio-frequency  (RF)  signal,  and  other  specialized  functions.  The  other  is  an 
antenna  for  receiving  and  transmitting  the  signal.  Nowadays  RFID  systems  are  used  for  asset  management, 
inventory  control,  security  system,  animal  tracking,  keyless  entry,  automatic  toll  debiting.  RFID  is  wireless, 
means non-contacting technique range from inches to feet. Tag and reader can be reusable as it is programmable 
device.  The  project  is  based  on  the  principle  of  An Active  Reader  Passive  Tag (ARPT)  system  which  has  an 
active  reader  that  transmits  interrogator  signals  and  also  receives  authentication  replies  from  passive  tags. 
There are several other security systems such as biometric scanners, retina scanners, voice recognition, barcode 
scanners etc. However, the RFID module is much more economically feasible, and is very standardized, i.e. it 
does not vary from person to person.

stored in the database. If the card number matches a card stored in the database then the microcontroller opens a

to the off-time. The resulting voltage, which is seen by the motor, is the average voltage over the period. It is 
easily calculated using the following formula: 

   

 

 

VOUT=VAVG = VPWM * (Duty Cycle).                                                                (1) 

We can see from the formula that we can adjust the voltage by changing the Duty Cycle. For the given motor, 
we have a 5V PWM signal and 20% duty cycle (since the off time is 5 seconds). VOUT is the voltage controlling 
the servo motor. 
                             VOUT = VPWM * (Duty Cycle)  
                              VOUT = 5V * 20% 
                              VOUT = 5V * 0.20 
                              VOUT = 1V.  
The voltage received at the server motor will be 1V. If we want to increase the output voltage, we simply have 
to rearrange the given formula as:  

Duty Cycle = (VOUT/VPWM.)

This means that controlling the speed of the motor, the vibration frequency and also the vibration strength, can 
easily  be  achieved  by  altering  the  PWM  signal’s  Duty  Cycle  in  the  microcontroller.  The  advantage  of  this 
technique  is  that  the  microcontroller  can  make  a  simple  adjustment  to  its  output  depending  upon  the  input 
conditions and its program 

 
4. RFID TAG SESSION 
The RFID system consists of reader and tag. There are three types of RFID tags: passive RFID tags, which have 
no power source and require an external electromagnetic field to initiate a signal transmission, active RFID tags, 
which contain a battery and can transmit  signals once an external source ('Interrogator')  has been successfully 
identified, and battery assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags, which require an external source to wake up but have 
significant  higher  forward  link  capability  providing  greater  range.  Presently  we  are  dealing  with  passive  tags. 
Tags  consists  of  a  silicon  device  and  antenna  circuit.  The  purpose  of  the  antenna  circuit  is  to  induce  an 
energizing signal and to send a  modulated RF  signal. Our  tag uses  FSK  modulation. This form of  modulation 
uses two different frequencies for data transfer; the most common FSK mode is FC/8/10. In other words, a ‘0’ is 
transmitted as an amplitude modulated clock cycle  with period corresponding to the carrier frequency divided 
by  8,  and  a  ‘1’  is  transmitted  as  an  amplitude-modulated  clock  cycle  period  corresponding  to  the  carrier 
frequency  divided  by  10.  The  amplitude  modulation  of  the  carrier  thus  switches  from  FC/8  to  FC/10 
corresponding to 0’s and 1’s in the bit stream, and the reader has only to count cycles between the peak-detected 
clock edges to decode the data. FSK allows for a simple reader design, provides very strong noise immunity, but 
suffers from a lower data rate than some other forms of data modulation.  
 
4.1 RFID READER SESSION 
The  reader  circuit  should  provide  125  KHz  carrier  signal  to  the  tag  and  detect  the  modulated  signal  via 
Backscatter  modulation. This  terminology refers to the communication  method used by a passive  RFID tag to 
send  data  to  the  reader  using  the  same  reader’s  carrier  signal.  The  incoming  RF  carrier  signal  to  the  tag  is 
transmitted  back  to  the  reader  with  tag’s  data.  The  RF  voltage  induced  in  the  tag’s  antenna  is  amplitude-
modulated by the modulation signal (data) of tag device

                              VOUT = 1V.  
The voltage received at the server motor will be 1V. If we want to increase the output voltage, we simply have 
to rearrange the given formula as:  

Duty Cycle = (VOUT/VPWM.)

This means that controlling the speed of the motor, the vibration frequency and also the vibration strength, can 
easily  be  achieved  by  altering  the  PWM  signal’s  Duty  Cycle  in  the  microcontroller.  The  advantage  of  this 
technique  is  that  the  microcontroller  can  make  a  simple  adjustment  to  its  output  depending  upon  the  input 
conditions and its program 

 
4. RFID TAG SESSION 
The RFID system consists of reader and tag. There are three types of RFID tags: passive RFID tags, which have 
no power source and require an external electromagnetic field to initiate a signal transmission, active RFID tags, 
which contain a battery and can transmit  signals once an external source ('Interrogator')  has been successfully 
identified, and battery assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags, which require an external source to wake up but have 
significant  higher  forward  link  capability  providing  greater  range.  Presently  we  are  dealing  with  passive  tags. 
Tags  consists  of  a  silicon  device  and  antenna  circuit.  The  purpose  of  the  antenna  circuit  is  to  induce  an 
energizing signal and to send a  modulated RF  signal. Our  tag uses  FSK  modulation. This form of  modulation 
uses two different frequencies for data transfer; the most common FSK mode is FC/8/10. In other words, a ‘0’ is 
transmitted as an amplitude modulated clock cycle  with period corresponding to the carrier frequency divided 
by  8,  and  a  ‘1’  is  transmitted  as  an  amplitude-modulated  clock  cycle  period  corresponding  to  the  carrier 
frequency  divided  by  10.  The  amplitude  modulation  of  the  carrier  thus  switches  from  FC/8  to  FC/10 
corresponding to 0’s and 1’s in the bit stream, and the reader has only to count cycles between the peak-detected 
clock edges to decode the data. FSK allows for a simple reader design, provides very strong noise immunity, but 
suffers from a lower data rate than some other forms of data modulation.  
 
4.1 RFID READER SESSION 
The  reader  circuit  should  provide  125  KHz  carrier  signal  to  the  tag  and  detect  the  modulated  signal  via 
Backscatter  modulation. This  terminology refers to the communication  method used by a passive  RFID tag to 
send  data  to  the  reader  using  the  same  reader’s  carrier  signal.  The  incoming  RF  carrier  signal  to  the  tag  is 
transmitted  back  to  the  reader  with  tag’s  data.  The  RF  voltage  induced  in  the  tag’s  antenna  is  amplitude-
modulated by the modulation signal (data) of tag device

CONCLUSIONS 
Thus it is observed that the RFID security system is a good basic security system. It is not very strong physically 
and  does  not  have  a  very  complicated  encryption  system  but  has  a  very  good  use  in  basic  security,  like  for 
places  which  have entry on  for authorized personnel carrying cards. This not only reduces a guard that  has to 
check  every  id  but  also  speed  up  the  process.  RFID  proves  to  be  indispensable  for  a  variety  of  automated 
applications  involving  data  acquisition  and  object  identification.  The  major  advantage  of  all  kinds  of  RFID 
system  is  that  they  work  contactless  and  require  no  line  of  sight.  Transponders  can  be  read  through  a  whole 
number of substances, e.g. snow, fog, ice, paint, dirt, and in difficult constructional scenarios where barcodes or 
other optical reading technologies  would be no use at all. RFID transponders can be read at remarkable speed 
even  in  difficult  conditions,  and  in  most  cases  respond  in  less  than  100  milliseconds.  The  reading/writing 
capability of an active RFID system is also a significant advantage in interactive applications, e.g. when tracking 
products in process or maintenance jobs. In difficult external conditions RFID has the advantage of being able to 
communicate contactless and without direct line-of-sight contact with the data medium. Where the transponder 
is doesn't matter either -- it can be read through substances like dust, paint or ice. 
Active  RFID  tags  contain  a  chip  and  a  power  source  while  passive  tags  get  their  power  from  the scanner 
radio waves and are less costly. Both are more expensive than bar codes. The cost is justified if sensors have to 
read hidden or obscured tags, but for tags that are in line-of-sight for readers, bar codes and image ID are much 
less expensive alternatives. Image ID scanners, which read a colored dot or other image, can scan a whole pallet 
in seconds as long as the images are visible from the outside. While an RFID tag can encrypt its data that adds to 
the already high cost. Without encryption, a company's competitors or other unfriendly organizations can read 
the  tags  when  the  material  is  in  transit  and  obtain  sensitive  or  confidential  information.  Image  ID  systems 
require line-of-sight  scanning like bar codes but  use non-directional images. Each image encodes a  unique ID 
that the system uses to call up individual product data from a database. Without access to the database,  the ID 
has no sensitive information and the data remains secure. 
When manufacturers insert RFID tags in products, the tag is often integrated permanently. After a sale, the tag 
continues to carry its ID. Consumers who purchase such a product run the risk of being tracked. Stores or other 
organizations  could  theoretically  place  RFID  readers  at  their  entrances  and  identify  visitors  and  some  of  their 
past  purchases.  Bar-code  readers  do  not  have  the  range  to  scan  at  a  distance  and  are  more  privacy-friendly  in 
that respect. 
RFID  tags  have  problems  common  to  all  radio-frequency  transmissions  and  the  tags  themselves  may  cause 
errors. Metal reflects and blocks radio waves, and some frequencies suffer from interference. More than one tag 
may  reply  at  one  time,  causing  reception  errors.  If  all  tag  messages  don't  get  through,  the  totals  for  pallets  or 
inventories contain mistakes. Image ID systems don't suffer from the same problems. As long as the scanner can 
see the images, it can read them. 
All the leading companies use RFID security for their employees. Furthermore even the Bangalore metro station 
uses RFID tokens as a ticket which also stores information about the destination. Therefore it is a breakthrough 
technology as it is wireless and less complicated and can be implemented and expanded in various ways
