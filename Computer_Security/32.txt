Abstract:  Now  a  day’s  so  many  useful  technologies  are 
coming  out  to  make  our  life  style  more  comfort,  luxurious 
and  secure,  with  these  latest  advanced  technologies  we  are 
providing  sophisticated  security  systems.  The  main  aim  of 
this project is to provide high security to the ATMs with the 
help of advance technologies like android Application, GSM 
and Bluetooth technology. To communicate with modules we 
need a powerful and fast processing micro controller, for this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller.  In  this  system,  Bluetooth  technology  is  used  in 
level1  security  layer,  it  asks  mobile  password  which  should 
be  entered  from  android  mobile,  send  virtual  password  via 
Bluetooth  communication  to  micro  controller,  then  it  checks 
second  level  using  GSM  technology,  then  controller  sends 
one time password to pre register mobile number. If the user 
has that mobile with him then only he can see  that password 
and  allowed  to  next  level  of  security  by  entering  it  using 
keypad and status will be displayed in LCD.

I. INTRODUCTION 

      A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is 
a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic 
access to his or her bank account(s) at a financial institution. 
The card, where accepted, can be used instead of cash  when 
making  purchases.  Debit  cards  usually  also  allow  for  instant 
withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card for withdrawing 
cash.  Merchants  may  also  offer  cash  back  facilities  to 
customers,  where  a  customer  can  withdraw  cash  along  with 
their  purchase.  A  personal  identification  number  (PIN, 
pronounced  "pin")  is  a  numeric  password  shared  between  a 
user and a system that can be used to authenticate the user to 
the  system.  Typically,  the  user  is  required  to  provide  a  non-
confidential  user  identifier  or  token  (the  user  ID)  and  a 
confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving 
the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon 
the  user  ID  and  compares  the  looked-up  PIN  with  the 
received  PIN.  The  user  is  granted  access  only  when  the 
number  entered  matches  with  the  number  stored  in  the 
system.  Hence,  despite  the  name,  a  PIN  does  not  personally 
identify  the  user.  In  this  project,  we  present  a  password 

protection  scheme  that  involves  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing  in  an  Internet-based  environment  or  a  ATM 
machine,  which  will  be  resistant  to  phishing  scams,  Trojan 
horses,  and  shoulder  surfing  attacks.  We  propose  a  virtual 
password  concept  involving  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing 
in  online 
to 
environments.  

secure  users’  passwords 

    We propose differentiated security mechanisms in which a 
user  has  the  freedom  to  choose  a  virtual  password  scheme 
ranging from weak security to strong security. The tradeoff is 
that  stronger  schemes  are  more  complex.  Among  the 
schemes, we have a default method (i.e., traditional password 
scheme),  a  system  recommended  function,  a  user-specified 
function,  a  user-specified  program,  and  so  on.  A  function/ 
program  is  used  to  implement  the  virtual  password  concept 
by  trading  security  for  complexity  by  requiring  a  small 
amount  of  human  computing.  We  further  propose  several 
functions  to  serve  as  system  recommended  functions  and 
provide  a  security  analysis.  We  analyze  how  the  proposed 
schemes  defend  against  phishing,  key  logger,  shoulder-
surfing,  and  multiple  attacks.  In  user-specified  functions,  we 
adopt secret little functions in which security is enhanced by 
hiding  secret  functions/algorithms.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  our  virtual  password  mechanism  is  the  first  one 
which is able to defend against all three attacks. The proposed 
functions  include  secret  little  functions  and  two  other 
schemes called codebook and reference switching functions.  

    Our  objective  is  to  produce  a  function  achieving  both:  1) 
ease  of  computation;  and  2)  security.  However,  since 
simplicity and security conflict, it is difficult to achieve both. 
The  idea  of  this  paper  is  to  add  some  complexity,  through 
user  computations  performed  by  heart/hand  or  computation 
devices,  to  prevent  the  three  kinds  of  attacks.  There  is  a 
tradeoff of how complex the computation by the users can be. 
One goal is to find an easy to compute but secure scheme for 
computing.  To  communicate  with  modules  we  need  a 
powerful  and  fast  processing  micro  controller,  for  this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller. For this SMS purpose we are using SIM900 GSM 
modem,  which  supports  Quad-Band  850/  900/  1800/  1900 
MHz  frequencies  and  the  data  format  is  UART  with  default

baud  rate  is  9600  bps  ,and  it  is  operated  through  AT 
commands.  

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

    In  this  section  some  related  works  are  discussed  below. 
The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  increase  the  security  that 
customer use the ATM machine. Once user's bank card is lost 
and the password is stolen, the criminal will draw all cash in 
the shortest time, which will bring enormous financial losses 
to  customer,  so  to  rectify  this  problem  we  are  implementing 
this  project.  The  chip  of  LPC2148  is  used  for  the  core  of 
microprocessor  in  ARM7.  An  automated  teller  machine 
(ATM) or cash machine is an electronic device that allows a 
bank’s  customers  to  make  cash  withdrawals  and  check  their 
account  balances  without  the  need  or  human  teller.  Many 
ATMs also allow people to deposit cash or cheques, transfer 
money  between  their  bank  ac-  counts,  top  up  their  mobile 
phones prepaid or even buy post- age stamps. In most modern 
ATMs,  the  customer  identifies  him  or  herself  by  inserting  a 
plastic  card  with  magnetic  strip  or  plastic  smart  card  with  a 
chip  that  contains  his  or  her  account  number.  The  customer 
then verifies his or her identity by entering a pass code (i.e.) 
personal  identification  number  (PIN)  of  four  digits.  If  the 
number  is  entered  incorrectly  several  times  consecutively 
(usually three), most ATMs will retain the card as a security 
precaution  to  prevent  an  unauthorized  user  form  discovering 
the PIN by guesswork and so on.  

   Moreover  there  is  a  limitation  in  transaction  for  the  other 
bank  customers  in  using  the  ATM  of  some  other  bank 
crossing  the  limit  they  have  to  pay  transaction  fees.  In  [9], 
one  more  approach  using  GSM  technology  to  communicate 
with the remote devices via SMS is remote  metering system, 
in  this  paper  illustrates  a  technique  for  remotely  reading 
electricity  meter  readings  using  SMS.  Both  postpaid  and 
prepaid  are  feasible  to  implement  using  this  architecture  as 
SMS  based  data  gathering  can  be  done  very  quickly  and 
efficiently.  In  [10]  [11],  this  paper  projected  a  Zigbee-GSM 
based  Monitoring  and  Remote  Control  System.  In  this 
systems  used  both  Zigbee  and  GSM  for  communicating 
between user and devices. This system allows user to monitor 
and  control  devices  in  the  home  through  a  number  of 
controls, including a Zigbee based remote control. Users may 
remotely monitor and control their home devices using GSM. 
In [12], the most important objective of the paper is to design 
and develop a highly developed vehicle locking system in the 
real  time  situation.  The  design  &  development  of  a  theft 
control  system  for  an  automobile,  which  is  being  used  to 
prevent/control the theft of a vehicle.  

    This  system  consists  of  an  embedded  system  and  Global 
System  Mobile  communication  (GSM)  technology.  This 
system  developed  by  Pravada  P.  Wan  hade  and  Prof.  S.O. 
Dahad,  the  developed  system  is  installed  in  the  vehicle.  The 
mobile  is  connected  to  the  microcontroller,  which  is  in  turn, 
connected to the engine. Once, the vehicle is being stolen, the 
information  is  being  used  by  the  vehicle  owner  for  further 
processing.  The  information  is  passed  onto  the  central 
processing insurance system which is in the form of the SMS, 
the  microcontroller  unit  reads  the  SMS  and  sends  it  to  the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) module and says to lock it 
or  to  stop  the  engine  immediately.  The  main  concept  of  this 

paper  vehicle  is  controlled  by  GSM  and  GPS.  The  designed 
unit  is  reliable  and  efficient  system  for  providing  security  to 
the vehicles through GSM, GPS and serial communication. In 
this  project  we  proposed  the  RFID  based  GSM  security 
system  can  be  implemented  easily  for  secure  the  ATM 
machine.  In  this  system  the  working  of  these  ATM  machine 
is  when  the  customer  place  on  the  RFID  module  when  it 
access the ATM for draw the cash then, the machine wants to 
RFID  of  that  user’s  which  use  the  machine.  Using  one  time 
password,  it  verify/identify  ID  and  gives  accurate  result  that 
if  it  valid  or  not  valid.  In  this  way  we  can  try  to  control  the 
crime circle of ATM and do secure it.  

III. HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 

PROJECT 

A. Introduction 
   This chapter briefly explains about the Hardware Impleme-
ntation of the project. It discusses the design and working of 
the design with the help of block diagram and circuit diagram 
and  explanation  of  circuit  diagram  in  detail.  It  explains  the 
features,timer programming, serial communication, interrupts 
of  LPC2148  microcontroller.  It  also  explains  the  various 
modules used in this project. Hardware implementation deals 
in drawing the schematic on the plane paper according to the 
application, testing the schematic design over the breadboard 
using  the  various  IC’s  to  find  if  the  design  meets  the 
objective, carrying out the PCB layout of the schematic tested 
on  breadboard,  finally  preparing  the  board  and  testing  the 
designed hardware.

Global Positioning System (GPS) module and says to lock it 
or  to  stop  the  engine  immediately.  The  main  concept  of  this 

paper  vehicle  is  controlled  by  GSM  and  GPS.  The  designed 
unit  is  reliable  and  efficient  system  for  providing  security  to 
the vehicles through GSM, GPS and serial communication. In 
this  project  we  proposed  the  RFID  based  GSM  security 
system  can  be  implemented  easily  for  secure  the  ATM 
machine.  In  this  system  the  working  of  these  ATM  machine 
is  when  the  customer  place  on  the  RFID  module  when  it 
access the ATM for draw the cash then, the machine wants to 
RFID  of  that  user’s  which  use  the  machine.  Using  one  time 
password,  it  verify/identify  ID  and  gives  accurate  result  that 
if  it  valid  or  not  valid.  In  this  way  we  can  try  to  control  the 
crime circle of ATM and do secure it.

B. Modules Used In Proposed System 
1. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for 
exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength 
UHF  radio  waves  in  the  ISM  band  from  2.4  to  2.485 GHz) 
from  fixed  and  mobile  devices  and  building  personal  area 
networks  (PANs).  Invented  by  telecom  vendor  Ericsson  in 
1994, it  was originally conceived as a  wireless alternative to 
RS-232  data  cables.  It  can  connect  several  devices, 
overcoming  problems  of  synchronization.  It  gets  its  name 
from a Scandinavian king that united the Danes; because it is 
meant to unify communication protocols over short range into 

a  single  protocol.  Bluetooth  technology  features  low  power 
consumption,  low  cost,  and  security.  It  operates  in  the  ISM 
(Industrial Scientific Medical) Band of 2.4-2.83 GHz. 

2.  GSM  Modem:  Communication  among  vehicle,  Owner, 
police  and  emergency  is  established  accordingly  as  per 
requirement  through  GSM  (Global  Service  for  Mobile 
communication).  A  GSM  modem  is  a  specialized  type  of 
modem  which  accepts  a  SIM  card,  and  operates  over  a 
subscription  to  a  mobile  operator,  just  like  a  mobile  phone. 
From  the  mobile  operator  perspective,  a  GSM  modem  looks 
just like a mobile phone. A GSM modem can be a dedicated 
modem device with a serial, USB or Bluetooth connection or 
it  may  be  a  mobile  phone  that  provides  GSM  modem 
capabilities.  A  GSM  modem  could  also  be  a  standard  GSM 
mobile  phone  the  appropriate  cable  and  software  driver  to 
connect to a serial port or USB port on our computer.

the 
microcontroller so that it can control the operation of the IC’s 
used  in  the  implementation.  In  the  present  work,  we  have 
used  the  Orcad  design  software  for  PCB  circuit  design,  the 
Keil µv4 software development tool to write and compile the 
source  code,  which  has  been  written  in  the  C  language.  The 
Flash magic programmer has been used to write this compile 
code into the microcontroller.  
Software Tools Required: 

  Orcad 
  Keil  µVision4 
  Flash Magic 

   Orcad  is  used  for  drawing  the  schematic  diagram,  it  is 
mentioned  above.  Keilµv4,  Flashmagic  are  the  two  software 
tools  used  to  program  microcontroller.  The  working  of  each 
software tool is explained below in detail. 

1.  Programming  Code  Description:  A  compiler  for  a  high 
level  language  helps  to  reduce  production  time.  To  program 
the  LPC2148  microcontroller  the  Keil  µv4  is  used.  The 
programming  is  done  in  the  embedded  C  language  or 
Assembly  language.  Keil  µv4  is  a  suite  of  executable,  open 
source  software  development  tools  for  the  microcontrollers 
hosted  on  the  Windows  platform.  One  of  the  difficulties  of 
programming  microcontrollers  is  the  limited  amount  of 
resources  the  programmer  has  to  deal  with.  In  personal 
computers  resources  such  as  RAM  and  processing  speed  are 
basically  limitless  when  compared  to  microcontrollers.  In 
contrast,  the  code  on  microcontrollers  should  be  as  low  on 
resources as possible. 

2. Keil Compiler:  Keil compiler is  software used  where the 
machine  language  code  is  written  and  compiled.  After 
compilation,  the  machine  source  code  is  converted  into  hex 
code  which  is  to  be  dumped  into  the  microcontroller  for 
further  processing.  Keil  compiler  also  supports  C  language 
code.  The  compilation  of  the  C  program  converts  it  into 
machine  language  file  (.hex).  This  is  the  only  language  the 
microcontroller  will  understand,  because  it  contains  the

I. INTRODUCTION 

      A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is 
a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic 
access to his or her bank account(s) at a financial institution. 
The card, where accepted, can be used instead of cash  when 
making  purchases.  Debit  cards  usually  also  allow  for  instant 
withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card for withdrawing 
cash.  Merchants  may  also  offer  cash  back  facilities  to 
customers,  where  a  customer  can  withdraw  cash  along  with 
their  purchase.  A  personal  identification  number  (PIN, 
pronounced  "pin")  is  a  numeric  password  shared  between  a 
user and a system that can be used to authenticate the user to 
the  system.  Typically,  the  user  is  required  to  provide  a  non-
confidential  user  identifier  or  token  (the  user  ID)  and  a 
confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving 
the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon 
the  user  ID  and  compares  the  looked-up  PIN  with  the 
received  PIN.  The  user  is  granted  access  only  when  the 
number  entered  matches  with  the  number  stored  in  the 
system.  Hence,  despite  the  name,  a  PIN  does  not  personally 
identify  the  user.  In  this  project,  we  present  a  password 

protection  scheme  that  involves  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing  in  an  Internet-based  environment  or  a  ATM 
machine,  which  will  be  resistant  to  phishing  scams,  Trojan 
horses,  and  shoulder  surfing  attacks.  We  propose  a  virtual 
password  concept  involving  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing 
in  online 
to 
environments.  

secure  users’  passwords 

    We propose differentiated security mechanisms in which a 
user  has  the  freedom  to  choose  a  virtual  password  scheme 
ranging from weak security to strong security. The tradeoff is 
that  stronger  schemes  are  more  complex.  Among  the 
schemes, we have a default method (i.e., traditional password 
scheme),  a  system  recommended  function,  a  user-specified 
function,  a  user-specified  program,  and  so  on.  A  function/ 
program  is  used  to  implement  the  virtual  password  concept 
by  trading  security  for  complexity  by  requiring  a  small 
amount  of  human  computing.  We  further  propose  several 
functions  to  serve  as  system  recommended  functions  and 
provide  a  security  analysis.  We  analyze  how  the  proposed 
schemes  defend  against  phishing,  key  logger,  shoulder-
surfing,  and  multiple  attacks.  In  user-specified  functions,  we 
adopt secret little functions in which security is enhanced by 
hiding  secret  functions/algorithms.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  our  virtual  password  mechanism  is  the  first  one 
which is able to defend against all three attacks. The proposed 
functions  include  secret  little  functions  and  two  other 
schemes called codebook and reference switching functions.  

    Our  objective  is  to  produce  a  function  achieving  both:  1) 
ease  of  computation;  and  2)  security.  However,  since 
simplicity and security conflict, it is difficult to achieve both. 
The  idea  of  this  paper  is  to  add  some  complexity,  through 
user  computations  performed  by  heart/hand  or  computation 
devices,  to  prevent  the  three  kinds  of  attacks.  There  is  a 
tradeoff of how complex the computation by the users can be. 
One goal is to find an easy to compute but secure scheme for 
computing.  To  communicate  with  modules  we  need  a 
powerful  and  fast  processing  micro  controller,  for  this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller. For this SMS purpose we are using SIM900 GSM 
modem,  which  supports  Quad-Band  850/  900/  1800/  1900 
MHz  frequencies  and  the  data  format  is  UART  with  default

baud  rate  is  9600  bps  ,and  it  is  operated  through  AT 
commands.  

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

    In  this  section  some  related  works  are  discussed  below. 
The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  increase  the  security  that 
customer use the ATM machine. Once user's bank card is lost 
and the password is stolen, the criminal will draw all cash in 
the shortest time, which will bring enormous financial losses 
to  customer,  so  to  rectify  this  problem  we  are  implementing 
this  project.  The  chip  of  LPC2148  is  used  for  the  core  of 
microprocessor  in  ARM7.  An  automated  teller  machine 
(ATM) or cash machine is an electronic device that allows a 
bank’s  customers  to  make  cash  withdrawals  and  check  their 
account  balances  without  the  need  or  human  teller.  Many 
ATMs also allow people to deposit cash or cheques, transfer 
money  between  their  bank  ac-  counts,  top  up  their  mobile 
phones prepaid or even buy post- age stamps. In most modern 
ATMs,  the  customer  identifies  him  or  herself  by  inserting  a 
plastic  card  with  magnetic  strip  or  plastic  smart  card  with  a 
chip  that  contains  his  or  her  account  number.  The  customer 
then verifies his or her identity by entering a pass code (i.e.) 
personal  identification  number  (PIN)  of  four  digits.  If  the 
number  is  entered  incorrectly  several  times  consecutively 
(usually three), most ATMs will retain the card as a security 
precaution  to  prevent  an  unauthorized  user  form  discovering 
the PIN by guesswork and so on.  

   Moreover  there  is  a  limitation  in  transaction  for  the  other 
bank  customers  in  using  the  ATM  of  some  other  bank 
crossing  the  limit  they  have  to  pay  transaction  fees.  In  [9], 
one  more  approach  using  GSM  technology  to  communicate 
with the remote devices via SMS is remote  metering system, 
in  this  paper  illustrates  a  technique  for  remotely  reading 
electricity  meter  readings  using  SMS.  Both  postpaid  and 
prepaid  are  feasible  to  implement  using  this  architecture  as 
SMS  based  data  gathering  can  be  done  very  quickly  and 
efficiently.  In  [10]  [11],  this  paper  projected  a  Zigbee-GSM 
based  Monitoring  and  Remote  Control  System.  In  this 
systems  used  both  Zigbee  and  GSM  for  communicating 
between user and devices. This system allows user to monitor 
and  control  devices  in  the  home  through  a  number  of 
controls, including a Zigbee based remote control. Users may 
remotely monitor and control their home devices using GSM. 
In [12], the most important objective of the paper is to design 
and develop a highly developed vehicle locking system in the 
real  time  situation.  The  design  &  development  of  a  theft 
control  system  for  an  automobile,  which  is  being  used  to 
prevent/control the theft of a vehicle.  

    This  system  consists  of  an  embedded  system  and  Global 
System  Mobile  communication  (GSM)  technology.  This 
system  developed  by  Pravada  P.  Wan  hade  and  Prof.  S.O. 
Dahad,  the  developed  system  is  installed  in  the  vehicle.  The 
mobile  is  connected  to  the  microcontroller,  which  is  in  turn, 
connected to the engine. Once, the vehicle is being stolen, the 
information  is  being  used  by  the  vehicle  owner  for  further 
processing.  The  information  is  passed  onto  the  central 
processing insurance system which is in the form of the SMS, 
the  microcontroller  unit  reads  the  SMS  and  sends  it  to  the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) module and says to lock it 
or  to  stop  the  engine  immediately.  The  main  concept  of  this 

paper  vehicle  is  controlled  by  GSM  and  GPS.  The  designed 
unit  is  reliable  and  efficient  system  for  providing  security  to 
the vehicles through GSM, GPS and serial communication. In 
this  project  we  proposed  the  RFID  based  GSM  security 
system  can  be  implemented  easily  for  secure  the  ATM 
machine.  In  this  system  the  working  of  these  ATM  machine 
is  when  the  customer  place  on  the  RFID  module  when  it 
access the ATM for draw the cash then, the machine wants to 
RFID  of  that  user’s  which  use  the  machine.  Using  one  time

if  it  valid  or  not  valid.  In  this  way  we  can  try  to  control  the 
crime circle of ATM and do secure it.

   Orcad  is  used  for  drawing  the  schematic  diagram,  it  is 
mentioned  above.  Keilµv4,  Flashmagic  are  the  two  software 
tools  used  to  program  microcontroller.  The  working  of  each 
software tool is explained below in detail. 

1.  Programming  Code  Description:  A  compiler  for  a  high 
level  language  helps  to  reduce  production  time.  To  program 
the  LPC2148  microcontroller  the  Keil  µv4  is  used.  The 
programming  is  done  in  the  embedded  C  language  or 
Assembly  language.  Keil  µv4  is  a  suite  of  executable,  open 
source  software  development  tools  for  the  microcontrollers 
hosted  on  the  Windows  platform.  One  of  the  difficulties  of 
programming  microcontrollers  is  the  limited  amount  of 
resources  the  programmer  has  to  deal  with.  In  personal 
computers  resources  such  as  RAM  and  processing  speed  are 
basically  limitless  when  compared  to  microcontrollers.  In 
contrast,  the  code  on  microcontrollers  should  be  as  low  on 
resources as possible. 

2. Keil Compiler:  Keil compiler is  software used  where the 
machine  language  code  is  written  and  compiled.  After 
compilation,  the  machine  source  code  is  converted  into  hex 
code  which  is  to  be  dumped  into  the  microcontroller  for 
further  processing.  Keil  compiler  also  supports  C  language 
code.  The  compilation  of  the  C  program  converts  it  into 
machine  language  file  (.hex).  This  is  the  only  language  the 
microcontroller  will  understand,  because  it  contains  the

During  this  step  there  are  some  warnings  about  eventual 
errors in the program. If there are no errors and warnings then 
run  the  program,  the  system  performs  all  the  required  tasks 
and  behaves  as  expected  the  software  developed.  If  not,  the

Abstract:  Now  a  day’s  so  many  useful  technologies  are 
coming  out  to  make  our  life  style  more  comfort,  luxurious 
and  secure,  with  these  latest  advanced  technologies  we  are 
providing  sophisticated  security  systems.  The  main  aim  of 
this project is to provide high security to the ATMs with the 
help of advance technologies like android Application, GSM 
and Bluetooth technology. To communicate with modules we 
need a powerful and fast processing micro controller, for this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller.  In  this  system,  Bluetooth  technology  is  used  in 
level1  security  layer,  it  asks  mobile  password  which  should 
be  entered  from  android  mobile,  send  virtual  password  via 
Bluetooth  communication  to  micro  controller,  then  it  checks 
second  level  using  GSM  technology,  then  controller  sends 
one time password to pre register mobile number. If the user 
has that mobile with him then only he can see  that password 
and  allowed  to  next  level  of  security  by  entering  it  using 
keypad and status will be displayed in LCD. 

Keywords:  GSM  and  Bluetooth  Technology,  ARM7, 
Keypad and LCD. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

      A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is 
a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic 
access to his or her bank account(s) at a financial institution. 
The card, where accepted, can be used instead of cash  when 
making  purchases.  Debit  cards  usually  also  allow  for  instant 
withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card for withdrawing 
cash.  Merchants  may  also  offer  cash  back  facilities  to 
customers,  where  a  customer  can  withdraw  cash  along  with 
their  purchase.  A  personal  identification  number  (PIN, 
pronounced  "pin")  is  a  numeric  password  shared  between  a 
user and a system that can be used to authenticate the user to 
the  system.  Typically,  the  user  is  required  to  provide  a  non-
confidential  user  identifier  or  token  (the  user  ID)  and  a 
confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving 
the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon 
the  user  ID  and  compares  the  looked-up  PIN  with  the 
received  PIN.  The  user  is  granted  access  only  when  the 
number  entered  matches  with  the  number  stored  in  the 
system.  Hence,  despite  the  name,  a  PIN  does  not  personally 
identify  the  user.  In  this  project,  we  present  a  password 

protection  scheme  that  involves  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing  in  an  Internet-based  environment  or  a  ATM 
machine,  which  will  be  resistant  to  phishing  scams,  Trojan 
horses,  and  shoulder  surfing  attacks.  We  propose  a  virtual 
password  concept  involving  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing 
in  online 
to 
environments.  

secure  users’  passwords 

    We propose differentiated security mechanisms in which a 
user  has  the  freedom  to  choose  a  virtual  password  scheme 
ranging from weak security to strong security. The tradeoff is 
that  stronger  schemes  are  more  complex.  Among  the 
schemes, we have a default method (i.e., traditional password 
scheme),  a  system  recommended  function,  a  user-specified 
function,  a  user-specified  program,  and  so  on.  A  function/ 
program  is  used  to  implement  the  virtual  password  concept 
by  trading  security  for  complexity  by  requiring  a  small 
amount  of  human  computing.  We  further  propose  several 
functions  to  serve  as  system  recommended  functions  and 
provide  a  security  analysis.  We  analyze  how  the  proposed 
schemes  defend  against  phishing,  key  logger,  shoulder-
surfing,  and  multiple  attacks.  In  user-specified  functions,  we 
adopt secret little functions in which security is enhanced by 
hiding  secret  functions/algorithms.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  our  virtual  password  mechanism  is  the  first  one 
which is able to defend against all three attacks. The proposed 
functions  include  secret  little  functions  and  two  other 
schemes called codebook and reference switching functions.  

    Our  objective  is  to  produce  a  function  achieving  both:  1) 
ease  of  computation;  and  2)  security.  However,  since 
simplicity and security conflict, it is difficult to achieve both. 
The  idea  of  this  paper  is  to  add  some  complexity,  through 
user  computations  performed  by  heart/hand  or  computation 
devices,  to  prevent  the  three  kinds  of  attacks.  There  is  a 
tradeoff of how complex the computation by the users can be. 
One goal is to find an easy to compute but secure scheme for 
computing.  To  communicate  with  modules  we  need  a 
powerful  and  fast  processing  micro  controller,  for  this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller. For this SMS purpose we are using SIM900 GSM 
modem,  which  supports  Quad-Band  850/  900/  1800/  1900 
MHz  frequencies  and  the  data  format  is  UART  with  default

baud  rate  is  9600  bps  ,and  it  is  operated  through  AT 
commands.  

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

    In  this  section  some  related  works  are  discussed  below. 
The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  increase  the  security  that 
customer use the ATM machine. Once user's bank card is lost 
and the password is stolen, the criminal will draw all cash in 
the shortest time, which will bring enormous financial losses 
to  customer,  so  to  rectify  this  problem  we  are  implementing 
this  project.  The  chip  of  LPC2148  is  used  for  the  core  of 
microprocessor  in  ARM7.  An  automated  teller  machine 
(ATM) or cash machine is an electronic device that allows a 
bank’s  customers  to  make  cash  withdrawals  and  check  their 
account  balances  without  the  need  or  human  teller.  Many 
ATMs also allow people to deposit cash or cheques, transfer 
money  between  their  bank  ac-  counts,  top  up  their  mobile 
phones prepaid or even buy post- age stamps. In most modern 
ATMs,  the  customer  identifies  him  or  herself  by  inserting  a 
plastic  card  with  magnetic  strip  or  plastic  smart  card  with  a 
chip  that  contains  his  or  her  account  number.  The  customer 
then verifies his or her identity by entering a pass code (i.e.) 
personal  identification  number  (PIN)  of  four  digits.  If  the 
number  is  entered  incorrectly  several  times  consecutively 
(usually three), most ATMs will retain the card as a security 
precaution  to  prevent  an  unauthorized  user  form  discovering 
the PIN by guesswork and so on.  

   Moreover  there  is  a  limitation  in  transaction  for  the  other 
bank  customers  in  using  the  ATM  of  some  other  bank 
crossing  the  limit  they  have  to  pay  transaction  fees.  In  [9], 
one  more  approach  using  GSM  technology  to  communicate 
with the remote devices via SMS is remote  metering system, 
in  this  paper  illustrates  a  technique  for  remotely  reading 
electricity  meter  readings  using  SMS.  Both  postpaid  and 
prepaid  are  feasible  to  implement  using  this  architecture  as 
SMS  based  data  gathering  can  be  done  very  quickly  and 
efficiently.  In  [10]  [11],  this  paper  projected  a  Zigbee-GSM 
based  Monitoring  and  Remote  Control  System.  In  this 
systems  used  both  Zigbee  and  GSM  for  communicating 
between user and devices. This system allows user to monitor 
and  control  devices  in  the  home  through  a  number  of 
controls, including a Zigbee based remote control. Users may 
remotely monitor and control their home devices using GSM. 
In [12], the most important objective of the paper is to design 
and develop a highly developed vehicle locking system in the 
real  time  situation.  The  design  &  development  of  a  theft 
control  system  for  an  automobile,  which  is  being  used  to 
prevent/control the theft of a vehicle.  

    This  system  consists  of  an  embedded  system  and  Global 
System  Mobile  communication  (GSM)  technology.  This 
system  developed  by  Pravada  P.  Wan  hade  and  Prof.  S.O. 
Dahad,  the  developed  system  is  installed  in  the  vehicle.  The 
mobile  is  connected  to  the  microcontroller,  which  is  in  turn, 
connected to the engine. Once, the vehicle is being stolen, the 
information  is  being  used  by  the  vehicle  owner  for  further 
processing.  The  information  is  passed  onto  the  central 
processing insurance system which is in the form of the SMS, 
the  microcontroller  unit  reads  the  SMS  and  sends  it  to  the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) module and says to lock it 
or  to  stop  the  engine  immediately.  The  main  concept  of  this 

paper  vehicle  is  controlled  by  GSM  and  GPS.  The  designed 
unit  is  reliable  and  efficient  system  for  providing  security  to 
the vehicles through GSM, GPS and serial communication. In 
this  project  we  proposed  the  RFID  based  GSM  security 
system  can  be  implemented  easily  for  secure  the  ATM 
machine.  In  this  system  the  working  of  these  ATM  machine 
is  when  the  customer  place  on  the  RFID  module  when  it 
access the ATM for draw the cash then, the machine wants to 
RFID  of  that  user’s  which  use  the  machine.  Using  one  time 
password,  it  verify/identify  ID  and  gives  accurate  result  that 
if  it  valid  or  not  valid.  In  this  way  we  can  try  to  control  the 
crime circle of ATM and do secure it.

password  via  Bluetooth  communication  to  micro  controller, 
then  it  checks  second  level  using  GSM  technology.,  then 
controller  sends  one  time  password  to  pre  register  mobile

2.  Working  Procedure:  Though  we  have  some  security 
systems  at  present,  none  of  them  are  providing  complete 
solution  to  avoid  theft  or  not  restricting  unauthorized  entry 
completely.  Now  a  day’s  so  many  useful  technologies  are 
coming  out  to  make  our  life  style  more  comfort,  luxurious 
and  secure,  with  these  latest  advanced  technologies  we  are 
providing  sophisticated  security  systems.  To  communicate 
with  modules  we  need  a  powerful  and  fast  processing  micro 
controller,  for  this  purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based 
LPC2148  32  bit  micro  controller.  In  this  system,  Bluetooth 
technology  is  used  in  level1  security  layer,  it  asks  mobile 
password which should be entered from android mobile, send 
virtual  password  via  Bluetooth  communication  to  micro

level  using  GSM 
technology.,  then  controller  sends  one  time  password  to  pre 
register mobile number as shown in Fig.2. If the user has that 
mobile  with  him  then  only  he  can  see  that  password  and 
allowed  to  next  level  of  security.  For  this  SMS  purpose  we 
are using SIM900 GSM  modem,  which supports Quad-Band 
850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 MHz frequencies and the data format is 
UART  with default baud rate is 9600 bps ,and it is operated 
through  AT  commands.  After  getting  password  to  GSM 
mobile user has to enter password using keypad, if password 
matched  then  only  user  can  access  the  system.  So  that 
authorized persons only access the system, so that high level 
security  was  provided.  The  coding  was  written  in  embedded 
C  language  and  compile  using  keil  compiler.  The  relevant 
hex  file  was  dumped  into  the  microcontroller  using  FLASH 
MAGIC software.

B. Modules Used In Proposed System 
1. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for 
exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength 
UHF  radio  waves  in  the  ISM  band  from  2.4  to  2.485 GHz) 
from  fixed  and  mobile  devices  and  building  personal  area 
networks  (PANs).  Invented  by  telecom  vendor  Ericsson  in 
1994, it  was originally conceived as a  wireless alternative to 
RS-232  data  cables.  It  can  connect  several  devices, 
overcoming  problems  of  synchronization.  It  gets  its  name 
from a Scandinavian king that united the Danes; because it is 
meant to unify communication protocols over short range into 

a  single  protocol.  Bluetooth  technology  features  low  power 
consumption,  low  cost,  and  security.  It  operates  in  the  ISM 
(Industrial Scientific Medical) Band of 2.4-2.83 GHz. 

2.  GSM  Modem:  Communication  among  vehicle,  Owner, 
police  and  emergency  is  established  accordingly  as  per 
requirement  through  GSM  (Global  Service  for  Mobile 
communication).  A  GSM  modem  is  a  specialized  type  of 
modem  which  accepts  a  SIM  card,  and  operates  over  a 
subscription  to  a  mobile  operator,  just  like  a  mobile  phone. 
From  the  mobile  operator  perspective,  a  GSM  modem  looks 
just like a mobile phone. A GSM modem can be a dedicated 
modem device with a serial, USB or Bluetooth connection or 
it  may  be  a  mobile  phone  that  provides  GSM  modem 
capabilities.  A  GSM  modem  could  also  be  a  standard  GSM 
mobile  phone  the  appropriate  cable  and  software  driver  to 
connect to a serial port or USB port on our computer.

Abstract:  Now  a  day’s  so  many  useful  technologies  are 
coming  out  to  make  our  life  style  more  comfort,  luxurious 
and  secure,  with  these  latest  advanced  technologies  we  are 
providing  sophisticated  security  systems.  The  main  aim  of 
this project is to provide high security to the ATMs with the 
help of advance technologies like android Application, GSM 
and Bluetooth technology. To communicate with modules we 
need a powerful and fast processing micro controller, for this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller.  In  this  system,  Bluetooth  technology  is  used  in 
level1  security  layer,  it  asks  mobile  password  which  should 
be  entered  from  android  mobile,  send  virtual  password  via 
Bluetooth  communication  to  micro  controller,  then  it  checks 
second  level  using  GSM  technology,  then  controller  sends 
one time password to pre register mobile number. If the user 
has that mobile with him then only he can see  that password 
and  allowed  to  next  level  of  security  by  entering  it  using 
keypad and status will be displayed in LCD. 

Keywords:  GSM  and  Bluetooth  Technology,  ARM7, 
Keypad and LCD. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

      A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is 
a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic 
access to his or her bank account(s) at a financial institution. 
The card, where accepted, can be used instead of cash  when 
making  purchases.  Debit  cards  usually  also  allow  for  instant 
withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card for withdrawing 
cash.  Merchants  may  also  offer  cash  back  facilities  to 
customers,  where  a  customer  can  withdraw  cash  along  with 
their  purchase.  A  personal  identification  number  (PIN, 
pronounced  "pin")  is  a  numeric  password  shared  between  a 
user and a system that can be used to authenticate the user to 
the  system.  Typically,  the  user  is  required  to  provide  a  non-
confidential  user  identifier  or  token  (the  user  ID)  and  a 
confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving 
the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon 
the  user  ID  and  compares  the  looked-up  PIN  with  the 
received  PIN.  The  user  is  granted  access  only  when  the 
number  entered  matches  with  the  number  stored  in  the 
system.  Hence,  despite  the  name,  a  PIN  does  not  personally 
identify  the  user.  In  this  project,  we  present  a  password 

protection  scheme  that  involves  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing  in  an  Internet-based  environment  or  a  ATM 
machine,  which  will  be  resistant  to  phishing  scams,  Trojan 
horses,  and  shoulder  surfing  attacks.  We  propose  a  virtual 
password  concept  involving  a  small  amount  of  human 
computing 
in  online 
to 
environments.  

secure  users’  passwords 

    We propose differentiated security mechanisms in which a 
user  has  the  freedom  to  choose  a  virtual  password  scheme 
ranging from weak security to strong security. The tradeoff is 
that  stronger  schemes  are  more  complex.  Among  the 
schemes, we have a default method (i.e., traditional password 
scheme),  a  system  recommended  function,  a  user-specified 
function,  a  user-specified  program,  and  so  on.  A  function/ 
program  is  used  to  implement  the  virtual  password  concept 
by  trading  security  for  complexity  by  requiring  a  small 
amount  of  human  computing.  We  further  propose  several 
functions  to  serve  as  system  recommended  functions  and 
provide  a  security  analysis.  We  analyze  how  the  proposed 
schemes  defend  against  phishing,  key  logger,  shoulder-
surfing,  and  multiple  attacks.  In  user-specified  functions,  we 
adopt secret little functions in which security is enhanced by 
hiding  secret  functions/algorithms.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  our  virtual  password  mechanism  is  the  first  one 
which is able to defend against all three attacks. The proposed 
functions  include  secret  little  functions  and  two  other 
schemes called codebook and reference switching functions.  

    Our  objective  is  to  produce  a  function  achieving  both:  1) 
ease  of  computation;  and  2)  security.  However,  since 
simplicity and security conflict, it is difficult to achieve both. 
The  idea  of  this  paper  is  to  add  some  complexity,  through 
user  computations  performed  by  heart/hand  or  computation 
devices,  to  prevent  the  three  kinds  of  attacks.  There  is  a 
tradeoff of how complex the computation by the users can be. 
One goal is to find an easy to compute but secure scheme for 
computing.  To  communicate  with  modules  we  need  a 
powerful  and  fast  processing  micro  controller,  for  this 
purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based  LPC2148  32  bit  micro 
controller. For this SMS purpose we are using SIM900 GSM 
modem,  which  supports  Quad-Band  850/  900/  1800/  1900 
MHz  frequencies  and  the  data  format  is  UART  with  default

baud  rate  is  9600  bps  ,and  it  is  operated  through  AT 
commands.  

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

    In  this  section  some  related  works  are  discussed  below. 
The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  increase  the  security  that 
customer use the ATM machine. Once user's bank card is lost 
and the password is stolen, the criminal will draw all cash in 
the shortest time, which will bring enormous financial losses 
to  customer,  so  to  rectify  this  problem  we  are  implementing 
this  project.  The  chip  of  LPC2148  is  used  for  the  core  of 
microprocessor  in  ARM7.  An  automated  teller  machine 
(ATM) or cash machine is an electronic device that allows a 
bank’s  customers  to  make  cash  withdrawals  and  check  their 
account  balances  without  the  need  or  human  teller.  Many 
ATMs also allow people to deposit cash or cheques, transfer 
money  between  their  bank  ac-  counts,  top  up  their  mobile 
phones prepaid or even buy post- age stamps. In most modern 
ATMs,  the  customer  identifies  him  or  herself  by  inserting  a 
plastic  card  with  magnetic  strip  or  plastic  smart  card  with  a 
chip  that  contains  his  or  her  account  number.  The  customer 
then verifies his or her identity by entering a pass code (i.e.) 
personal  identification  number  (PIN)  of  four  digits.  If  the 
number  is  entered  incorrectly  several  times  consecutively 
(usually three), most ATMs will retain the card as a security 
precaution  to  prevent  an  unauthorized  user  form  discovering 
the PIN by guesswork and so on.  

   Moreover  there  is  a  limitation  in  transaction  for  the  other 
bank  customers  in  using  the  ATM  of  some  other  bank 
crossing  the  limit  they  have  to  pay  transaction  fees.  In  [9], 
one  more  approach  using  GSM  technology  to  communicate 
with the remote devices via SMS is remote  metering system, 
in  this  paper  illustrates  a  technique  for  remotely  reading 
electricity  meter  readings  using  SMS.  Both  postpaid  and 
prepaid  are  feasible  to  implement  using  this  architecture  as 
SMS  based  data  gathering  can  be  done  very  quickly  and 
efficiently.  In  [10]  [11],  this  paper  projected  a  Zigbee-GSM 
based  Monitoring  and  Remote  Control  System.  In  this 
systems  used  both  Zigbee  and  GSM  for  communicating 
between user and devices. This system allows user to monitor 
and  control  devices  in  the  home  through  a  number  of 
controls, including a Zigbee based remote control. Users may 
remotely monitor and control their home devices using GSM. 
In [12], the most important objective of the paper is to design 
and develop a highly developed vehicle locking system in the 
real  time  situation.  The  design  &  development  of  a  theft 
control  system  for  an  automobile,  which  is  being  used  to 
prevent/control the theft of a vehicle.  

    This  system  consists  of  an  embedded  system  and  Global 
System  Mobile  communication  (GSM)  technology.  This 
system  developed  by  Pravada  P.  Wan  hade  and  Prof.  S.O. 
Dahad,  the  developed  system  is  installed  in  the  vehicle.  The 
mobile  is  connected  to  the  microcontroller,  which  is  in  turn, 
connected to the engine. Once, the vehicle is being stolen, the 
information  is  being  used  by  the  vehicle  owner  for  further 
processing.  The  information  is  passed  onto  the  central 
processing insurance system which is in the form of the SMS, 
the  microcontroller  unit  reads  the  SMS  and  sends  it  to  the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) module and says to lock it 
or  to  stop  the  engine  immediately.  The  main  concept  of  this 

paper  vehicle  is  controlled  by  GSM  and  GPS.  The  designed 
unit  is  reliable  and  efficient  system  for  providing  security  to 
the vehicles through GSM, GPS and serial communication. In 
this  project  we  proposed  the  RFID  based  GSM  security 
system  can  be  implemented  easily  for  secure  the  ATM 
machine.  In  this  system  the  working  of  these  ATM  machine 
is  when  the  customer  place  on  the  RFID  module  when  it 
access the ATM for draw the cash then, the machine wants to 
RFID  of  that  user’s  which  use  the  machine.  Using  one  time 
password,  it  verify/identify  ID  and  gives  accurate  result  that 
if  it  valid  or  not  valid.  In  this  way  we  can  try  to  control  the 
crime circle of ATM and do secure it.

2.  Working  Procedure:  Though  we  have  some  security 
systems  at  present,  none  of  them  are  providing  complete 
solution  to  avoid  theft  or  not  restricting  unauthorized  entry 
completely.  Now  a  day’s  so  many  useful  technologies  are 
coming  out  to  make  our  life  style  more  comfort,  luxurious 
and  secure,  with  these  latest  advanced  technologies  we  are 
providing  sophisticated  security  systems.  To  communicate 
with  modules  we  need  a  powerful  and  fast  processing  micro 
controller,  for  this  purpose  we  are  using  ARM7  based 
LPC2148  32  bit  micro  controller.  In  this  system,  Bluetooth 
technology  is  used  in  level1  security  layer,  it  asks  mobile 
password which should be entered from android mobile, send

level  using  GSM 
technology.,  then  controller  sends  one  time  password  to  pre 
register mobile number as shown in Fig.2. If the user has that 
mobile  with  him  then  only  he  can  see  that  password  and 
allowed  to  next  level  of  security.  For  this  SMS  purpose  we 
are using SIM900 GSM  modem,  which supports Quad-Band 
850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 MHz frequencies and the data format is 
UART  with default baud rate is 9600 bps ,and it is operated 
through  AT  commands.  After  getting  password  to  GSM 
mobile user has to enter password using keypad, if password 
matched  then  only  user  can  access  the  system.  So  that 
authorized persons only access the system, so that high level 
security  was  provided.  The  coding  was  written  in  embedded 
C  language  and  compile  using  keil  compiler.  The  relevant 
hex  file  was  dumped  into  the  microcontroller  using  FLASH 
MAGIC software.

B. Modules Used In Proposed System 
1. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for 
exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength 
UHF  radio  waves  in  the  ISM  band  from  2.4  to  2.485 GHz) 
from  fixed  and  mobile  devices  and  building  personal  area 
networks  (PANs).  Invented  by  telecom  vendor  Ericsson  in 
1994, it  was originally conceived as a  wireless alternative to 
RS-232  data  cables.  It  can  connect  several  devices, 
overcoming  problems  of  synchronization.  It  gets  its  name 
from a Scandinavian king that united the Danes; because it is 
meant to unify communication protocols over short range into 

a  single  protocol.  Bluetooth  technology  features  low  power 
consumption,  low  cost,  and  security.  It  operates  in  the  ISM 
(Industrial Scientific Medical) Band of 2.4-2.83 GHz. 

2.  GSM  Modem:  Communication  among  vehicle,  Owner, 
police  and  emergency  is  established  accordingly  as  per 
requirement  through  GSM  (Global  Service  for  Mobile 
communication).  A  GSM  modem  is  a  specialized  type  of 
modem  which  accepts  a  SIM  card,  and  operates  over  a 
subscription  to  a  mobile  operator,  just  like  a  mobile  phone. 
From  the  mobile  operator  perspective,  a  GSM  modem  looks 
just like a mobile phone. A GSM modem can be a dedicated 
modem device with a serial, USB or Bluetooth connection or 
it  may  be  a  mobile  phone  that  provides  GSM  modem 
capabilities.  A  GSM  modem  could  also  be  a  standard  GSM 
mobile  phone  the  appropriate  cable  and  software  driver  to 
connect to a serial port or USB port on our computer.

the 
microcontroller so that it can control the operation of the IC’s 
used  in  the  implementation.  In  the  present  work,  we  have 
used  the  Orcad  design  software  for  PCB  circuit  design,  the 
Keil µv4 software development tool to write and compile the 
source  code,  which  has  been  written  in  the  C  language.  The 
Flash magic programmer has been used to write this compile 
code into the microcontroller.  
Software Tools Required: 

  Orcad 
  Keil  µVision4 
  Flash Magic 

   Orcad  is  used  for  drawing  the  schematic  diagram,  it  is 
mentioned  above.  Keilµv4,  Flashmagic  are  the  two  software 
tools  used  to  program  microcontroller.  The  working  of  each 
software tool is explained below in detail. 

1.  Programming  Code  Description:  A  compiler  for  a  high 
level  language  helps  to  reduce  production  time.  To  program 
the  LPC2148  microcontroller  the  Keil  µv4  is  used.  The 
programming  is  done  in  the  embedded  C  language  or 
Assembly  language.  Keil  µv4  is  a  suite  of  executable,  open 
source  software  development  tools  for  the  microcontrollers 
hosted  on  the  Windows  platform.  One  of  the  difficulties  of 
programming  microcontrollers  is  the  limited  amount  of 
resources  the  programmer  has  to  deal  with.  In  personal 
computers  resources  such  as  RAM  and  processing  speed  are 
basically  limitless  when  compared  to  microcontrollers.  In 
contrast,  the  code  on  microcontrollers  should  be  as  low  on 
resources as possible. 

2. Keil Compiler:  Keil compiler is  software used  where the 
machine  language  code  is  written  and  compiled.  After 
compilation,  the  machine  source  code  is  converted  into  hex 
code  which  is  to  be  dumped  into  the  microcontroller  for 
further  processing.  Keil  compiler  also  supports  C  language 
code.  The  compilation  of  the  C  program  converts  it  into 
machine  language  file  (.hex).  This  is  the  only  language  the 
microcontroller  will  understand,  because  it  contains  the

original  program  code  converted  into  a  hexadecimal  format. 
During  this  step  there  are  some  warnings  about  eventual 
errors in the program. If there are no errors and warnings then 
run  the  program,  the  system  performs  all  the  required  tasks 
and  behaves  as  expected  the  software  developed.  If  not,  the 
whole procedure will have to be repeated again. Below figs.3 
and 4 show the compilation of the program.

“Design and Development of Advanced  Security  System”  is 
done  successfully.  The  communication  is  properly  done 
without  any  interference  between  different  modules  in  the 
design.  Design  is  done  to  meet  all  the  specifications  and 
requirements.  Software  tools  like  keil  uvision4  simulator, 
flash magic to dump the source code into the microcontroller, 
orcad  lite  for  the  schematic  diagram  have  been  used  to 
develop the software code before realizing the hardware.
