Secure  Localization:  Wireless  sensor  network  use
location based information for identifying the position of
nodes in the network. Few attacks are related with sensor
location  by  investigating  for  attacks.  The  attackers  are
searching the header of packet and data for this purpose.
The secure  localization  is  an  important  factor  during
implementing security in the network.

Confidentiality:  The  confidentiality  is  restricted  data
access to authorized personnel. The data should not leak
across  adjacent  sensor  network.  When  one  node  sends
the highly sensitive data to the destination, it passes from
many nodes in the network. For the provision of security
in data, network protocols are using encryption technique
with a secret key, the message is sent in encrypted for to
the channel. Information should encrypt to protect from
traffic analysis attack [6]. 

Authenticity:   Authenticity   is   imperative   in  WSN,
because   an   adversary   can   easily   inject   messages.
The receiver node need to guarantee that data used in any
decision  making  process  originate  with  trusted  source.
The  data  authenticity  is  to  ensure  of  identities  of

Flexibility:  The  sensor  network  scenarios  are  different
and depending on environmental conditions, hazards and
mission   because   they   are   changing   frequently   [5].
The  changing  mission  goals  frequently  need  sensors  to
be reduced from settle nodes in the network.

Physical Attacks: A wireless sensor network is designed
in  layers  form  and  these  layers  protect  the  sensor  with
various  attacks  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  sensor
networks  are  power  constraint  with  a 
limited
computational  power,  because  of  these  characteristics
exposed the network for attackers. The physical attacks
based  on  different  strategies  and  effects.  Below  we
discuss physical attacks in detail.

Signal  Jamming  Attack:  The  signal  or  radio  jamming
attack is  transmit  the  radio  signals  emitted  by  the
receiving  antenna  at  the  same  transmitter.  The  attack
techniques are constant, deceptive, random and reactive
jamming  in  this  attack.  These  attacks  effects  on  radio
interference and resource exhaustion. The attack is based
on modification class and always the availability integrity
is a main threat  for WSN  in this attack. It  is belong  to
external  and  active  threat  model.  The  detection  of  this
attack possible through detecting background  noise  and

the  main
characteristic  of  any  system  and  traditional  wireless
sensor  network  affected  with  many  types  of  attacks.
The security  attacks  concern  for  WSN  because  of
physical  accessibility  of  sensor  and  actuator  devices  in
network  and  usage  of  minimal  capacity  in  a  network.
These  weaknesses  or  security  attacks  still  present  in
WSN  and   can  be   handled   using    various   security
architectures  and  security  services  like  integrity  and
authenticity, confidentiality in the wireless domain [3]. 

Security Issues in WSN
Availability: The availability in wireless sensor network
ensures  the  network  services  are  feasible  even  in  the
subsistence  of  denial  of  service  attacks.  The  securities
protocols perform the availability of data in the network
with fixate low energy and storage with reuse of code in
network [4]. In availability, a few approaches choose to
adjust the  code  to  reuse  as  much  code  as  possible  and
make  use  of  extra  communication  to  achieve  the  same
goal.

Self Organization:  The  wireless  sensor  network  has
many  nodes  for  operations  and  deployed  in  different
locations  and  fields.  In  self-organization,  the  nodes  are
flexible to be self-organizing and self-healing in network.
The  WSN  is  an  Ad  hoc  network  and  all  nodes  are
independent   in    network   and  without  infrastructure.
This intrinsic characteristic brings a great challenge for
wireless network and security, as well.

Time  Synchronization:  The  wireless  sensor  network
applications  rely  on   some   type   of   synchronization.
The nodes have two states in the network on and sleep
and radio may be turn on or in sleep mode for period of
time.  The  sensor  calculates  the  end-to-end  delay  of a
packet [5].

sends a large  number  of  packets   to  the  base  station.
The  effects  of  this  physical  attack  are  disturbing  the
network  availability   and   node   batteries   exhaustion.
The path based DOS attack is belonged to modification
and fabrication class and availability and authenticity are
main threats for WSN network. In below Figure 2 shows
the nodes affected by path based DOS attack. Initially the
nodes along the path will rapidly become exhausted and
after this the second nodes downstream from nodes along
the  main  path  and  unable  to  communicate  with  base
station.  This  is  because  of  tree-structured  topology  and
in last; the path based DOS attacks can disable a much
wider region than simply a single path.

Node Outage Attack: The node outage attack is stopping
the  functionality  of  WSN  components  and  the  attacks
apply  physically or logically in network. The effects  of
this  attack  are  stopping  the  node  services  such  as
reading,     gathering     and    launching    the   functions.
The attack is belong to modification model and availability
and  authenticities  are  main  threats  for  this  attack  in
network.

Eavesdropping Attack: The eavesdropping is a detection
of contents of communication by overhearing attempt to
data   and apply  through  WSN  transmission  medium.
The   eavesdropping   is  also  called  confidentiality  and
lead   to wormhole  or  blackhole  attacks in network [9].
The effects  of  this  attack  are  extracting  sensitive  WSN
information and delete the privacy and confidentiality of
nodes.  The  attack  is  belongs  to  intersection  model  and
confidentiality is a main threat in network for this attack
and based on external and passive threat models. 

DOS (Denial of Services) Attack: The DOS attack is a
general  attack  and  applies  on  layers  such  as  data  link
layer, network layer and transport layer etc. In this attack,
the  attacker  can  inject  fake  broadcast  packets  to  force
sensor node to perform expensive signature verification.
The DOS attack effects the layers and their functions in
network. The DOS attack is belongs to interruption and
intersection security class and availability, integrity and
authenticity are main threats for this attack [10]. 

CONCLUSION

Provision of security in network is a vital requirement
for  sufficient  and  stable  network  in  communication
technologies. It is a complex feature to deploy in wireless
sensor network because  due  to  the  nature  of  network.
The  most  physical  security  attacks  disturb  the  WSN

Overview of  WSN:  The  WSN  is  based  on  the  dense
deployment     of    disposable    low   energy,   low   cost
tiny   nodes
for   gathering   real   time   information.
Common   functions    of    WSN    are   broadcasting,
multicasting and   routing.  These  nodes   consist of
three    major    components    sensing,    processing    and
communication. Various types of sensor network play a
significant role in the different field. In terrestrial wireless
sensor network nodes  are  dispersed  and  randomly or
pre-planned     manner    placed    into    the   target   area.
The   battery   power  is   limited   in   these   networks.
Another  type  is  underground  WSNs,  in  this  type  the
nodes  are  buried  underground  like  cave  or  mine  for
monitoring  the  conditions.  The  nodes  are  expensive  in
this  type  compare  to  terrestrial  type.  The  multimedia
sensor  network  has  low  cost  nodes  and  equipped  with
microphones  and  cameras.  This  type  of  network  needs
more bandwidth and high energy and quality of service
for processing the data. The underwater sensor networks
are located underwater for gathering the data and network
nature  is  sparse.  The  signal  fading,  delay  and  long
propagation are main issues in this networks [1]. 

The wireless sensor network were primarily proposed
in  domains  where  wired  networks  are  not  suitable  and
infrastructure missing. The hundred and thousand nodes
are  needed  to  achieve  the  assigned  task  such  as  are
military applications, shown in Figure 1.

Secure  Localization:  Wireless  sensor  network  use
location based information for identifying the position of
nodes in the network. Few attacks are related with sensor
location  by  investigating  for  attacks.  The  attackers  are
searching the header of packet and data for this purpose.
The secure  localization  is  an  important  factor  during
implementing security in the network.

Confidentiality:  The  confidentiality  is  restricted  data
access to authorized personnel. The data should not leak
across  adjacent  sensor  network.  When  one  node  sends
the highly sensitive data to the destination, it passes from
many nodes in the network. For the provision of security
in data, network protocols are using encryption technique
with a secret key, the message is sent in encrypted for to
the channel. Information should encrypt to protect from
traffic analysis attack [6]. 

Authenticity:   Authenticity   is   imperative   in  WSN,
because   an   adversary   can   easily   inject   messages.
The receiver node need to guarantee that data used in any
decision  making  process  originate  with  trusted  source.
The  data  authenticity  is  to  ensure  of  identities  of
communication  nodes.

Flexibility:  The  sensor  network  scenarios  are  different
and depending on environmental conditions, hazards and
mission   because   they   are   changing   frequently   [5].
The  changing  mission  goals  frequently  need  sensors  to
be reduced from settle nodes in the network.

Physical Attacks: A wireless sensor network is designed
in  layers  form  and  these  layers  protect  the  sensor  with
various  attacks  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  sensor
networks  are  power  constraint  with  a 
limited
computational  power,  because  of  these  characteristics
exposed the network for attackers. The physical attacks
based  on  different  strategies  and  effects.  Below  we
discuss physical attacks in detail.

Signal  Jamming  Attack:  The  signal  or  radio  jamming
attack is  transmit  the  radio  signals  emitted  by  the
receiving  antenna  at  the  same  transmitter.  The  attack
techniques are constant, deceptive, random and reactive
jamming  in  this  attack.  These  attacks  effects  on  radio
interference and resource exhaustion. The attack is based
on modification class and always the availability integrity
is a main threat  for WSN  in this attack. It  is belong  to
external  and  active  threat  model.  The  detection  of  this
attack possible through detecting background  noise  and

Security 
the  main
characteristic  of  any  system  and  traditional  wireless
sensor  network  affected  with  many  types  of  attacks.
The security  attacks  concern  for  WSN  because  of
physical  accessibility  of  sensor  and  actuator  devices  in
network  and  usage  of  minimal  capacity  in  a  network.
These  weaknesses  or  security  attacks  still  present  in
WSN  and   can  be   handled   using    various   security
architectures  and  security  services  like  integrity  and
authenticity, confidentiality in the wireless domain [3]. 

Security Issues in WSN
Availability: The availability in wireless sensor network
ensures  the  network  services  are  feasible  even  in  the
subsistence  of  denial  of  service  attacks.  The  securities
protocols perform the availability of data in the network
with fixate low energy and storage with reuse of code in
network [4]. In availability, a few approaches choose to
adjust the  code  to  reuse  as  much  code  as  possible  and
make  use  of  extra  communication  to  achieve  the  same
goal.

Self Organization:  The  wireless  sensor  network  has
many  nodes  for  operations  and  deployed  in  different
locations  and  fields.  In  self-organization,  the  nodes  are
flexible to be self-organizing and self-healing in network.
The  WSN  is  an  Ad  hoc  network  and  all  nodes  are
independent   in    network   and  without  infrastructure.
This intrinsic characteristic brings a great challenge for
wireless network and security, as well.

Time  Synchronization:  The  wireless  sensor  network
applications  rely  on   some   type   of   synchronization.
The nodes have two states in the network on and sleep
and radio may be turn on or in sleep mode for period of
time.  The  sensor  calculates  the  end-to-end  delay  of a
packet [5].

sends a large  number  of  packets   to  the  base  station.
The  effects  of  this  physical  attack  are  disturbing  the
network  availability   and   node   batteries   exhaustion.
The path based DOS attack is belonged to modification
and fabrication class and availability and authenticity are
main threats for WSN network. In below Figure 2 shows
the nodes affected by path based DOS attack. Initially the
nodes along the path will rapidly become exhausted and
after this the second nodes downstream from nodes along
the  main  path  and  unable  to  communicate  with  base
station.  This  is  because  of  tree-structured  topology  and
in last; the path based DOS attacks can disable a much
wider region than simply a single path.

Node Outage Attack: The node outage attack is stopping
the  functionality  of  WSN  components  and  the  attacks
apply  physically or logically in network. The effects  of
this  attack  are  stopping  the  node  services  such  as
reading,     gathering     and    launching    the   functions.
The attack is belong to modification model and availability
and  authenticities  are  main  threats  for  this  attack  in
network.

Eavesdropping Attack: The eavesdropping is a detection
of contents of communication by overhearing attempt to
data   and apply  through  WSN  transmission  medium.
The   eavesdropping   is  also  called  confidentiality  and
lead   to wormhole  or  blackhole  attacks in network [9].
The effects  of  this  attack  are  extracting  sensitive  WSN
information and delete the privacy and confidentiality of
nodes.  The  attack  is  belongs  to  intersection  model  and
confidentiality is a main threat in network for this attack
and based on external and passive threat models. 

DOS (Denial of Services) Attack: The DOS attack is a
general  attack  and  applies  on  layers  such  as  data  link
layer, network layer and transport layer etc. In this attack,
the  attacker  can  inject  fake  broadcast  packets  to  force
sensor node to perform expensive signature verification.
The DOS attack effects the layers and their functions in
network. The DOS attack is belongs to interruption and
intersection security class and availability, integrity and
authenticity are main threats for this attack [10]. 

CONCLUSION

Provision of security in network is a vital requirement
for  sufficient  and  stable  network  in  communication
technologies. It is a complex feature to deploy in wireless
sensor network because  due  to  the  nature  of  network.
The  most  physical  security  attacks  disturb  the  WSN
security    dimensions    like      confidentiality,     integrity,

Tempering  and  Capturing  Attack:  Another  physical
attack is device-tempering attack on network; the attacker
captured  the  sensor  node  physically  and  replaces  the
node with their malicious node. The effects of this attack
are stopping the services or disturb the network and may
control over the captured node [7]. This attack belongs to
intersection, modification and fabrication security class.
The     availability,     integrity    and   confidentiality   are
the attack threat in this class. The detection of this type
of attack  possible  through  sensor  node  disconnection,
node destruction and notice misbehavior of the node in

precautions in network. Further the physical protection of

the security issues and physical attacks analyzed. We try
to    focus    more   specific   knowledge   for   researchers.
The  approach  is  to  classify  and  compare  the  WSN’s
physical attacks, their properties such as their strategies
and effects  and  finally  their  associated  detection  and
defensive  techniques  against  these  attacks  to  handle
them independently and comprehensively.
