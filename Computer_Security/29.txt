Abstract:  
During the development of the Internet, computer security has become a major concern for different 
industries, businesses and Governments. The organizations use the Internet for electronic commerce, 
advertising,  information  distribution  and  access,  and  other  pursuits,  but  they  are  worried  about  the 
possibility  of  being  "hacked”.  Ethical  Hacking  increases  security  protection.  Public  and  Private 
organizations  migrate  more  of  their  critical  information  through  the  Internet,  criminals  have  more 
opportunity and incentive to gain access to sensitive information through the Web application. Thus 
the  need  of  protecting  the  systems  from  the  nuisance  of  hacking  generated  by  the  hackers  is  to 
promote  the  persons  who  will  punch  back  the  illegal  attacks  on  our  computer  systems.  So,  Ethical 
hacking is an assessment to test and check an information technology environment for possible weak 
links  and  vulnerabilities.  Ethical  hacking  describes  the  process  of  hacking  a  network  with  good 
intentions. This paper describes what ethical hacking is, what it can do, methods & modes of ethical 
hacking,  types  of  ethical  hacking,  different  tools  used  for  ethical  hacking  and  concept  of  system 
security.

INTRODUCTION 
The  vast  growth  of  Internet  has  brought  many  technological  advances  like  electronic  commerce, 
email, easy access to vast stores of reference material etc .In the other side the hackers secretly steal 
the organization’s information  and transmit  it  to the open internet.  These types of  criminal  hackers 
are called black hat hackers. So, to overcome these major issues, another category of hackers came 
into  existence  and  these  hackers  are  termed  as  ethical  hackers  or  white  hat  hackers.  This  paper 
describes and how they go about helping their customers and plug up security holes. Ethical hackers 
perform  the  hacks  as  security  tests  for  their  systems.  This  type  of  hacking  is  always  legal  and 
trustworthy.  In  other  terms  ethical  hacking  is  the  testing  of  resources  for  the  betterment  of 
technology and is focused on securing and protecting IP systems. 

So, in case of computer security, these tiger teams or ethical hackers would employ the same 
tricks  and  techniques  that  hacker  use  but  in  a  legal  manner.  They  would  neither  damage  the  target 
systems  nor  steal  information.  Instead,  they  would  evaluate  the  target  system’s  security  and  report 
back  to  the  owners  with  the  vulnerabilities  they  found  and  instructions  for  how  to  remedy  them. 
Ethical hacking is a way of doing a security assessment. Like all other assessments an ethical hack is 
a random sample and passing an ethical hack doesn’t mean there are no security issues. An ethical 
hack’s results is a detailed report of the findings as well as a  testimony that a hacker with a certain 
amount  of  time  and  skills  is  or  isn’t  able  to  successfully  attack  a  system  or  get  access  to  certain

information. Ethical hacking can be categorized as a security assessment, a kind of training, a test for 
the  security  of  an  information  technology  environment.  An  ethical  hack  shows  the  risks  an 
information technology environment is facing and actions can be taken to reduce certain risks or to 
accept them.  

Fig 1: Security Life Cycle 

 

Morals of an Ethical Hacker: 
1.  Obeying  the  Ethical  Hacking  Commandments:  Every  Ethical  Hacker  must  follow  few  basic 
principles.  Most  of  the  time  these  principles  get  ignored  or  forgotten  while  planning  or  executing 
ethical hacking tests. The test results are even very dangerous. 
2. Working ethically: The word ethical can be defined as working with high professional morals and 
principles.  Whether  you’re  performing  ethical  hacking  tests  against  your  own  systems  or  for 
someone  who  has  hired  you,  everything  you  do  as  an  ethical  Hacker  must  be  approved  and  must 
support the company’s goals. The misuse of information is absolutely not allowed. 
3.  Respecting  privacy:  Ethical  Hacker  must  treat  the  information  with  complete  respect.  The 
passwords pertaining to these information must be kept private. 
4. Not crashing your own systems: One of the biggest mistakes is when people try to hack their own 
systems; they come up with crashing their systems. The main reason for this is poor planning. These 
testers have not read the documentation or misunderstand the usage and power of the security tools 
and techniques. You can easily create miserable conditions on your systems when testing. Running 
too many tests too quickly on a system causes many system lockups. Many security assessment tools 
can control how many tests are performed on a system at the same time. These tools are especially 
handy if you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. 
5. Executing the plan: In Ethical hacking, time and patience are important. One must be very careful 

while performing the ethical hacking tests. 

 
TYPES OF HACKER 
White  Hat  Hackers:  White  hat  hackers  are ethical  hackers with  some  certifications  such  as  CEH 
(Certified Ethical Hacker). They break into systems just for legal purposes. Their main motive is to 
find  loopholes  in  the  networks  and  rectifying  them.  These  type  of  hackers  work  with  famous 
companies in securing their systems and protecting them against other hackers. 
Black Hat Hacker: A black hat hacker may or may not have any hacking certification but they hold 
good  knowledge  about  hacking.  They  use  their  skills  for  destructive  purposes.  They  break  into 
systems and networks either for fun or to gain some money by illegal means. They gain unauthorized 
access and destroy/steal confidential data and cause problems to their target.

Gray Hat Hacker: A grey hat hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A 
Grey  Hat  Hacker  may  surf  the  internet  and  hack  into  a  computer  system  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked. They may offer to repair their system 
for a small fee. 
 
MODE OF ETHICAL HACKING: 
Insider attack: This ethical hack simulates the types of attacks and activities that could be carried out 
by an authorized individual with a legitimate connection to the organization’s network. 
Outsider attack :This ethical hack seeks to simulate the types of attacks that could be launched across 
the  Internet.  It  could target Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol,  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP), 
Structured Query Language, or any other available services. 
Stolen  equipment  attack:  This  simulation  is  closely  related  to  a  physical  attack  as  it  targets  the 
organization’s  equipment.  It  could  seek  to  target  the  CEO’s  laptop  or  the  organization’s  backup 
tapes.  No  matter  what  the  target,  the  goal  is  to  extract  critical  information,  usernames,  and 
passwords. 
Physical  entry:  This  simulation  seeks  to  test  the  organization’s  physical  controls.  Systems  such  as 
doors,  gates,  locks,  guards,  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV),  and  alarms  are  tested  to  see  whether 
they can be bypassed. 
Bypassed  authentication  attack:  This  simulation  is  tasked  with  looking  for  wireless  access  points 
(WAP)  and  modems.  The  goal  is  to  see  whether  these  systems  are  secure  and  offer  sufficient 
authentication controls.  If the controls can be bypassed, the ethical hacker might probe to see what 
level of system control can be obtained. 
Social  engineering  attack:  This  simulation  does  not  target technical  systems or  physical  access. 
Social engineering attacks target the organization’s employees and seek to manipulate them to 
gain  privileged  information.  Proper  controls,  policies,  and  procedures  can  go  a  long  way  in 
defeating this form of attack. 

 
STEPS INVOLVED IN HACKING PROCESS 
 

Fig 2: Process of Hacking 

 

1. Reconnaissance: To be able to attack a system systematically, a hacker has to  know as much as 
possible  about  the  target.  It  is  important  to  get  an  overview  of  the  network  and  the  used  systems. 
Information such as DNS servers, administrator contacts and IP ranges can be collected. During the

information. Ethical hacking can be categorized as a security assessment, a kind of training, a test for 
the  security  of  an  information  technology  environment.  An  ethical  hack  shows  the  risks  an 
information technology environment is facing and actions can be taken to reduce certain risks or to 
accept them.  

Fig 1: Security Life Cycle 

 

Morals of an Ethical Hacker: 
1.  Obeying  the  Ethical  Hacking  Commandments:  Every  Ethical  Hacker  must  follow  few  basic 
principles.  Most  of  the  time  these  principles  get  ignored  or  forgotten  while  planning  or  executing 
ethical hacking tests. The test results are even very dangerous. 
2. Working ethically: The word ethical can be defined as working with high professional morals and 
principles.  Whether  you’re  performing  ethical  hacking  tests  against  your  own  systems  or  for 
someone  who  has  hired  you,  everything  you  do  as  an  ethical  Hacker  must  be  approved  and  must 
support the company’s goals. The misuse of information is absolutely not allowed. 
3.  Respecting  privacy:  Ethical  Hacker  must  treat  the  information  with  complete  respect.  The 
passwords pertaining to these information must be kept private. 
4. Not crashing your own systems: One of the biggest mistakes is when people try to hack their own 
systems; they come up with crashing their systems. The main reason for this is poor planning. These 
testers have not read the documentation or misunderstand the usage and power of the security tools 
and techniques. You can easily create miserable conditions on your systems when testing. Running 
too many tests too quickly on a system causes many system lockups. Many security assessment tools 
can control how many tests are performed on a system at the same time. These tools are especially 
handy if you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. 
5. Executing the plan: In Ethical hacking, time and patience are important. One must be very careful 

while performing the ethical hacking tests. 

 
TYPES OF HACKER 
White  Hat  Hackers:  White  hat  hackers  are ethical  hackers with  some  certifications  such  as  CEH 
(Certified Ethical Hacker). They break into systems just for legal purposes. Their main motive is to 
find  loopholes  in  the  networks  and  rectifying  them.  These  type  of  hackers  work  with  famous 
companies in securing their systems and protecting them against other hackers. 
Black Hat Hacker: A black hat hacker may or may not have any hacking certification but they hold 
good  knowledge  about  hacking.  They  use  their  skills  for  destructive  purposes.  They  break  into 
systems and networks either for fun or to gain some money by illegal means. They gain unauthorized 
access and destroy/steal confidential data and cause problems to their target.

Gray Hat Hacker: A grey hat hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A 
Grey  Hat  Hacker  may  surf  the  internet  and  hack  into  a  computer  system  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked. They may offer to repair their system 
for a small fee. 
 
MODE OF ETHICAL HACKING: 
Insider attack: This ethical hack simulates the types of attacks and activities that could be carried out 
by an authorized individual with a legitimate connection to the organization’s network. 
Outsider attack :This ethical hack seeks to simulate the types of attacks that could be launched across 
the  Internet.  It  could target Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol,  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP), 
Structured Query Language, or any other available services. 
Stolen  equipment  attack:  This  simulation  is  closely  related  to  a  physical  attack  as  it  targets  the 
organization’s  equipment.  It  could  seek  to  target  the  CEO’s  laptop  or  the  organization’s  backup 
tapes.  No  matter  what  the  target,  the  goal  is  to  extract  critical  information,  usernames,  and 
passwords. 
Physical  entry:  This  simulation  seeks  to  test  the  organization’s  physical  controls.  Systems  such  as 
doors,  gates,  locks,  guards,  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV),  and  alarms  are  tested  to  see  whether 
they can be bypassed. 
Bypassed  authentication  attack:  This  simulation  is  tasked  with  looking  for  wireless  access  points 
(WAP)  and  modems.  The  goal  is  to  see  whether  these  systems  are  secure  and  offer  sufficient 
authentication controls.  If the controls can be bypassed, the ethical hacker might probe to see what 
level of system control can be obtained. 
Social  engineering  attack:  This  simulation  does  not  target technical  systems or  physical  access. 
Social engineering attacks target the organization’s employees and seek to manipulate them to 
gain  privileged  information.  Proper  controls,  policies,  and  procedures  can  go  a  long  way  in 
defeating this form of attack. 

 
STEPS INVOLVED IN HACKING PROCESS 
 

Fig 2: Process of Hacking 

 

1. Reconnaissance: To be able to attack a system systematically, a hacker has to  know as much as 
possible  about  the  target.  It  is  important  to  get  an  overview  of  the  network  and  the  used  systems. 
Information such as DNS servers, administrator contacts and IP ranges can be collected. During the

reconnaissance  phase  different  types  of  tools  can  be  used  –  network  mapping,  network  and 
vulnerability  scanning  tools  are  commonly  used.  Cheops  for  example  is  a  very  good  network 
mapping  tool  generates  networking  graphs.  These  maps  gives  an  overview  about  the  network  and 
helps during the attack phase. A network mapping tool is very helpful when doing an internal ethical 
hack. At the end of the reconnaissance phase, an attacker should have a bunch of information about 
the target. With all these pieces of information, a promising attack path can be constructed. 
2.  Probe  and  Attack:  This  is  a  phase  2  process  as  shown  in  the  above  fig.  The  probe  and  attack 
phase  is  about  digging  in,  going  closer  and  getting  a  feeling  for  the  target.  It’s  time  to  try  the 
collected, possible vulnerabilities from the reconnaissance phase. Tools which can be used during the 
Probe and Attack phase are many-sided as web exploits; buffer overflows as well as brute-force can 
be applied. Even Trojans like Net Bus can be deployed to capture keystrokes, get screenshots or start 
applications  and  a  host.  The  probe  and  attack  phase  becomes  very  time  consuming,  especially  if 
brute force attack techniques are used or when individual pieces of software needs to be developed or 
analyzed. 
3.  Listening:  This  is  again  a  phase  2  process  i.e.  scanning  which  is  a  combination  of  Probe  and 
attack and listening. Listening to network traffic or to application data can sometimes help to attack a 
system or to advance deeper into a corporate network. Sniffers are heavily used during the listening 
phase. Sniffers can be simple or complex in nature. It can be console based or GUI driven.  
4. First Access: This is a phase 3 process  which is not about getting root access, it’s about  getting 
any access to a system be it a user or root account. Once this option is available it’s time to go for 
higher access levels or new systems which are reachable through the acquired system. 
5.  Advancement:  Phase  4  i.e.  Maintaining  access  is  a  combination  of  Advancement  and  Stealth 
process.  The  advancement  phase  is  probably  the  most  creative  demanding  stage,  as  unlimited 
possibilities are open. Sniffing network traffic may unveil certain passwords, needed usernames or e-
mail traffic with usable information. Sending mails to administrators faking some known users may 
help in getting desired information or even access to a new system. Last but not least, installing new 
tools and helpful scripts may help to dig in deeper or to scan log files for more details. 
6. Stealth: Some systems may be of high value – systems which act as routers or firewalls, systems 
where a root account could be acquired. To have access to such systems at a later time it is important 
to clean relevant log files. 
7. Takeover: Takeover is a phase 5 process. Once root access could be attained, the system can be 
considered  won.  From  there  on  it’s  possible  to  install  any  tools,  do  every  action  and  start  every 
services on that particular machine. Depending on the machine it can now be possible to misuse trust 
relationships, create new relationships or disable certain security checks. 
8. Cleanup: This could be instructions in the final report on how to remove certain Trojans but most 
of the time this will be done by the hacker itself. Removing all traces as far as possible is kind of a 
duty for the hacking craft. 
An ethical hack always poses a certain risks if not properly done. A hacker could use the deployed 
tools or hide his attacks. He could also try to attack the attackers system, therefore gain entry to the 
ethical hackers system and collect all information free of charge, sorted and prepared. Preparing an 
ethical  hack  and  hold  a  high  level  of  security  is  a  challenging  task  which  should  only  be  done  by 
professionals. 
 
TOOLS USED IN ETHICAL HACKING 
It is very much essential to make sure that we are using the right tool for ethical hacking process. It is 
important to know the personal  as well as technical limitations. Many tools focus on specific tests, 
but no one tool can test for everything. For example, to crack passwords (you need a cracking tools

Abstract:  
During the development of the Internet, computer security has become a major concern for different 
industries, businesses and Governments. The organizations use the Internet for electronic commerce, 
advertising,  information  distribution  and  access,  and  other  pursuits,  but  they  are  worried  about  the 
possibility  of  being  "hacked”.  Ethical  Hacking  increases  security  protection.  Public  and  Private 
organizations  migrate  more  of  their  critical  information  through  the  Internet,  criminals  have  more 
opportunity and incentive to gain access to sensitive information through the Web application. Thus 
the  need  of  protecting  the  systems  from  the  nuisance  of  hacking  generated  by  the  hackers  is  to 
promote  the  persons  who  will  punch  back  the  illegal  attacks  on  our  computer  systems.  So,  Ethical 
hacking is an assessment to test and check an information technology environment for possible weak 
links  and  vulnerabilities.  Ethical  hacking  describes  the  process  of  hacking  a  network  with  good 
intentions. This paper describes what ethical hacking is, what it can do, methods & modes of ethical 
hacking,  types  of  ethical  hacking,  different  tools  used  for  ethical  hacking  and  concept  of  system 
security.

INTRODUCTION 
The  vast  growth  of  Internet  has  brought  many  technological  advances  like  electronic  commerce, 
email, easy access to vast stores of reference material etc .In the other side the hackers secretly steal 
the organization’s information  and transmit  it  to the open internet.  These types of  criminal  hackers 
are called black hat hackers. So, to overcome these major issues, another category of hackers came 
into  existence  and  these  hackers  are  termed  as  ethical  hackers  or  white  hat  hackers.  This  paper 
describes and how they go about helping their customers and plug up security holes. Ethical hackers 
perform  the  hacks  as  security  tests  for  their  systems.  This  type  of  hacking  is  always  legal  and 
trustworthy.  In  other  terms  ethical  hacking  is  the  testing  of  resources  for  the  betterment  of 
technology and is focused on securing and protecting IP systems. 

So, in case of computer security, these tiger teams or ethical hackers would employ the same 
tricks  and  techniques  that  hacker  use  but  in  a  legal  manner.  They  would  neither  damage  the  target 
systems  nor  steal  information.  Instead,  they  would  evaluate  the  target  system’s  security  and  report 
back  to  the  owners  with  the  vulnerabilities  they  found  and  instructions  for  how  to  remedy  them. 
Ethical hacking is a way of doing a security assessment. Like all other assessments an ethical hack is 
a random sample and passing an ethical hack doesn’t mean there are no security issues. An ethical 
hack’s results is a detailed report of the findings as well as a  testimony that a hacker with a certain 
amount  of  time  and  skills  is  or  isn’t  able  to  successfully  attack  a  system  or  get  access  to  certain

TOOLS USED IN ETHICAL HACKING 
It is very much essential to make sure that we are using the right tool for ethical hacking process. It is 
important to know the personal  as well as technical limitations. Many tools focus on specific tests, 
but no one tool can test for everything. For example, to crack passwords (you need a cracking tools

such as LC4 or John the Ripper are needed. Similarly, for an in-depth analysis of a Web application, 
a Web-application assessment tool is more appropriate than a network analyser (such as Ethereal).  
There are various characteristics for the use of tools for ethical hacking which are as follows: 
1. Adequate documentation 
2. Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they can be fixed 
3. Updates and support when needed 
4. High level reports that can be presented to managers 
These features can save  the time and  effort  when we  are writing  the report. Time and patience are 
important  in  ethical  hacking  process.  One  should  be  careful  when  performing  the  ethical  hacking 
tests. It is not practical to make sure that no hackers are on our system. It is good to keep everything 
private  if  possible.  Do  encrypt  the  emails  and  files  if  possible.  The  list  and  description  of  various 
tools used in the ethical hacking process are as follows: 
 
1. Scanning tools: The Scanning tools are quite helpful in the ethical hacking process. In technical 
detail,  a  scanner  sends  a  message  requesting  to  open  a  connection  with  a  computer  on  a  particular 
port. (A port is an interface where different layers of software exchanges information). The computer 
has various options like - ignoring the message, responding negatively to the message, or opening a 
session.  Ignoring  the  message  is  the  safest  since  if  there  are  no  open  services  it  may  be  hard  for  a 
cracker to determine if a computer exists. Once a port scan reveals the existence of an open service, a 
cracker  can  attack  known  vulnerabilities.  Once  a  cracker  scans  all  computers  on  a  network  and 
creates a network map showing which computers are running on which operating systems and what 
services are available, almost any kind  of attack  is possible including automated scripting program 
attacks  and  social  engineered  attacks.  The  first  scanner  was  the  security  administrator’s  tool  for 
analysing  networks  SATAN  introduced  by  Dan  Farmer  in  1995.  SATAN  (Security  Administrator 
tool for analysing networks) could analyse any system accessible over the internet. But the question 
here is that why should anyone with internet presence and no interest in cracking other systems learn 
about  scanners?  The  answer  is  to  learn  what  crackers  will  see  in  their  own  internet  presence  since 
scanners  are  common  attack  starting  points.  Crackers  look  for  unauthorized  services  such  as 
someone  running  a  server  with  known  problems,  an  unauthorized  server  on  a  high  port  etc.  Port 
scanning  can  be  done  manually  from  a  single  computer  to  learn  about  target  systems  or  it  can  be 
done automatically by program originating from multiple computers on different networks to a single 
target  system  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Port  scanners  like  other  tools,  have  both  offensive  and 
defensive  applications-  what  makes  a  port  scanner  good  or  evil.  Actually,  a  port  scanner  is 
simultaneously  both  the  most  powerful  tool  an  ethical  hacker  can  use  in  protecting  the  network  of 
computers and the most powerful tool a cracker can use to generate attacks.

Abstract:  
During the development of the Internet, computer security has become a major concern for different 
industries, businesses and Governments. The organizations use the Internet for electronic commerce, 
advertising,  information  distribution  and  access,  and  other  pursuits,  but  they  are  worried  about  the 
possibility  of  being  "hacked”.  Ethical  Hacking  increases  security  protection.  Public  and  Private 
organizations  migrate  more  of  their  critical  information  through  the  Internet,  criminals  have  more 
opportunity and incentive to gain access to sensitive information through the Web application. Thus 
the  need  of  protecting  the  systems  from  the  nuisance  of  hacking  generated  by  the  hackers  is  to 
promote  the  persons  who  will  punch  back  the  illegal  attacks  on  our  computer  systems.  So,  Ethical 
hacking is an assessment to test and check an information technology environment for possible weak 
links  and  vulnerabilities.  Ethical  hacking  describes  the  process  of  hacking  a  network  with  good 
intentions. This paper describes what ethical hacking is, what it can do, methods & modes of ethical 
hacking,  types  of  ethical  hacking,  different  tools  used  for  ethical  hacking  and  concept  of  system 
security.

INTRODUCTION 
The  vast  growth  of  Internet  has  brought  many  technological  advances  like  electronic  commerce, 
email, easy access to vast stores of reference material etc .In the other side the hackers secretly steal 
the organization’s information  and transmit  it  to the open internet.  These types of  criminal  hackers 
are called black hat hackers. So, to overcome these major issues, another category of hackers came 
into  existence  and  these  hackers  are  termed  as  ethical  hackers  or  white  hat  hackers.  This  paper 
describes and how they go about helping their customers and plug up security holes. Ethical hackers 
perform  the  hacks  as  security  tests  for  their  systems.  This  type  of  hacking  is  always  legal  and 
trustworthy.  In  other  terms  ethical  hacking  is  the  testing  of  resources  for  the  betterment  of 
technology and is focused on securing and protecting IP systems. 

So, in case of computer security, these tiger teams or ethical hackers would employ the same 
tricks  and  techniques  that  hacker  use  but  in  a  legal  manner.  They  would  neither  damage  the  target 
systems  nor  steal  information.  Instead,  they  would  evaluate  the  target  system’s  security  and  report 
back  to  the  owners  with  the  vulnerabilities  they  found  and  instructions  for  how  to  remedy  them. 
Ethical hacking is a way of doing a security assessment. Like all other assessments an ethical hack is 
a random sample and passing an ethical hack doesn’t mean there are no security issues. An ethical 
hack’s results is a detailed report of the findings as well as a  testimony that a hacker with a certain 
amount  of  time  and  skills  is  or  isn’t  able  to  successfully  attack  a  system  or  get  access  to  certain

information. Ethical hacking can be categorized as a security assessment, a kind of training, a test for 
the  security  of  an  information  technology  environment.  An  ethical  hack  shows  the  risks  an 
information technology environment is facing and actions can be taken to reduce certain risks or to 
accept them.  

Fig 1: Security Life Cycle 

 

Morals of an Ethical Hacker: 
1.  Obeying  the  Ethical  Hacking  Commandments:  Every  Ethical  Hacker  must  follow  few  basic 
principles.  Most  of  the  time  these  principles  get  ignored  or  forgotten  while  planning  or  executing 
ethical hacking tests. The test results are even very dangerous. 
2. Working ethically: The word ethical can be defined as working with high professional morals and 
principles.  Whether  you’re  performing  ethical  hacking  tests  against  your  own  systems  or  for 
someone  who  has  hired  you,  everything  you  do  as  an  ethical  Hacker  must  be  approved  and  must 
support the company’s goals. The misuse of information is absolutely not allowed. 
3.  Respecting  privacy:  Ethical  Hacker  must  treat  the  information  with  complete  respect.  The 
passwords pertaining to these information must be kept private. 
4. Not crashing your own systems: One of the biggest mistakes is when people try to hack their own 
systems; they come up with crashing their systems. The main reason for this is poor planning. These 
testers have not read the documentation or misunderstand the usage and power of the security tools 
and techniques. You can easily create miserable conditions on your systems when testing. Running 
too many tests too quickly on a system causes many system lockups. Many security assessment tools 
can control how many tests are performed on a system at the same time. These tools are especially 
handy if you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. 
5. Executing the plan: In Ethical hacking, time and patience are important. One must be very careful 

while performing the ethical hacking tests. 

 
TYPES OF HACKER 
White  Hat  Hackers:  White  hat  hackers  are ethical  hackers with  some  certifications  such  as  CEH 
(Certified Ethical Hacker). They break into systems just for legal purposes. Their main motive is to 
find  loopholes  in  the  networks  and  rectifying  them.  These  type  of  hackers  work  with  famous 
companies in securing their systems and protecting them against other hackers. 
Black Hat Hacker: A black hat hacker may or may not have any hacking certification but they hold 
good  knowledge  about  hacking.  They  use  their  skills  for  destructive  purposes.  They  break  into 
systems and networks either for fun or to gain some money by illegal means. They gain unauthorized 
access and destroy/steal confidential data and cause problems to their target.

Gray Hat Hacker: A grey hat hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A 
Grey  Hat  Hacker  may  surf  the  internet  and  hack  into  a  computer  system  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked. They may offer to repair their system 
for a small fee. 
 
MODE OF ETHICAL HACKING: 
Insider attack: This ethical hack simulates the types of attacks and activities that could be carried out 
by an authorized individual with a legitimate connection to the organization’s network. 
Outsider attack :This ethical hack seeks to simulate the types of attacks that could be launched across 
the  Internet.  It  could target Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol,  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP), 
Structured Query Language, or any other available services. 
Stolen  equipment  attack:  This  simulation  is  closely  related  to  a  physical  attack  as  it  targets  the 
organization’s  equipment.  It  could  seek  to  target  the  CEO’s  laptop  or  the  organization’s  backup 
tapes.  No  matter  what  the  target,  the  goal  is  to  extract  critical  information,  usernames,  and 
passwords. 
Physical  entry:  This  simulation  seeks  to  test  the  organization’s  physical  controls.  Systems  such  as 
doors,  gates,  locks,  guards,  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV),  and  alarms  are  tested  to  see  whether 
they can be bypassed. 
Bypassed  authentication  attack:  This  simulation  is  tasked  with  looking  for  wireless  access  points 
(WAP)  and  modems.  The  goal  is  to  see  whether  these  systems  are  secure  and  offer  sufficient 
authentication controls.  If the controls can be bypassed, the ethical hacker might probe to see what 
level of system control can be obtained. 
Social  engineering  attack:  This  simulation  does  not  target technical  systems or  physical  access. 
Social engineering attacks target the organization’s employees and seek to manipulate them to 
gain  privileged  information.  Proper  controls,  policies,  and  procedures  can  go  a  long  way  in 
defeating this form of attack. 

 
STEPS INVOLVED IN HACKING PROCESS 
 

Fig 2: Process of Hacking 

 

1. Reconnaissance: To be able to attack a system systematically, a hacker has to  know as much as 
possible  about  the  target.  It  is  important  to  get  an  overview  of  the  network  and  the  used  systems. 
Information such as DNS servers, administrator contacts and IP ranges can be collected. During the

reconnaissance  phase  different  types  of  tools  can  be  used  –  network  mapping,  network  and 
vulnerability  scanning  tools  are  commonly  used.  Cheops  for  example  is  a  very  good  network 
mapping  tool  generates  networking  graphs.  These  maps  gives  an  overview  about  the  network  and 
helps during the attack phase. A network mapping tool is very helpful when doing an internal ethical 
hack. At the end of the reconnaissance phase, an attacker should have a bunch of information about 
the target. With all these pieces of information, a promising attack path can be constructed. 
2.  Probe  and  Attack:  This  is  a  phase  2  process  as  shown  in  the  above  fig.  The  probe  and  attack 
phase  is  about  digging  in,  going  closer  and  getting  a  feeling  for  the  target.  It’s  time  to  try  the 
collected, possible vulnerabilities from the reconnaissance phase. Tools which can be used during the 
Probe and Attack phase are many-sided as web exploits; buffer overflows as well as brute-force can 
be applied. Even Trojans like Net Bus can be deployed to capture keystrokes, get screenshots or start 
applications  and  a  host.  The  probe  and  attack  phase  becomes  very  time  consuming,  especially  if 
brute force attack techniques are used or when individual pieces of software needs to be developed or 
analyzed. 
3.  Listening:  This  is  again  a  phase  2  process  i.e.  scanning  which  is  a  combination  of  Probe  and 
attack and listening. Listening to network traffic or to application data can sometimes help to attack a 
system or to advance deeper into a corporate network. Sniffers are heavily used during the listening 
phase. Sniffers can be simple or complex in nature. It can be console based or GUI driven.  
4. First Access: This is a phase 3 process  which is not about getting root access, it’s about  getting 
any access to a system be it a user or root account. Once this option is available it’s time to go for 
higher access levels or new systems which are reachable through the acquired system. 
5.  Advancement:  Phase  4  i.e.  Maintaining  access  is  a  combination  of  Advancement  and  Stealth 
process.  The  advancement  phase  is  probably  the  most  creative  demanding  stage,  as  unlimited 
possibilities are open. Sniffing network traffic may unveil certain passwords, needed usernames or e-
mail traffic with usable information. Sending mails to administrators faking some known users may 
help in getting desired information or even access to a new system. Last but not least, installing new 
tools and helpful scripts may help to dig in deeper or to scan log files for more details. 
6. Stealth: Some systems may be of high value – systems which act as routers or firewalls, systems 
where a root account could be acquired. To have access to such systems at a later time it is important 
to clean relevant log files. 
7. Takeover: Takeover is a phase 5 process. Once root access could be attained, the system can be 
considered  won.  From  there  on  it’s  possible  to  install  any  tools,  do  every  action  and  start  every 
services on that particular machine. Depending on the machine it can now be possible to misuse trust 
relationships, create new relationships or disable certain security checks. 
8. Cleanup: This could be instructions in the final report on how to remove certain Trojans but most 
of the time this will be done by the hacker itself. Removing all traces as far as possible is kind of a 
duty for the hacking craft. 
An ethical hack always poses a certain risks if not properly done. A hacker could use the deployed 
tools or hide his attacks. He could also try to attack the attackers system, therefore gain entry to the 
ethical hackers system and collect all information free of charge, sorted and prepared. Preparing an 
ethical  hack  and  hold  a  high  level  of  security  is  a  challenging  task  which  should  only  be  done  by 
professionals. 
 
TOOLS USED IN ETHICAL HACKING 
It is very much essential to make sure that we are using the right tool for ethical hacking process. It is 
important to know the personal  as well as technical limitations. Many tools focus on specific tests, 
but no one tool can test for everything. For example, to crack passwords (you need a cracking tools

such as LC4 or John the Ripper are needed. Similarly, for an in-depth analysis of a Web application, 
a Web-application assessment tool is more appropriate than a network analyser (such as Ethereal).  
There are various characteristics for the use of tools for ethical hacking which are as follows: 
1. Adequate documentation 
2. Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they can be fixed 
3. Updates and support when needed 
4. High level reports that can be presented to managers 
These features can save  the time and  effort  when we  are writing  the report. Time and patience are 
important  in  ethical  hacking  process.  One  should  be  careful  when  performing  the  ethical  hacking 
tests. It is not practical to make sure that no hackers are on our system. It is good to keep everything 
private  if  possible.  Do  encrypt  the  emails  and  files  if  possible.  The  list  and  description  of  various 
tools used in the ethical hacking process are as follows: 
 
1. Scanning tools: The Scanning tools are quite helpful in the ethical hacking process. In technical 
detail,  a  scanner  sends  a  message  requesting  to  open  a  connection  with  a  computer  on  a  particular 
port. (A port is an interface where different layers of software exchanges information). The computer 
has various options like - ignoring the message, responding negatively to the message, or opening a 
session.  Ignoring  the  message  is  the  safest  since  if  there  are  no  open  services  it  may  be  hard  for  a 
cracker to determine if a computer exists. Once a port scan reveals the existence of an open service, a 
cracker  can  attack  known  vulnerabilities.  Once  a  cracker  scans  all  computers  on  a  network  and 
creates a network map showing which computers are running on which operating systems and what 
services are available, almost any kind  of attack  is possible including automated scripting program 
attacks  and  social  engineered  attacks.  The  first  scanner  was  the  security  administrator’s  tool  for 
analysing  networks  SATAN  introduced  by  Dan  Farmer  in  1995.  SATAN  (Security  Administrator 
tool for analysing networks) could analyse any system accessible over the internet. But the question 
here is that why should anyone with internet presence and no interest in cracking other systems learn 
about  scanners?  The  answer  is  to  learn  what  crackers  will  see  in  their  own  internet  presence  since 
scanners  are  common  attack  starting  points.  Crackers  look  for  unauthorized  services  such  as 
someone  running  a  server  with  known  problems,  an  unauthorized  server  on  a  high  port  etc.  Port 
scanning  can  be  done  manually  from  a  single  computer  to  learn  about  target  systems  or  it  can  be 
done automatically by program originating from multiple computers on different networks to a single 
target  system  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Port  scanners  like  other  tools,  have  both  offensive  and 
defensive  applications-  what  makes  a  port  scanner  good  or  evil.  Actually,  a  port  scanner  is 
simultaneously  both  the  most  powerful  tool  an  ethical  hacker  can  use  in  protecting  the  network  of 
computers and the most powerful tool a cracker can use to generate attacks.

time and bandwidth before you break into a system. There are three basic types of password cracking 
tests that can be automated with tools: 
Dictionary- A file of words is run against user accounts, and if the password is a simple word, it can 
be found pretty quickly. 
Hybrid: A common method utilized by users to change passwords is to add a number or symbol to 
the end.A hybrid  attack  works like  a dictionary  attack, but  adds simple  numbers or symbols to the 
password attempt. 
Brute  force:  The  most  time  consuming,  but  comprehensive  way  to  crack  a  password.  Every 

combination of character is tried until the password is broken. 

 

 
Brutus 
 

It  is  a  password  cracking  tool  that  can  perform  both  dictionary  attacks  and  brute 
force  attacks  where  passwords  are  randomly  generated  from  a  given  character. 
Brutus  can  crack  the  multiple  authentication  types,  HTTP  (Basic  authentication, 
HTML Form/CGI), POP3, FTP, SMB and Telnet. 

Web 
cracker 

It is a simple tool that takes text lists of usernames and passwords, and uses them as 
dictionaries to implement basic authentication password guessing. 

 
ObiWan 

It  is  a  Web  password  cracking  tool  that  can  work  through  a  proxy.  ObiWan  uses 
wordlists  and  alternations  of  numeric  or  alpha-numeric  characters  as  possible 
passwords. 

Table 2: Web password cracking tool 

3. Port Scanning tools: Port scanning is one of the most common reconnaissance techniques used by 
testers  to  discover  the  vulnerabilities  in  the  services  listening  at  well-known  ports.  Once  you've 
identified the IP address of a target system through foot printing, you can begin the process of port 
scanning: looking for holes in  the system through which  you  -- or  a malicious  intruder  --  can  gain 
access. A typical system has 2^16 -1 port numbers, each with its own TCP and UDP port that can be 
used to gain access if unprotected. The most popular port scanner for Linux, Nmap, is also available 
for  Windows.  Nmap  can  scan  a  system  in  variety  of  stealth  modes,  depending  upon  how 
undetectable  you  want  to  be.  Nmap  can  determine  a  lot  of  information  about  a  target,  like  which 
hosts are available, what services are offered and which OS is running. 
4. Vulnerability scanning tools:  A Vulnerability  scanner  allows  you to  connect  to  a target  system 
and  check  for  such  vulnerabilities  as  configuration  errors.  A  popular  vulnerability  scanner  is  the 
freely  available  open  source  tool  Nessus.  Nessus  is  an  extremely  powerful  scanner  that  can  be 
configured  to  run  a  variety  of  scans.  While  a  windows  graphical  front  end  is  available,  the  core 
Nessus  product  requires  Linux  to  run.  Microsoft's  Baseline  Security  Analyser  is  a  free  Windows 
vulnerability scanner. MBSA can be used to detect security configuration errors on local computers 
or  remotely  across  a  network.  Popular  commercial  vulnerability  scanners  include  Retina  Network 
Security Scanner, which runs on Windows, and SAINT, which runs on various Unix/Linux versions.

information. Ethical hacking can be categorized as a security assessment, a kind of training, a test for 
the  security  of  an  information  technology  environment.  An  ethical  hack  shows  the  risks  an 
information technology environment is facing and actions can be taken to reduce certain risks or to 
accept them.

Morals of an Ethical Hacker: 
1.  Obeying  the  Ethical  Hacking  Commandments:  Every  Ethical  Hacker  must  follow  few  basic 
principles.  Most  of  the  time  these  principles  get  ignored  or  forgotten  while  planning  or  executing 
ethical hacking tests. The test results are even very dangerous. 
2. Working ethically: The word ethical can be defined as working with high professional morals and 
principles.  Whether  you’re  performing  ethical  hacking  tests  against  your  own  systems  or  for 
someone  who  has  hired  you,  everything  you  do  as  an  ethical  Hacker  must  be  approved  and  must 
support the company’s goals. The misuse of information is absolutely not allowed. 
3.  Respecting  privacy:  Ethical  Hacker  must  treat  the  information  with  complete  respect.  The 
passwords pertaining to these information must be kept private. 
4. Not crashing your own systems: One of the biggest mistakes is when people try to hack their own 
systems; they come up with crashing their systems. The main reason for this is poor planning. These 
testers have not read the documentation or misunderstand the usage and power of the security tools 
and techniques. You can easily create miserable conditions on your systems when testing. Running 
too many tests too quickly on a system causes many system lockups. Many security assessment tools 
can control how many tests are performed on a system at the same time. These tools are especially 
handy if you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. 
5. Executing the plan: In Ethical hacking, time and patience are important. One must be very careful 

while performing the ethical hacking tests. 

 
TYPES OF HACKER 
White  Hat  Hackers:  White  hat  hackers  are ethical  hackers with  some  certifications  such  as  CEH 
(Certified Ethical Hacker). They break into systems just for legal purposes. Their main motive is to 
find  loopholes  in  the  networks  and  rectifying  them.  These  type  of  hackers  work  with  famous 
companies in securing their systems and protecting them against other hackers. 
Black Hat Hacker: A black hat hacker may or may not have any hacking certification but they hold 
good  knowledge  about  hacking.  They  use  their  skills  for  destructive  purposes.  They  break  into 
systems and networks either for fun or to gain some money by illegal means. They gain unauthorized 
access and destroy/steal confidential data and cause problems to their target.

Gray Hat Hacker: A grey hat hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A 
Grey  Hat  Hacker  may  surf  the  internet  and  hack  into  a  computer  system  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked. They may offer to repair their system 
for a small fee. 
 
MODE OF ETHICAL HACKING: 
Insider attack: This ethical hack simulates the types of attacks and activities that could be carried out 
by an authorized individual with a legitimate connection to the organization’s network. 
Outsider attack :This ethical hack seeks to simulate the types of attacks that could be launched across 
the  Internet.  It  could target Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol,  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP), 
Structured Query Language, or any other available services. 
Stolen  equipment  attack:  This  simulation  is  closely  related  to  a  physical  attack  as  it  targets  the 
organization’s  equipment.  It  could  seek  to  target  the  CEO’s  laptop  or  the  organization’s  backup 
tapes.  No  matter  what  the  target,  the  goal  is  to  extract  critical  information,  usernames,  and 
passwords. 
Physical  entry:  This  simulation  seeks  to  test  the  organization’s  physical  controls.  Systems  such  as 
doors,  gates,  locks,  guards,  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV),  and  alarms  are  tested  to  see  whether 
they can be bypassed. 
Bypassed  authentication  attack:  This  simulation  is  tasked  with  looking  for  wireless  access  points 
(WAP)  and  modems.  The  goal  is  to  see  whether  these  systems  are  secure  and  offer  sufficient 
authentication controls.  If the controls can be bypassed, the ethical hacker might probe to see what 
level of system control can be obtained. 
Social  engineering  attack:  This  simulation  does  not  target technical  systems or  physical  access. 
Social engineering attacks target the organization’s employees and seek to manipulate them to 
gain  privileged  information.  Proper  controls,  policies,  and  procedures  can  go  a  long  way  in 
defeating this form of attack. 

 
STEPS INVOLVED IN HACKING PROCESS 
 

Fig 2: Process of Hacking 

 

1. Reconnaissance: To be able to attack a system systematically, a hacker has to  know as much as 
possible  about  the  target.  It  is  important  to  get  an  overview  of  the  network  and  the  used  systems. 
Information such as DNS servers, administrator contacts and IP ranges can be collected. During the

reconnaissance  phase  different  types  of  tools  can  be  used  –  network  mapping,  network  and 
vulnerability  scanning  tools  are  commonly  used.  Cheops  for  example  is  a  very  good  network 
mapping  tool  generates  networking  graphs.  These  maps  gives  an  overview  about  the  network  and 
helps during the attack phase. A network mapping tool is very helpful when doing an internal ethical 
hack. At the end of the reconnaissance phase, an attacker should have a bunch of information about 
the target. With all these pieces of information, a promising attack path can be constructed. 
2.  Probe  and  Attack:  This  is  a  phase  2  process  as  shown  in  the  above  fig.  The  probe  and  attack 
phase  is  about  digging  in,  going  closer  and  getting  a  feeling  for  the  target.  It’s  time  to  try  the 
collected, possible vulnerabilities from the reconnaissance phase. Tools which can be used during the 
Probe and Attack phase are many-sided as web exploits; buffer overflows as well as brute-force can 
be applied. Even Trojans like Net Bus can be deployed to capture keystrokes, get screenshots or start 
applications  and  a  host.  The  probe  and  attack  phase  becomes  very  time  consuming,  especially  if 
brute force attack techniques are used or when individual pieces of software needs to be developed or 
analyzed. 
3.  Listening:  This  is  again  a  phase  2  process  i.e.  scanning  which  is  a  combination  of  Probe  and 
attack and listening. Listening to network traffic or to application data can sometimes help to attack a 
system or to advance deeper into a corporate network. Sniffers are heavily used during the listening 
phase. Sniffers can be simple or complex in nature. It can be console based or GUI driven.  
4. First Access: This is a phase 3 process  which is not about getting root access, it’s about  getting 
any access to a system be it a user or root account. Once this option is available it’s time to go for 
higher access levels or new systems which are reachable through the acquired system. 
5.  Advancement:  Phase  4  i.e.  Maintaining  access  is  a  combination  of  Advancement  and  Stealth 
process.  The  advancement  phase  is  probably  the  most  creative  demanding  stage,  as  unlimited 
possibilities are open. Sniffing network traffic may unveil certain passwords, needed usernames or e-
mail traffic with usable information. Sending mails to administrators faking some known users may 
help in getting desired information or even access to a new system. Last but not least, installing new 
tools and helpful scripts may help to dig in deeper or to scan log files for more details. 
6. Stealth: Some systems may be of high value – systems which act as routers or firewalls, systems 
where a root account could be acquired. To have access to such systems at a later time it is important 
to clean relevant log files. 
7. Takeover: Takeover is a phase 5 process. Once root access could be attained, the system can be 
considered  won.  From  there  on  it’s  possible  to  install  any  tools,  do  every  action  and  start  every 
services on that particular machine. Depending on the machine it can now be possible to misuse trust 
relationships, create new relationships or disable certain security checks. 
8. Cleanup: This could be instructions in the final report on how to remove certain Trojans but most 
of the time this will be done by the hacker itself. Removing all traces as far as possible is kind of a 
duty for the hacking craft. 
An ethical hack always poses a certain risks if not properly done. A hacker could use the deployed 
tools or hide his attacks. He could also try to attack the attackers system, therefore gain entry to the 
ethical hackers system and collect all information free of charge, sorted and prepared. Preparing an 
ethical  hack  and  hold  a  high  level  of  security  is  a  challenging  task  which  should  only  be  done  by 
professionals. 
 
TOOLS USED IN ETHICAL HACKING 
It is very much essential to make sure that we are using the right tool for ethical hacking process. It is 
important to know the personal  as well as technical limitations. Many tools focus on specific tests, 
but no one tool can test for everything. For example, to crack passwords (you need a cracking tools

such as LC4 or John the Ripper are needed. Similarly, for an in-depth analysis of a Web application, 
a Web-application assessment tool is more appropriate than a network analyser (such as Ethereal).  
There are various characteristics for the use of tools for ethical hacking which are as follows: 
1. Adequate documentation 
2. Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they can be fixed 
3. Updates and support when needed 
4. High level reports that can be presented to managers 
These features can save  the time and  effort  when we  are writing  the report. Time and patience are 
important  in  ethical  hacking  process.  One  should  be  careful  when  performing  the  ethical  hacking 
tests. It is not practical to make sure that no hackers are on our system. It is good to keep everything 
private  if  possible.  Do  encrypt  the  emails  and  files  if  possible.  The  list  and  description  of  various 
tools used in the ethical hacking process are as follows: 
 
1. Scanning tools: The Scanning tools are quite helpful in the ethical hacking process. In technical 
detail,  a  scanner  sends  a  message  requesting  to  open  a  connection  with  a  computer  on  a  particular 
port. (A port is an interface where different layers of software exchanges information). The computer 
has various options like - ignoring the message, responding negatively to the message, or opening a 
session.  Ignoring  the  message  is  the  safest  since  if  there  are  no  open  services  it  may  be  hard  for  a 
cracker to determine if a computer exists. Once a port scan reveals the existence of an open service, a 
cracker  can  attack  known  vulnerabilities.  Once  a  cracker  scans  all  computers  on  a  network  and 
creates a network map showing which computers are running on which operating systems and what 
services are available, almost any kind  of attack  is possible including automated scripting program 
attacks  and  social  engineered  attacks.  The  first  scanner  was  the  security  administrator’s  tool  for 
analysing  networks  SATAN  introduced  by  Dan  Farmer  in  1995.  SATAN  (Security  Administrator 
tool for analysing networks) could analyse any system accessible over the internet. But the question 
here is that why should anyone with internet presence and no interest in cracking other systems learn 
about  scanners?  The  answer  is  to  learn  what  crackers  will  see  in  their  own  internet  presence  since 
scanners  are  common  attack  starting  points.  Crackers  look  for  unauthorized  services  such  as 
someone  running  a  server  with  known  problems,  an  unauthorized  server  on  a  high  port  etc.  Port 
scanning  can  be  done  manually  from  a  single  computer  to  learn  about  target  systems  or  it  can  be 
done automatically by program originating from multiple computers on different networks to a single 
target  system  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Port  scanners  like  other  tools,  have  both  offensive  and 
defensive  applications-  what  makes  a  port  scanner  good  or  evil.  Actually,  a  port  scanner  is 
simultaneously  both  the  most  powerful  tool  an  ethical  hacker  can  use  in  protecting  the  network  of 
computers and the most powerful tool a cracker can use to generate attacks.

2.  Password  cracking  tools:  Password  cracking  does  not  have  to  involve  fancy  tools,  but  it  is  a 
tedious process. If the target doesn't lock you out after a specific number of tries, you can spend an 
infinite amount of time trying every combination of alphanumeric characters. It's just a question of

time and bandwidth before you break into a system. There are three basic types of password cracking 
tests that can be automated with tools: 
Dictionary- A file of words is run against user accounts, and if the password is a simple word, it can 
be found pretty quickly. 
Hybrid: A common method utilized by users to change passwords is to add a number or symbol to 
the end.A hybrid  attack  works like  a dictionary  attack, but  adds simple  numbers or symbols to the 
password attempt. 
Brute  force:  The  most  time  consuming,  but  comprehensive  way  to  crack  a  password.  Every 

combination of character is tried until the password is broken. 

 

 
Brutus 
 

It  is  a  password  cracking  tool  that  can  perform  both  dictionary  attacks  and  brute 
force  attacks  where  passwords  are  randomly  generated  from  a  given  character. 
Brutus  can  crack  the  multiple  authentication  types,  HTTP  (Basic  authentication, 
HTML Form/CGI), POP3, FTP, SMB and Telnet. 

Web 
cracker 

It is a simple tool that takes text lists of usernames and passwords, and uses them as 
dictionaries to implement basic authentication password guessing. 

 
ObiWan 

It  is  a  Web  password  cracking  tool  that  can  work  through  a  proxy.  ObiWan  uses 
wordlists  and  alternations  of  numeric  or  alpha-numeric  characters  as  possible 
passwords. 

Table 2: Web password cracking tool 

3. Port Scanning tools: Port scanning is one of the most common reconnaissance techniques used by 
testers  to  discover  the  vulnerabilities  in  the  services  listening  at  well-known  ports.  Once  you've 
identified the IP address of a target system through foot printing, you can begin the process of port 
scanning: looking for holes in  the system through which  you  -- or  a malicious  intruder  --  can  gain 
access. A typical system has 2^16 -1 port numbers, each with its own TCP and UDP port that can be 
used to gain access if unprotected. The most popular port scanner for Linux, Nmap, is also available 
for  Windows.  Nmap  can  scan  a  system  in  variety  of  stealth  modes,  depending  upon  how 
undetectable  you  want  to  be.  Nmap  can  determine  a  lot  of  information  about  a  target,  like  which 
hosts are available, what services are offered and which OS is running. 
4. Vulnerability scanning tools:  A Vulnerability  scanner  allows  you to  connect  to  a target  system 
and  check  for  such  vulnerabilities  as  configuration  errors.  A  popular  vulnerability  scanner  is  the 
freely  available  open  source  tool  Nessus.  Nessus  is  an  extremely  powerful  scanner  that  can  be 
configured  to  run  a  variety  of  scans.  While  a  windows  graphical  front  end  is  available,  the  core 
Nessus  product  requires  Linux  to  run.  Microsoft's  Baseline  Security  Analyser  is  a  free  Windows 
vulnerability scanner. MBSA can be used to detect security configuration errors on local computers 
or  remotely  across  a  network.  Popular  commercial  vulnerability  scanners  include  Retina  Network 
Security Scanner, which runs on Windows, and SAINT, which runs on various Unix/Linux versions.

SYSTEM SECURITY 
System security means securing a system from unauthorized access. Broadly we can divide security 
in three divisions  
1. System security  
2. Data Security  
3. Network Security  
System security is further divided into two divisions  
1. Data accessible restriction

CONCLUSION 
This paper addressed ethical hacking from several perspectives. Ethical hacking seems to be a new 
buzz  word  although  the  techniques  and  ideas  of  testing  security  by  attacking  an  installation  aren’t 
new  at  all.  But,  with  the  present  poor  security  on  the  internet,  ethical  hacking  may  be  the  most 
effective way to plug security holes and prevent intrusions.  

Install and Use Anti-Virus, firewalls & Anit key logger Programs  
While installing OS like Windows XP give admin password.  
Use Care When Reading Email with Attachments and following links.  
Install and Use a Firewall Program  
Make Backups of Important Files and Folders  
Use Strong Passwords and change it regularly as you change your toothbrush.  
Use Care When Downloading and Installing Programs  
Install and Use a Hardware Firewall  
Install and Use a File Encryption Program and Access Controls  
Safeguard your Data  
Real-World Warnings keep you safe online.  
Keeping Children Safe Online  
Use SYSKEY for password protection.  

On  the  other  hand  ethical  hacking  tools  have  also  been  notorious  tools  for  crackers.  So,  at 
present  the  tactical  objective  is  to  stay  one  step  ahead  of  the  crackers.  Ethical  Hacking  is  a  tool, 
which if properly utilized, can prove useful for understanding the weaknesses of a network and how 
they might be exploited. After all, ethical hacking will play a certain role in the security assessment 
offerings and certainly has earned its place among other security assessments. In conclusion, it must 
be said that the ethical hacker is an educator who seeks to enlighten not only the customer, but also 
the security industry as a whole. In an effort to accomplish this, let us welcome the Ethical Hacker 
into our ranks as a partner in this quest.

Abstract:  
During the development of the Internet, computer security has become a major concern for different 
industries, businesses and Governments. The organizations use the Internet for electronic commerce, 
advertising,  information  distribution  and  access,  and  other  pursuits,  but  they  are  worried  about  the 
possibility  of  being  "hacked”.  Ethical  Hacking  increases  security  protection.  Public  and  Private 
organizations  migrate  more  of  their  critical  information  through  the  Internet,  criminals  have  more 
opportunity and incentive to gain access to sensitive information through the Web application. Thus 
the  need  of  protecting  the  systems  from  the  nuisance  of  hacking  generated  by  the  hackers  is  to 
promote  the  persons  who  will  punch  back  the  illegal  attacks  on  our  computer  systems.  So,  Ethical 
hacking is an assessment to test and check an information technology environment for possible weak 
links  and  vulnerabilities.  Ethical  hacking  describes  the  process  of  hacking  a  network  with  good 
intentions. This paper describes what ethical hacking is, what it can do, methods & modes of ethical 
hacking,  types  of  ethical  hacking,  different  tools  used  for  ethical  hacking  and  concept  of  system 
security.

INTRODUCTION 
The  vast  growth  of  Internet  has  brought  many  technological  advances  like  electronic  commerce, 
email, easy access to vast stores of reference material etc .In the other side the hackers secretly steal 
the organization’s information  and transmit  it  to the open internet.  These types of  criminal  hackers 
are called black hat hackers. So, to overcome these major issues, another category of hackers came 
into  existence  and  these  hackers  are  termed  as  ethical  hackers  or  white  hat  hackers.  This  paper 
describes and how they go about helping their customers and plug up security holes. Ethical hackers 
perform  the  hacks  as  security  tests  for  their  systems.  This  type  of  hacking  is  always  legal  and 
trustworthy.  In  other  terms  ethical  hacking  is  the  testing  of  resources  for  the  betterment  of 
technology and is focused on securing and protecting IP systems. 

So, in case of computer security, these tiger teams or ethical hackers would employ the same 
tricks  and  techniques  that  hacker  use  but  in  a  legal  manner.  They  would  neither  damage  the  target 
systems  nor  steal  information.  Instead,  they  would  evaluate  the  target  system’s  security  and  report 
back  to  the  owners  with  the  vulnerabilities  they  found  and  instructions  for  how  to  remedy  them. 
Ethical hacking is a way of doing a security assessment. Like all other assessments an ethical hack is 
a random sample and passing an ethical hack doesn’t mean there are no security issues. An ethical 
hack’s results is a detailed report of the findings as well as a  testimony that a hacker with a certain 
amount  of  time  and  skills  is  or  isn’t  able  to  successfully  attack  a  system  or  get  access  to  certain

information. Ethical hacking can be categorized as a security assessment, a kind of training, a test for 
the  security  of  an  information  technology  environment.  An  ethical  hack  shows  the  risks  an 
information technology environment is facing and actions can be taken to reduce certain risks or to 
accept them.

Morals of an Ethical Hacker: 
1.  Obeying  the  Ethical  Hacking  Commandments:  Every  Ethical  Hacker  must  follow  few  basic 
principles.  Most  of  the  time  these  principles  get  ignored  or  forgotten  while  planning  or  executing 
ethical hacking tests. The test results are even very dangerous. 
2. Working ethically: The word ethical can be defined as working with high professional morals and 
principles.  Whether  you’re  performing  ethical  hacking  tests  against  your  own  systems  or  for 
someone  who  has  hired  you,  everything  you  do  as  an  ethical  Hacker  must  be  approved  and  must 
support the company’s goals. The misuse of information is absolutely not allowed. 
3.  Respecting  privacy:  Ethical  Hacker  must  treat  the  information  with  complete  respect.  The 
passwords pertaining to these information must be kept private. 
4. Not crashing your own systems: One of the biggest mistakes is when people try to hack their own 
systems; they come up with crashing their systems. The main reason for this is poor planning. These 
testers have not read the documentation or misunderstand the usage and power of the security tools 
and techniques. You can easily create miserable conditions on your systems when testing. Running 
too many tests too quickly on a system causes many system lockups. Many security assessment tools 
can control how many tests are performed on a system at the same time. These tools are especially 
handy if you need to run the tests on production systems during regular business hours. 
5. Executing the plan: In Ethical hacking, time and patience are important. One must be very careful 

while performing the ethical hacking tests. 

 
TYPES OF HACKER 
White  Hat  Hackers:  White  hat  hackers  are ethical  hackers with  some  certifications  such  as  CEH 
(Certified Ethical Hacker). They break into systems just for legal purposes. Their main motive is to 
find  loopholes  in  the  networks  and  rectifying  them.  These  type  of  hackers  work  with  famous 
companies in securing their systems and protecting them against other hackers. 
Black Hat Hacker: A black hat hacker may or may not have any hacking certification but they hold 
good  knowledge  about  hacking.  They  use  their  skills  for  destructive  purposes.  They  break  into 
systems and networks either for fun or to gain some money by illegal means. They gain unauthorized 
access and destroy/steal confidential data and cause problems to their target.

Gray Hat Hacker: A grey hat hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A 
Grey  Hat  Hacker  may  surf  the  internet  and  hack  into  a  computer  system  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked. They may offer to repair their system 
for a small fee. 
 
MODE OF ETHICAL HACKING: 
Insider attack: This ethical hack simulates the types of attacks and activities that could be carried out 
by an authorized individual with a legitimate connection to the organization’s network. 
Outsider attack :This ethical hack seeks to simulate the types of attacks that could be launched across 
the  Internet.  It  could target Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol,  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP), 
Structured Query Language, or any other available services. 
Stolen  equipment  attack:  This  simulation  is  closely  related  to  a  physical  attack  as  it  targets  the 
organization’s  equipment.  It  could  seek  to  target  the  CEO’s  laptop  or  the  organization’s  backup 
tapes.  No  matter  what  the  target,  the  goal  is  to  extract  critical  information,  usernames,  and 
passwords. 
Physical  entry:  This  simulation  seeks  to  test  the  organization’s  physical  controls.  Systems  such  as 
doors,  gates,  locks,  guards,  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV),  and  alarms  are  tested  to  see  whether 
they can be bypassed. 
Bypassed  authentication  attack:  This  simulation  is  tasked  with  looking  for  wireless  access  points 
(WAP)  and  modems.  The  goal  is  to  see  whether  these  systems  are  secure  and  offer  sufficient 
authentication controls.  If the controls can be bypassed, the ethical hacker might probe to see what 
level of system control can be obtained. 
Social  engineering  attack:  This  simulation  does  not  target technical  systems or  physical  access. 
Social engineering attacks target the organization’s employees and seek to manipulate them to 
gain  privileged  information.  Proper  controls,  policies,  and  procedures  can  go  a  long  way  in 
defeating this form of attack. 

 
STEPS INVOLVED IN HACKING PROCESS 
 

Fig 2: Process of Hacking 

 

1. Reconnaissance: To be able to attack a system systematically, a hacker has to  know as much as 
possible  about  the  target.  It  is  important  to  get  an  overview  of  the  network  and  the  used  systems. 
Information such as DNS servers, administrator contacts and IP ranges can be collected. During the

reconnaissance  phase  different  types  of  tools  can  be  used  –  network  mapping,  network  and 
vulnerability  scanning  tools  are  commonly  used.  Cheops  for  example  is  a  very  good  network 
mapping  tool  generates  networking  graphs.  These  maps  gives  an  overview  about  the  network  and 
helps during the attack phase. A network mapping tool is very helpful when doing an internal ethical 
hack. At the end of the reconnaissance phase, an attacker should have a bunch of information about 
the target. With all these pieces of information, a promising attack path can be constructed. 
2.  Probe  and  Attack:  This  is  a  phase  2  process  as  shown  in  the  above  fig.  The  probe  and  attack 
phase  is  about  digging  in,  going  closer  and  getting  a  feeling  for  the  target.  It’s  time  to  try  the 
collected, possible vulnerabilities from the reconnaissance phase. Tools which can be used during the 
Probe and Attack phase are many-sided as web exploits; buffer overflows as well as brute-force can 
be applied. Even Trojans like Net Bus can be deployed to capture keystrokes, get screenshots or start 
applications  and  a  host.  The  probe  and  attack  phase  becomes  very  time  consuming,  especially  if 
brute force attack techniques are used or when individual pieces of software needs to be developed or 
analyzed. 
3.  Listening:  This  is  again  a  phase  2  process  i.e.  scanning  which  is  a  combination  of  Probe  and 
attack and listening. Listening to network traffic or to application data can sometimes help to attack a 
system or to advance deeper into a corporate network. Sniffers are heavily used during the listening 
phase. Sniffers can be simple or complex in nature. It can be console based or GUI driven.  
4. First Access: This is a phase 3 process  which is not about getting root access, it’s about  getting 
any access to a system be it a user or root account. Once this option is available it’s time to go for 
higher access levels or new systems which are reachable through the acquired system. 
5.  Advancement:  Phase  4  i.e.  Maintaining  access  is  a  combination  of  Advancement  and  Stealth 
process.  The  advancement  phase  is  probably  the  most  creative  demanding  stage,  as  unlimited 
possibilities are open. Sniffing network traffic may unveil certain passwords, needed usernames or e-
mail traffic with usable information. Sending mails to administrators faking some known users may 
help in getting desired information or even access to a new system. Last but not least, installing new 
tools and helpful scripts may help to dig in deeper or to scan log files for more details. 
6. Stealth: Some systems may be of high value – systems which act as routers or firewalls, systems 
where a root account could be acquired. To have access to such systems at a later time it is important 
to clean relevant log files. 
7. Takeover: Takeover is a phase 5 process. Once root access could be attained, the system can be 
considered  won.  From  there  on  it’s  possible  to  install  any  tools,  do  every  action  and  start  every 
services on that particular machine. Depending on the machine it can now be possible to misuse trust 
relationships, create new relationships or disable certain security checks. 
8. Cleanup: This could be instructions in the final report on how to remove certain Trojans but most 
of the time this will be done by the hacker itself. Removing all traces as far as possible is kind of a 
duty for the hacking craft. 
An ethical hack always poses a certain risks if not properly done. A hacker could use the deployed 
tools or hide his attacks. He could also try to attack the attackers system, therefore gain entry to the 
ethical hackers system and collect all information free of charge, sorted and prepared. Preparing an 
ethical  hack  and  hold  a  high  level  of  security  is  a  challenging  task  which  should  only  be  done  by 
professionals. 
 
TOOLS USED IN ETHICAL HACKING 
It is very much essential to make sure that we are using the right tool for ethical hacking process. It is 
important to know the personal  as well as technical limitations. Many tools focus on specific tests, 
but no one tool can test for everything. For example, to crack passwords (you need a cracking tools

such as LC4 or John the Ripper are needed. Similarly, for an in-depth analysis of a Web application, 
a Web-application assessment tool is more appropriate than a network analyser (such as Ethereal).  
There are various characteristics for the use of tools for ethical hacking which are as follows: 
1. Adequate documentation 
2. Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they can be fixed 
3. Updates and support when needed 
4. High level reports that can be presented to managers 
These features can save  the time and  effort  when we  are writing  the report. Time and patience are 
important  in  ethical  hacking  process.  One  should  be  careful  when  performing  the  ethical  hacking 
tests. It is not practical to make sure that no hackers are on our system. It is good to keep everything 
private  if  possible.  Do  encrypt  the  emails  and  files  if  possible.  The  list  and  description  of  various 
tools used in the ethical hacking process are as follows: 
 
1. Scanning tools: The Scanning tools are quite helpful in the ethical hacking process. In technical 
detail,  a  scanner  sends  a  message  requesting  to  open  a  connection  with  a  computer  on  a  particular 
port. (A port is an interface where different layers of software exchanges information). The computer 
has various options like - ignoring the message, responding negatively to the message, or opening a 
session.  Ignoring  the  message  is  the  safest  since  if  there  are  no  open  services  it  may  be  hard  for  a 
cracker to determine if a computer exists. Once a port scan reveals the existence of an open service, a 
cracker  can  attack  known  vulnerabilities.  Once  a  cracker  scans  all  computers  on  a  network  and 
creates a network map showing which computers are running on which operating systems and what 
services are available, almost any kind  of attack  is possible including automated scripting program 
attacks  and  social  engineered  attacks.  The  first  scanner  was  the  security  administrator’s  tool  for 
analysing  networks  SATAN  introduced  by  Dan  Farmer  in  1995.  SATAN  (Security  Administrator 
tool for analysing networks) could analyse any system accessible over the internet. But the question 
here is that why should anyone with internet presence and no interest in cracking other systems learn 
about  scanners?  The  answer  is  to  learn  what  crackers  will  see  in  their  own  internet  presence  since 
scanners  are  common  attack  starting  points.  Crackers  look  for  unauthorized  services  such  as 
someone  running  a  server  with  known  problems,  an  unauthorized  server  on  a  high  port  etc.  Port 
scanning  can  be  done  manually  from  a  single  computer  to  learn  about  target  systems  or  it  can  be 
done automatically by program originating from multiple computers on different networks to a single 
target  system  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Port  scanners  like  other  tools,  have  both  offensive  and 
defensive  applications-  what  makes  a  port  scanner  good  or  evil.  Actually,  a  port  scanner  is 
simultaneously  both  the  most  powerful  tool  an  ethical  hacker  can  use  in  protecting  the  network  of 
computers and the most powerful tool a cracker can use to generate attacks.

2.  Password  cracking  tools:  Password  cracking  does  not  have  to  involve  fancy  tools,  but  it  is  a 
tedious process. If the target doesn't lock you out after a specific number of tries, you can spend an 
infinite amount of time trying every combination of alphanumeric characters. It's just a question of

time and bandwidth before you break into a system. There are three basic types of password cracking 
tests that can be automated with tools: 
Dictionary- A file of words is run against user accounts, and if the password is a simple word, it can 
be found pretty quickly. 
Hybrid: A common method utilized by users to change passwords is to add a number or symbol to 
the end.A hybrid  attack  works like  a dictionary  attack, but  adds simple  numbers or symbols to the 
password attempt. 
Brute  force:  The  most  time  consuming,  but  comprehensive  way  to  crack  a  password.  Every 

combination of character is tried until the password is broken. 

 

 
Brutus 
 

It  is  a  password  cracking  tool  that  can  perform  both  dictionary  attacks  and  brute 
force  attacks  where  passwords  are  randomly  generated  from  a  given  character. 
Brutus  can  crack  the  multiple  authentication  types,  HTTP  (Basic  authentication, 
HTML Form/CGI), POP3, FTP, SMB and Telnet. 

Web 
cracker 

It is a simple tool that takes text lists of usernames and passwords, and uses them as 
dictionaries to implement basic authentication password guessing. 

 
ObiWan 

It  is  a  Web  password  cracking  tool  that  can  work  through  a  proxy.  ObiWan  uses 
wordlists  and  alternations  of  numeric  or  alpha-numeric  characters  as  possible 
passwords. 

Table 2: Web password cracking tool 

3. Port Scanning tools: Port scanning is one of the most common reconnaissance techniques used by 
testers  to  discover  the  vulnerabilities  in  the  services  listening  at  well-known  ports.  Once  you've 
identified the IP address of a target system through foot printing, you can begin the process of port 
scanning: looking for holes in  the system through which  you  -- or  a malicious  intruder  --  can  gain 
access. A typical system has 2^16 -1 port numbers, each with its own TCP and UDP port that can be 
used to gain access if unprotected. The most popular port scanner for Linux, Nmap, is also available 
for  Windows.  Nmap  can  scan  a  system  in  variety  of  stealth  modes,  depending  upon  how 
undetectable  you  want  to  be.  Nmap  can  determine  a  lot  of  information  about  a  target,  like  which 
hosts are available, what services are offered and which OS is running. 
4. Vulnerability scanning tools:  A Vulnerability  scanner  allows  you to  connect  to  a target  system 
and  check  for  such  vulnerabilities  as  configuration  errors.  A  popular  vulnerability  scanner  is  the 
freely  available  open  source  tool  Nessus.  Nessus  is  an  extremely  powerful  scanner  that  can  be 
configured  to  run  a  variety  of  scans.  While  a  windows  graphical  front  end  is  available,  the  core 
Nessus  product  requires  Linux  to  run.  Microsoft's  Baseline  Security  Analyser  is  a  free  Windows 
vulnerability scanner. MBSA can be used to detect security configuration errors on local computers 
or  remotely  across  a  network.  Popular  commercial  vulnerability  scanners  include  Retina  Network 
Security Scanner, which runs on Windows, and SAINT, which runs on various Unix/Linux versions.

SYSTEM SECURITY 
System security means securing a system from unauthorized access. Broadly we can divide security 
in three divisions  
1. System security  
2. Data Security  
3. Network Security  
System security is further divided into two divisions  
1. Data accessible restriction  
2. System accessible restriction

CONCLUSION 
This paper addressed ethical hacking from several perspectives. Ethical hacking seems to be a new 
buzz  word  although  the  techniques  and  ideas  of  testing  security  by  attacking  an  installation  aren’t 
new  at  all.  But,  with  the  present  poor  security  on  the  internet,  ethical  hacking  may  be  the  most 
effective way to plug security holes and prevent intrusions.  

Install and Use Anti-Virus, firewalls & Anit key logger Programs  
While installing OS like Windows XP give admin password.  
Use Care When Reading Email with Attachments and following links.  
Install and Use a Firewall Program  
Make Backups of Important Files and Folders  
Use Strong Passwords and change it regularly as you change your toothbrush.  
Use Care When Downloading and Installing Programs  
Install and Use a Hardware Firewall  
Install and Use a File Encryption Program and Access Controls  
Safeguard your Data  
Real-World Warnings keep you safe online.  
Keeping Children Safe Online  
Use SYSKEY for password protection.  

On  the  other  hand  ethical  hacking  tools  have  also  been  notorious  tools  for  crackers.  So,  at 
present  the  tactical  objective  is  to  stay  one  step  ahead  of  the  crackers.  Ethical  Hacking  is  a  tool, 
which if properly utilized, can prove useful for understanding the weaknesses of a network and how 
they might be exploited. After all, ethical hacking will play a certain role in the security assessment 
offerings and certainly has earned its place among other security assessments. In conclusion, it must 
be said that the ethical hacker is an educator who seeks to enlighten not only the customer, but also 
the security industry as a whole. In an effort to accomplish this, let us welcome the Ethical Hacker 
into our ranks as a partner in this quest.
