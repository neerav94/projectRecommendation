Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)

believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,

in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his

where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

(cid:90) r

l = l(X = xm) =

f (θ)dθ = 1 − F (xm).

(1)

xm

dxm = −f (xm) < 0, implying the proportion of individuals
Thus, dl(xm)
without self-defense investments is strictly decreasing in xm as more
in self-defense with increasing
users ﬁnd it preferable to invest
marginal costs.

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in

on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

0

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= A1 + B1 + C1 + D1,

(6)

where

A1 = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )]f (xm1 ),

B1 = E[U 1

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 6 can be written as

(7)

where

F = {E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]}f (xm1 ).

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xeq1 )]−E[U 1

(5)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(8)

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.
Keywords: security, cyber-insurance, market, equilibrium

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

dxm = −f (xm) < 0, implying the proportion of individuals
Thus, dl(xm)
without self-defense investments is strictly decreasing in xm as more

users ﬁnd it preferable to invest
marginal costs.

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

5In practice, for reliability purposes, it is possible to enforce compulsory
insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is
generally owned by a single entity providing application services to numerous
customers.

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

def ] = E[U 1

E[U 1

or
E[U 1

def ] = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x).
def ] ≥

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), x) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), x)] − E[U 1

When X = r, we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), r) = (1 − pd){U (w0 − r) − U (w0)} < 0,

(2)

(3)

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), 0) = pd(1 − qmax){U (w0) − U (w0 − r)} > 0.

(4)

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
In the case of imperfect prevention, when network
users do not have cyber-insurance protection, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense, xeq1. Users
facing protection costs below xeq1 invest in self-defense mechanisms,
whereas other users do not. This NE cost of self-defense does not
result in maximizing user social welfare in the network, i.e., i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 1 follows from the ﬁrst fundamental theorem in
welfare economics [13] which states that the network externalities
generated by user investments are not internalized (i.e., users do not
pay for externality beneﬁts), by the users for public goods such as
security measures, and results in the free-riding problem. Thus, risk -
averse users do not end up putting in optimal self-defense efforts, and
this results in sub-optimal network security, i.e., the average of the
sum of user risk probabilities (denoted as p(xm)), is not minimized.
With respect to the welfare of users, the ones who face a cost of
investment above the NE cost do not buy security products and are not
satisﬁed because they cannot defend themselves on being attacked.
The ones who do invest in security measures are better off but are
still susceptible to indirect risks. Security vendors like Symantec and
Microsoft make proﬁts as per their current security product market
scenario. The case of no insurance is currently the situation in Internet
security, apart from a few organizations that are insured.

IV. SCENARIO 2: MONOPOLY MARKETS

In this section we analyze a regulated monopolistic cyber-
insurance market under conditions of imperfect prevention (self-
protection does not guarantee risk removal). Here the term ‘regulated’
implies the role of the government to (i) ensure Internet users buy
compulsory cyber-insurance, (ii) enable insurers to adopt premium
discrimination amongst clients based on the user risk types , and (iii)
allow basic user security behavior monitoring by insurance agencies.
We divide this section in two parts: in the ﬁrst part we analyze
the case when there is no contract discrimination amongst clients.
In the second part we analyze the case with clients being contract
discriminated.

A. Case 1- No Contract Discrimination

The expected utility of a user who does not invest is self-defense

in Scenario 2 is given as

E[U 2

ndef ] = E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))] = pdU (w0−r+r−P )+(1−pd)Q2,
where Q2 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
2, and is given as
Q2 = q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − r + r − P ) + (1− q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − P 2
Here P (p, r) = (1 + λ)p · r = P 2
11 is the insurance premium that
a user in Scenario 2, Case 1, and not investing in security (hence
denoted as P 2
11), pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage
of his loss (hence the ‘−r+r’ term in U), and R = r is the risk faced
by the user. xm2 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 2.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-defense
mechanisms is given as

and at X = r we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), r) = U (w0 − r) − U (w0 − pdr) < 0.

In most practical cases, Equations 11 and 12 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ2(·) and imply that Ψ2(·) is decreasing in x and
there exists xeq2  (0, r), such that

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xeq2 ) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xeq2 )]−E[U 2

ndef (l(xeq2 ))] = 0.

def ] ≥ E[U 2

(13)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution, xeq2, to E[U 2
ndef ] is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost of protection investment, and equals xm2,
the marginal cost of making self-defense investments in Scenario 2.
This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-defense is less than
xeq2 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and cyber-insurance,
whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically,
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

the expression for the Nash equilibrium can be

U (w0 − xeq2 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq2 ) · r),

(14)

which leads to a NE value given by

xeq2 = p(xeq2 ) · r.

(15)
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 2 as
SW2(xm2 ) and is evaluated to

for SW2(xm2 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt2, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

1

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

(cid:90) r

l = l(X = xm) =

f (θ)dθ = 1 − F (xm).

dxm = −f (xm) < 0, implying the proportion of individuals
Thus, dl(xm)
without self-defense investments is strictly decreasing in xm as more
in self-defense with increasing
users ﬁnd it preferable to invest
marginal costs.

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

5In practice, for reliability purposes, it is possible to enforce compulsory
insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is
generally owned by a single entity providing application services to numerous
customers.

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

def ] = E[U 1

E[U 1

or
E[U 1

def ] = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x).
def ] ≥

A user would want to invest in loss prevention only if E[U 1

Deﬁne Ψ1(l(xm1 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), x) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), x)] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )].

When X = r, we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), r) = (1 − pd){U (w0 − r) − U (w0)} < 0,

(2)

(3)

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), 0) = pd(1 − qmax){U (w0) − U (w0 − r)} > 0.

(4)

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

0

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= A1 + B1 + C1 + D1,

(6)

where

A1 = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )]f (xm1 ),

B1 = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]

dl(xm1 )

C1 =

(cid:90) xm1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]
dxm1

l(xm1 ),

δE[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]

δxm1

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 6 can be written as

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= F + C1 + D1,

(7)

where

F = {E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]}f (xm1 ).

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xeq1 )]−E[U 1

(5)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(8)

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

4

in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
In the case of imperfect prevention, when network
users do not have cyber-insurance protection, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense, xeq1. Users
facing protection costs below xeq1 invest in self-defense mechanisms,
whereas other users do not. This NE cost of self-defense does not
result in maximizing user social welfare in the network, i.e., i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 1 follows from the ﬁrst fundamental theorem in
welfare economics [13] which states that the network externalities
generated by user investments are not internalized (i.e., users do not
pay for externality beneﬁts), by the users for public goods such as
security measures, and results in the free-riding problem. Thus, risk -
averse users do not end up putting in optimal self-defense efforts, and
this results in sub-optimal network security, i.e., the average of the
sum of user risk probabilities (denoted as p(xm)), is not minimized.
With respect to the welfare of users, the ones who face a cost of
investment above the NE cost do not buy security products and are not
satisﬁed because they cannot defend themselves on being attacked.
The ones who do invest in security measures are better off but are
still susceptible to indirect risks. Security vendors like Symantec and
Microsoft make proﬁts as per their current security product market
scenario. The case of no insurance is currently the situation in Internet
security, apart from a few organizations that are insured.

IV. SCENARIO 2: MONOPOLY MARKETS

In this section we analyze a regulated monopolistic cyber-
insurance market under conditions of imperfect prevention (self-
protection does not guarantee risk removal). Here the term ‘regulated’
implies the role of the government to (i) ensure Internet users buy
compulsory cyber-insurance, (ii) enable insurers to adopt premium
discrimination amongst clients based on the user risk types , and (iii)
allow basic user security behavior monitoring by insurance agencies.
We divide this section in two parts: in the ﬁrst part we analyze
the case when there is no contract discrimination amongst clients.
In the second part we analyze the case with clients being contract
discriminated.

A. Case 1- No Contract Discrimination

The expected utility of a user who does not invest is self-defense

in Scenario 2 is given as

E[U 2

ndef ] = E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))] = pdU (w0−r+r−P )+(1−pd)Q2,
where Q2 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
2, and is given as
Q2 = q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − r + r − P ) + (1− q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − P 2
Here P (p, r) = (1 + λ)p · r = P 2
11 is the insurance premium that
a user in Scenario 2, Case 1, and not investing in security (hence
denoted as P 2
11), pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage
of his loss (hence the ‘−r+r’ term in U), and R = r is the risk faced
by the user. xm2 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 2.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-defense
mechanisms is given as

11).

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), x) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), x)] − E[U 2

When X = 0, we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), 0) = U (w0 − P 2

12) − U (w0 − P 2

11) > 0,

and at X = r we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), r) = U (w0 − r) − U (w0 − pdr) < 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

In most practical cases, Equations 11 and 12 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ2(·) and imply that Ψ2(·) is decreasing in x and
there exists xeq2  (0, r), such that

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xeq2 ) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xeq2 )]−E[U 2

ndef (l(xeq2 ))] = 0.

def ] ≥ E[U 2

(13)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution, xeq2, to E[U 2
ndef ] is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost of protection investment, and equals xm2,
the marginal cost of making self-defense investments in Scenario 2.
This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-defense is less than
xeq2 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and cyber-insurance,
whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically,
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

the expression for the Nash equilibrium can be

U (w0 − xeq2 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq2 ) · r),

(14)

which leads to a NE value given by

xeq2 = p(xeq2 ) · r.

(15)
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 2 as
SW2(xm2 ) and is evaluated to

(cid:90) ∞

0
The ﬁrst term of SW2(xm2 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents adopting self-defense, the second term denotes the sum
of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-defense
and buying only cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW2(xm2 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt2, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW2(xm2 )

= A21 + B21 + C21 + D21,

(16)

where

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 16 can be written as

= G + C21 + D21,

(17)

where

G = {E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xm2 )] − EU 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))}f (xm2 )

Here, the ﬁrst term of G in brackets is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xm2 ), C21 and D21 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists x = xsopt2 such dSW2(x)
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dx

xsopt2 = argmaxxSW2(x).

(18)

Substituting xeq2 for xm2 in Equation 17, and using Equation 13 we
get

dSW2(x)

dx

|x=xeq2 > 0.

(19)

This implies that xsopt2 > xeq2 and l(xsopt2 ) < l(xeq2 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem for Scenario 2, Case 1.
Theorem 2. Under compulsory monopolistic cyber-insurance, there
exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense,
xeq2. Users facing protection costs below xeq2 invest in self-defense
mechanisms, whereas other users only buy cyber-insurance. This NE
cost of self-defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare
in the network (i.e., the proportion of users not resorting to self-
defense mechanisms is higher in the Nash equilibrium than in the
welfare optimum.), and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users to
invest in self-defense mechanisms.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 2 is that externalities caused due to individual user
investment in security mechanisms are not internalized by the users,
and as a result social welfare is not maximized at Nash equilibrium.
The implications of the theorem are (i) cyber-insurance does not
incentivize network users to invest in self-defense mechanisms6, (ii)
cyber-insurance exacerbates the moral hazard problem, i.e., once
users buy insurance they do not spend as much in self-defense as
they would without it. This makes sense from an economic viewpoint
as users would loath to bear excessive cost in self-defense if there
is an alternative to canceling out risk albeit at an unfair premium,
i.e., premium greater than the fair amount, and (iii) cyber-insurance
might increase individual user utilities (as users get full coverage
of their losses) but does not positively contribute to the increase
of overall network security. As a result a regulator interested in
improving network security is not satisﬁed. These implications are
also mentioned by the authors in [15] for a competitive market setting.
Also note that since λ ≥ 0, the cyber-insurer makes non-negative
expected proﬁts. A security vendor does not satisfy its interests from
an existing cyber-insurance market, i.e., compared to Scenario 1, as
the sales of its products are going to go down.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with no
client contract discrimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e.,
the social welfare of users is not maximized at NE. This does not
help satisfy the interests of all the market stakeholders.

B. Case 2 - Contract Discrimination

In the previous section we saw and investigated why inspite
of mandating cyber-insurance on network users, a social welfare
maximum could not be reached. In this section we aim to improve
upon this drawback by allowing the insurer to premium discriminate
its clients, and keeping all other
factors the same as in the

6As an exception, cyber-insurance incentivizes self-defense investments of
users in the case when insurable and non-insurable risk co-exist together and
it is not easy for a user to distinguish between the two [18]. For example,
a hardware failure can be caused due to either a security lapse, or hardware
defect, and it is difﬁcult for a naive user to ﬁgure out the right reason for the
failure.

case without premium discrimination7. The rationale for client
discrimination is that users who take (do not
take) appropriate
self-defense actions reduce (increase)
their chances of getting
attacked as well as reduce (increase) other network users’ chances
of facing a loss. In order to differentiate between clients,
the
cyber-insurer imposes a ﬁne of amount a per user of high risk type,
and provides a rebate of amount b per user of low risk type. A user
is considered of high risk type if he does not invest in self-defense
mechanisms, and is considered of low risk type when he does
invest in the same. A user decides whether it wants to invest in
self-protection depending on the cost of investment and the provided
ﬁne/rebate. The sequence of the protocol between the insurer and
the clients can be seen as follows: Stage 1 - the insurer advertises
appropriate contracts to its clients that include the ﬁne/rebate values.
Stage 2 - the users simultaneously decide whether or not to invest
in self-defense based on the cost of investment and their signed
contract information, and Stage 3 - when a coverage claim is ﬁled
by clients, the cyber-insurer examines the claims and charges the
suitable rebate/ﬁne to each client based on whether his investment
amounts were above or below a particular threshold. Here we
assume that the cyber-insurer can observe or stochastically learn the
investment amounts of its clients after a claim is made.

Note that the premium differentiation approach is feasible only
in the case of monopolistic cyber-insurance markets or imperfect
competitive markets. In the case of perfectly competitive markets,
price competition will not allow insurers to discriminate amongst their
clients for commercial demand purposes and insurers will have to sell
contracts at absolute fair premiums making zero expected proﬁts. We
now proceed with the analysis of the case when users are premium
discriminated in monopoly markets.

A user not willing to invest in self-defense investments will pay a
ﬁne a over his premium. At equilibrium the following result needs to
hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user who invests
in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does not invest in
self-defense investments.

7In a recent paper [17], the authors have proposed cooperation amongst
users on their self-defense investment information, as a way to ensure social
welfare maximization of network users under a cyber-insurance setting. The
authors use the well known Coase Bargaining Theorem [20] to arrive at their
result. However, user cooperation can only be sustained only under restricted
network settings where all users work towards a common goal, e.g., system
performance maximization in a multicasting scenario.

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

described in the respective sections.

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

(cid:90) r

l = l(X = xm) =

f (θ)dθ = 1 − F (xm).

(1)

xm

dxm = −f (xm) < 0, implying the proportion of individuals
Thus, dl(xm)
without self-defense investments is strictly decreasing in xm as more
in self-defense with increasing
users ﬁnd it preferable to invest
marginal costs.

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

5In practice, for reliability purposes, it is possible to enforce compulsory
insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is
generally owned by a single entity providing application services to numerous
customers.

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

def ] = E[U 1

E[U 1

or
E[U 1

def ] = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x).
def ] ≥

A user would want to invest in loss prevention only if E[U 1

Deﬁne Ψ1(l(xm1 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), x) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), x)] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )].

When X = r, we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), r) = (1 − pd){U (w0 − r) − U (w0)} < 0,

(2)

(3)

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), 0) = pd(1 − qmax){U (w0) − U (w0 − r)} > 0.

(4)

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

0

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= A1 + B1 + C1 + D1,

(6)

where

A1 = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )]f (xm1 ),

B1 = E[U 1

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 6 can be written as

= F + C1 + D1,

(7)

where

F = {E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]}f (xm1 ).

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xeq1 )]−E[U 1

(5)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(8)

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

4

in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
In the case of imperfect prevention, when network
users do not have cyber-insurance protection, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense, xeq1. Users
facing protection costs below xeq1 invest in self-defense mechanisms,
whereas other users do not. This NE cost of self-defense does not
result in maximizing user social welfare in the network, i.e., i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 1 follows from the ﬁrst fundamental theorem in
welfare economics [13] which states that the network externalities
generated by user investments are not internalized (i.e., users do not
pay for externality beneﬁts), by the users for public goods such as
security measures, and results in the free-riding problem. Thus, risk -
averse users do not end up putting in optimal self-defense efforts, and
this results in sub-optimal network security, i.e., the average of the
sum of user risk probabilities (denoted as p(xm)), is not minimized.
With respect to the welfare of users, the ones who face a cost of
investment above the NE cost do not buy security products and are not
satisﬁed because they cannot defend themselves on being attacked.
The ones who do invest in security measures are better off but are
still susceptible to indirect risks. Security vendors like Symantec and
Microsoft make proﬁts as per their current security product market
scenario. The case of no insurance is currently the situation in Internet
security, apart from a few organizations that are insured.

IV. SCENARIO 2: MONOPOLY MARKETS

In this section we analyze a regulated monopolistic cyber-
insurance market under conditions of imperfect prevention (self-
protection does not guarantee risk removal). Here the term ‘regulated’
implies the role of the government to (i) ensure Internet users buy
compulsory cyber-insurance, (ii) enable insurers to adopt premium
discrimination amongst clients based on the user risk types , and (iii)
allow basic user security behavior monitoring by insurance agencies.
We divide this section in two parts: in the ﬁrst part we analyze
the case when there is no contract discrimination amongst clients.
In the second part we analyze the case with clients being contract
discriminated.

A. Case 1- No Contract Discrimination

The expected utility of a user who does not invest is self-defense

in Scenario 2 is given as

E[U 2

ndef ] = E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))] = pdU (w0−r+r−P )+(1−pd)Q2,
where Q2 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
2, and is given as
Q2 = q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − r + r − P ) + (1− q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − P 2
Here P (p, r) = (1 + λ)p · r = P 2
11 is the insurance premium that
a user in Scenario 2, Case 1, and not investing in security (hence
denoted as P 2
11), pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage
of his loss (hence the ‘−r+r’ term in U), and R = r is the risk faced
by the user. xm2 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 2.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-defense
mechanisms is given as

11).

def ] = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), x)] = U (w0 − x − P 2

E[U 2
12 = P (q(l(xm), r) = (1 + λ)q(l(xm)) · r is the insurance
where P 2

to his insurer. A user would want to invest in loss prevention only if

Deﬁne Ψ2(l(xm2 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), x) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), x)] − E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))].

When X = 0, we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), 0) = U (w0 − P 2

12) − U (w0 − P 2

11) > 0,

and at X = r we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), r) = U (w0 − r) − U (w0 − pdr) < 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

In most practical cases, Equations 11 and 12 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ2(·) and imply that Ψ2(·) is decreasing in x and
there exists xeq2  (0, r), such that

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xeq2 ) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xeq2 )]−E[U 2

ndef (l(xeq2 ))] = 0.

def ] ≥ E[U 2

(13)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution, xeq2, to E[U 2
ndef ] is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost of protection investment, and equals xm2,
the marginal cost of making self-defense investments in Scenario 2.
This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-defense is less than
xeq2 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and cyber-insurance,
whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically,
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

the expression for the Nash equilibrium can be

U (w0 − xeq2 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq2 ) · r),

(14)

which leads to a NE value given by

xeq2 = p(xeq2 ) · r.

(15)
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 2 as
SW2(xm2 ) and is evaluated to

The ﬁrst term of SW2(xm2 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents adopting self-defense, the second term denotes the sum
of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-defense
and buying only cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW2(xm2 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt2, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW2(xm2 )

(17)

where

G = {E[U 2

Here, the ﬁrst term of G in brackets is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xm2 ), C21 and D21 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists x = xsopt2 such dSW2(x)
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dx

xsopt2 = argmaxxSW2(x).

(18)

Substituting xeq2 for xm2 in Equation 17, and using Equation 13 we
get

dSW2(x)

dx

|x=xeq2 > 0.

(19)

This implies that xsopt2 > xeq2 and l(xsopt2 ) < l(xeq2 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem for Scenario 2, Case 1.
Theorem 2. Under compulsory monopolistic cyber-insurance, there
exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense,
xeq2. Users facing protection costs below xeq2 invest in self-defense
mechanisms, whereas other users only buy cyber-insurance. This NE
cost of self-defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare
in the network (i.e., the proportion of users not resorting to self-
defense mechanisms is higher in the Nash equilibrium than in the
welfare optimum.), and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users to
invest in self-defense mechanisms.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 2 is that externalities caused due to individual user
investment in security mechanisms are not internalized by the users,
and as a result social welfare is not maximized at Nash equilibrium.
The implications of the theorem are (i) cyber-insurance does not
incentivize network users to invest in self-defense mechanisms6, (ii)
cyber-insurance exacerbates the moral hazard problem, i.e., once
users buy insurance they do not spend as much in self-defense as
they would without it. This makes sense from an economic viewpoint
as users would loath to bear excessive cost in self-defense if there
is an alternative to canceling out risk albeit at an unfair premium,
i.e., premium greater than the fair amount, and (iii) cyber-insurance
might increase individual user utilities (as users get full coverage
of their losses) but does not positively contribute to the increase
of overall network security. As a result a regulator interested in
improving network security is not satisﬁed. These implications are
also mentioned by the authors in [15] for a competitive market setting.
Also note that since λ ≥ 0, the cyber-insurer makes non-negative
expected proﬁts. A security vendor does not satisfy its interests from
an existing cyber-insurance market, i.e., compared to Scenario 1, as
the sales of its products are going to go down.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with no
client contract discrimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e.,
the social welfare of users is not maximized at NE. This does not
help satisfy the interests of all the market stakeholders.

B. Case 2 - Contract Discrimination

In the previous section we saw and investigated why inspite
of mandating cyber-insurance on network users, a social welfare
maximum could not be reached. In this section we aim to improve
upon this drawback by allowing the insurer to premium discriminate
its clients, and keeping all other
factors the same as in the

6As an exception, cyber-insurance incentivizes self-defense investments of
users in the case when insurable and non-insurable risk co-exist together and
it is not easy for a user to distinguish between the two [18]. For example,
a hardware failure can be caused due to either a security lapse, or hardware
defect, and it is difﬁcult for a naive user to ﬁgure out the right reason for the
failure.

case without premium discrimination7. The rationale for client
discrimination is that users who take (do not
take) appropriate
self-defense actions reduce (increase)
their chances of getting
attacked as well as reduce (increase) other network users’ chances
of facing a loss. In order to differentiate between clients,
the
cyber-insurer imposes a ﬁne of amount a per user of high risk type,
and provides a rebate of amount b per user of low risk type. A user
is considered of high risk type if he does not invest in self-defense
mechanisms, and is considered of low risk type when he does
invest in the same. A user decides whether it wants to invest in
self-protection depending on the cost of investment and the provided
ﬁne/rebate. The sequence of the protocol between the insurer and
the clients can be seen as follows: Stage 1 - the insurer advertises
appropriate contracts to its clients that include the ﬁne/rebate values.
Stage 2 - the users simultaneously decide whether or not to invest
in self-defense based on the cost of investment and their signed
contract information, and Stage 3 - when a coverage claim is ﬁled
by clients, the cyber-insurer examines the claims and charges the
suitable rebate/ﬁne to each client based on whether his investment
amounts were above or below a particular threshold. Here we
assume that the cyber-insurer can observe or stochastically learn the
investment amounts of its clients after a claim is made.

Note that the premium differentiation approach is feasible only
in the case of monopolistic cyber-insurance markets or imperfect
competitive markets. In the case of perfectly competitive markets,
price competition will not allow insurers to discriminate amongst their
clients for commercial demand purposes and insurers will have to sell
contracts at absolute fair premiums making zero expected proﬁts. We
now proceed with the analysis of the case when users are premium
discriminated in monopoly markets.

A user not willing to invest in self-defense investments will pay a
ﬁne a over his premium. At equilibrium the following result needs to
hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user who invests
in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does not invest in
self-defense investments.

users on their self-defense investment information, as a way to ensure social
welfare maximization of network users under a cyber-insurance setting. The
authors use the well known Coase Bargaining Theorem [20] to arrive at their
result. However, user cooperation can only be sustained only under restricted
network settings where all users work towards a common goal, e.g., system
performance maximization in a multicasting scenario.

social welfare is given as A22 = B22. Substituting x = xsopt2(cid:48) , and
a = asopt2(cid:48) in Equation 20, we get

U (w0 − xsopt2(cid:48) − P 2

21 + asopt2(cid:48) )),

Thus the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by charging high risk type
users a ﬁne of a on top of their premiums.

A user willing to invest in self-defense investments will receive
a rebate of b on his premium. At equilibrium the following result
needs to hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user
who invests in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does
not invest in self-defense investments:

U (w0 − x − (P 2

22 − b)) = U (w0 − P 2

(22)
Our goal here again is to ﬁnd the optimal self-defense cost xsopt2(cid:48)
that achieves maximum social welfare. Substituting x = xsopt2(cid:48) , and
b = bsopt2(cid:48) in Equation 22, we get

Then bsopt2(cid:48) is such that it satisﬁes the following condition (derived
by combining Equations 20 and 22.):

M = B22.

Thus, the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by providing low risk type
users with a rebate of b on their premiums.

The net minimum proﬁt made by a cyber-insurer per contract
(without any loading, λ, with loading the net proﬁt is even more.) in
a monopoly market with contract discrimination is given as
Πmonopoly = a · l(xsopt2(cid:48) − b · (1 − l(xsopt2(cid:48) )) ≥ 0.

(24)
The analysis above proves the following theorem on Scenario 2,
Case 2.
Theorem 3. Under conditions of compulsory monopolistic cyber-
insurance, a cyber-insurer can help achieve social welfare maximiza-
tion by premium discriminating clients. In turn, it makes non-negative
expected proﬁts, and also incentivizes users to invest in self-defense
investments.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: By premium
discriminating clients in the form of ﬁnes and rebates, cyber-insurers
guide risk-averse users to internalize the externalities caused by user
peers, and as a result help users invest in optimal self-defense amounts
that lead to social welfare maximization. The problem of moral
hazard in mitigated and as a result the overall network security is
optimal, which would please security regulatory bodies. Regarding
proﬁts, cyber-insurers make non-negative expected proﬁts8, and se-
curity product vendors would see an increase in their product sales
(and subsequently proﬁts) due to users being incentivized to invest
appropriate amounts in self-defense mechanisms.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with
client contract discrimination, there may exist an efﬁcient market
(always exists if λ > 0) that helps satisfy the interests of all the
market stakeholders.

8Note that in most cases the cyber-insurer would set λ values to be positive,

which implies strictly positive expected proﬁts.

V. SCENARIO 3: COMPETITIVE MARKETS

We assume a perfectly competitive cyber-insurance market9 where
multiple cyber-insurers provide their clients with full coverage at fair
premiums10. Due to imperfect prevention, we also assume that a
risk-averse user resorts to insurance solutions whenever he invests
in self-defense mechanisms. The expected utility of a user who does
not invest in self-defense mechanisms in Scenario 3 and only buys
insurance is given as

E[U 3

ndef ] = E[U 3

ndef (l(xm3 )] = pdU (w0−r+r−P 3

where Q3 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
3 and is given as

defense mechanisms is given as

self-defense investments in Scenario 3, i.e., the cost of investment
to a user indifferent between making and not making self-defense
investments. This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-
defense is less than xeq3 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and
cyber-insurance, whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically, the expression for the Walrasian equilibrium can be
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

U (w0 − xeq3 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq3 · r),
which leads to a Walrasian equilibrium value given by

xeq3 = p(xeq3 ) · r.

9Later in this section, we will comment on contract pricing in non-perfect

competitive (oligopolistic) markets.

10Note that under perfect competition, the equilibrium strategy for all ﬁrms
in a market is to charge fair premiums [13]. Charging unfair premiums will
result in a ﬁrm having zero demand.

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

described in the respective sections.

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

LIST OF IMPORTANT SYMBOLS

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

5In practice, for reliability purposes, it is possible to enforce compulsory
insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is
generally owned by a single entity providing application services to numerous
customers.

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

def ] = E[U 1

E[U 1

or
E[U 1

def ] = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x).
def ] ≥

A user would want to invest in loss prevention only if E[U 1

Deﬁne Ψ1(l(xm1 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), x) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), x)] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )].

When X = r, we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), r) = (1 − pd){U (w0 − r) − U (w0)} < 0,

(2)

(3)

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), 0) = pd(1 − qmax){U (w0) − U (w0 − r)} > 0.

(4)

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

0

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= A1 + B1 + C1 + D1,

(6)

where

A1 = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )]f (xm1 ),

B1 = E[U 1

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 6 can be written as

= F + C1 + D1,

(7)

where

F = {E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]}f (xm1 ).

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xeq1 )]−E[U 1

(5)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(8)

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

4

in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
In the case of imperfect prevention, when network
users do not have cyber-insurance protection, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense, xeq1. Users
facing protection costs below xeq1 invest in self-defense mechanisms,
whereas other users do not. This NE cost of self-defense does not
result in maximizing user social welfare in the network, i.e., i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 1 follows from the ﬁrst fundamental theorem in
welfare economics [13] which states that the network externalities
generated by user investments are not internalized (i.e., users do not
pay for externality beneﬁts), by the users for public goods such as
security measures, and results in the free-riding problem. Thus, risk -
averse users do not end up putting in optimal self-defense efforts, and
this results in sub-optimal network security, i.e., the average of the
sum of user risk probabilities (denoted as p(xm)), is not minimized.
With respect to the welfare of users, the ones who face a cost of
investment above the NE cost do not buy security products and are not
satisﬁed because they cannot defend themselves on being attacked.
The ones who do invest in security measures are better off but are
still susceptible to indirect risks. Security vendors like Symantec and
Microsoft make proﬁts as per their current security product market
scenario. The case of no insurance is currently the situation in Internet
security, apart from a few organizations that are insured.

IV. SCENARIO 2: MONOPOLY MARKETS

In this section we analyze a regulated monopolistic cyber-
insurance market under conditions of imperfect prevention (self-
protection does not guarantee risk removal). Here the term ‘regulated’
implies the role of the government to (i) ensure Internet users buy
compulsory cyber-insurance, (ii) enable insurers to adopt premium
discrimination amongst clients based on the user risk types , and (iii)
allow basic user security behavior monitoring by insurance agencies.
We divide this section in two parts: in the ﬁrst part we analyze
the case when there is no contract discrimination amongst clients.
In the second part we analyze the case with clients being contract
discriminated.

A. Case 1- No Contract Discrimination

The expected utility of a user who does not invest is self-defense

in Scenario 2 is given as

E[U 2

ndef ] = E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))] = pdU (w0−r+r−P )+(1−pd)Q2,
where Q2 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
2, and is given as
Q2 = q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − r + r − P ) + (1− q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − P 2
Here P (p, r) = (1 + λ)p · r = P 2
11 is the insurance premium that
a user in Scenario 2, Case 1, and not investing in security (hence
denoted as P 2
11), pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage
of his loss (hence the ‘−r+r’ term in U), and R = r is the risk faced
by the user. xm2 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 2.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-defense
mechanisms is given as

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), x) = E[U 2

When X = 0, we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), 0) = U (w0 − P 2

12) − U (w0 − P 2

11) > 0,

and at X = r we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), r) = U (w0 − r) − U (w0 − pdr) < 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

In most practical cases, Equations 11 and 12 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ2(·) and imply that Ψ2(·) is decreasing in x and
there exists xeq2  (0, r), such that

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xeq2 ) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xeq2 )]−E[U 2

ndef (l(xeq2 ))] = 0.

def ] ≥ E[U 2

(13)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution, xeq2, to E[U 2
ndef ] is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost of protection investment, and equals xm2,
the marginal cost of making self-defense investments in Scenario 2.
This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-defense is less than
xeq2 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and cyber-insurance,
whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically,
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

the expression for the Nash equilibrium can be

U (w0 − xeq2 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq2 ) · r),

(14)

which leads to a NE value given by

xeq2 = p(xeq2 ) · r.

(15)
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 2 as
SW2(xm2 ) and is evaluated to

(cid:90) ∞

The ﬁrst term of SW2(xm2 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents adopting self-defense, the second term denotes the sum
of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-defense
and buying only cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW2(xm2 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt2, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW2(xm2 )

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 16 can be written as

(17)

where

G = {E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xm2 )] − EU 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))}f (xm2 )

Here, the ﬁrst term of G in brackets is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xm2 ), C21 and D21 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists x = xsopt2 such dSW2(x)
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dx

xsopt2 = argmaxxSW2(x).

(18)

Substituting xeq2 for xm2 in Equation 17, and using Equation 13 we
get

dSW2(x)

dx

|x=xeq2 > 0.

(19)

This implies that xsopt2 > xeq2 and l(xsopt2 ) < l(xeq2 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem for Scenario 2, Case 1.
Theorem 2. Under compulsory monopolistic cyber-insurance, there
exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense,
xeq2. Users facing protection costs below xeq2 invest in self-defense
mechanisms, whereas other users only buy cyber-insurance. This NE
cost of self-defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare
in the network (i.e., the proportion of users not resorting to self-
defense mechanisms is higher in the Nash equilibrium than in the
welfare optimum.), and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users to
invest in self-defense mechanisms.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 2 is that externalities caused due to individual user
investment in security mechanisms are not internalized by the users,
and as a result social welfare is not maximized at Nash equilibrium.
The implications of the theorem are (i) cyber-insurance does not
incentivize network users to invest in self-defense mechanisms6, (ii)
cyber-insurance exacerbates the moral hazard problem, i.e., once
users buy insurance they do not spend as much in self-defense as
they would without it. This makes sense from an economic viewpoint
as users would loath to bear excessive cost in self-defense if there
is an alternative to canceling out risk albeit at an unfair premium,
i.e., premium greater than the fair amount, and (iii) cyber-insurance
might increase individual user utilities (as users get full coverage
of their losses) but does not positively contribute to the increase
of overall network security. As a result a regulator interested in
improving network security is not satisﬁed. These implications are
also mentioned by the authors in [15] for a competitive market setting.
Also note that since λ ≥ 0, the cyber-insurer makes non-negative
expected proﬁts. A security vendor does not satisfy its interests from
an existing cyber-insurance market, i.e., compared to Scenario 1, as
the sales of its products are going to go down.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with no
client contract discrimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e.,
the social welfare of users is not maximized at NE. This does not
help satisfy the interests of all the market stakeholders.

B. Case 2 - Contract Discrimination

In the previous section we saw and investigated why inspite
of mandating cyber-insurance on network users, a social welfare
maximum could not be reached. In this section we aim to improve
upon this drawback by allowing the insurer to premium discriminate
its clients, and keeping all other
factors the same as in the

6As an exception, cyber-insurance incentivizes self-defense investments of
users in the case when insurable and non-insurable risk co-exist together and
it is not easy for a user to distinguish between the two [18]. For example,
a hardware failure can be caused due to either a security lapse, or hardware
defect, and it is difﬁcult for a naive user to ﬁgure out the right reason for the
failure.

case without premium discrimination7. The rationale for client
discrimination is that users who take (do not
take) appropriate
self-defense actions reduce (increase)
their chances of getting
attacked as well as reduce (increase) other network users’ chances
of facing a loss. In order to differentiate between clients,
the
cyber-insurer imposes a ﬁne of amount a per user of high risk type,
and provides a rebate of amount b per user of low risk type. A user
is considered of high risk type if he does not invest in self-defense
mechanisms, and is considered of low risk type when he does
invest in the same. A user decides whether it wants to invest in
self-protection depending on the cost of investment and the provided
ﬁne/rebate. The sequence of the protocol between the insurer and
the clients can be seen as follows: Stage 1 - the insurer advertises
appropriate contracts to its clients that include the ﬁne/rebate values.
Stage 2 - the users simultaneously decide whether or not to invest
in self-defense based on the cost of investment and their signed
contract information, and Stage 3 - when a coverage claim is ﬁled
by clients, the cyber-insurer examines the claims and charges the
suitable rebate/ﬁne to each client based on whether his investment
amounts were above or below a particular threshold. Here we
assume that the cyber-insurer can observe or stochastically learn the
investment amounts of its clients after a claim is made.

Note that the premium differentiation approach is feasible only
in the case of monopolistic cyber-insurance markets or imperfect
competitive markets. In the case of perfectly competitive markets,
price competition will not allow insurers to discriminate amongst their
clients for commercial demand purposes and insurers will have to sell
contracts at absolute fair premiums making zero expected proﬁts. We
now proceed with the analysis of the case when users are premium
discriminated in monopoly markets.

A user not willing to invest in self-defense investments will pay a
ﬁne a over his premium. At equilibrium the following result needs to
hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user who invests
in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does not invest in
self-defense investments.

7In a recent paper [17], the authors have proposed cooperation amongst
users on their self-defense investment information, as a way to ensure social
welfare maximization of network users under a cyber-insurance setting. The
authors use the well known Coase Bargaining Theorem [20] to arrive at their
result. However, user cooperation can only be sustained only under restricted
network settings where all users work towards a common goal, e.g., system
performance maximization in a multicasting scenario.

social welfare is given as A22 = B22. Substituting x = xsopt2(cid:48) , and
a = asopt2(cid:48) in Equation 20, we get

U (w0 − xsopt2(cid:48) − P 2

22) = U (w0 − (P 2

21 + asopt2(cid:48) )),

Thus the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by charging high risk type
users a ﬁne of a on top of their premiums.

A user willing to invest in self-defense investments will receive
a rebate of b on his premium. At equilibrium the following result
needs to hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user
who invests in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does
not invest in self-defense investments:

U (w0 − x − (P 2

Our goal here again is to ﬁnd the optimal self-defense cost xsopt2(cid:48)

Then bsopt2(cid:48) is such that it satisﬁes the following condition (derived
by combining Equations 20 and 22.):

M = B22.

Thus, the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by providing low risk type
users with a rebate of b on their premiums.

The net minimum proﬁt made by a cyber-insurer per contract
(without any loading, λ, with loading the net proﬁt is even more.) in
a monopoly market with contract discrimination is given as
Πmonopoly = a · l(xsopt2(cid:48) − b · (1 − l(xsopt2(cid:48) )) ≥ 0.

(24)
The analysis above proves the following theorem on Scenario 2,
Case 2.
Theorem 3. Under conditions of compulsory monopolistic cyber-
insurance, a cyber-insurer can help achieve social welfare maximiza-
tion by premium discriminating clients. In turn, it makes non-negative
expected proﬁts, and also incentivizes users to invest in self-defense
investments.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: By premium
discriminating clients in the form of ﬁnes and rebates, cyber-insurers
guide risk-averse users to internalize the externalities caused by user
peers, and as a result help users invest in optimal self-defense amounts
that lead to social welfare maximization. The problem of moral
hazard in mitigated and as a result the overall network security is
optimal, which would please security regulatory bodies. Regarding
proﬁts, cyber-insurers make non-negative expected proﬁts8, and se-
curity product vendors would see an increase in their product sales
(and subsequently proﬁts) due to users being incentivized to invest
appropriate amounts in self-defense mechanisms.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with
client contract discrimination, there may exist an efﬁcient market
(always exists if λ > 0) that helps satisfy the interests of all the
market stakeholders.

8Note that in most cases the cyber-insurer would set λ values to be positive,

which implies strictly positive expected proﬁts.

V. SCENARIO 3: COMPETITIVE MARKETS

We assume a perfectly competitive cyber-insurance market9 where
multiple cyber-insurers provide their clients with full coverage at fair
premiums10. Due to imperfect prevention, we also assume that a
risk-averse user resorts to insurance solutions whenever he invests
in self-defense mechanisms. The expected utility of a user who does
not invest in self-defense mechanisms in Scenario 3 and only buys
insurance is given as

E[U 3

ndef ] = E[U 3

ndef (l(xm3 )] = pdU (w0−r+r−P 3

where Q3 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
3 and is given as

self-defense, pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage of
his loss. Here xm3 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 3.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-

defense mechanisms is given as

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ3(l(xm3 ), 0) = p{U (w0 − P 3

1 )} > 0.

(27)

In most practical cases, Equations 26 and 27 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ3(·) and imply that there exists an interior solution
xeq3, where 0 < xeq3 < P 3

Ψ3(l(xm3 ), xeq3 ) = E[U 3

Walrasian equilibrium [13] for perfectly competitive markets) cost of
protection investment, and equals xm3, the marginal cost of making
self-defense investments in Scenario 3, i.e., the cost of investment
to a user indifferent between making and not making self-defense
investments. This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-
defense is less than xeq3 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and
cyber-insurance, whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically, the expression for the Walrasian equilibrium can be
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

U (w0 − xeq3 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq3 · r),
which leads to a Walrasian equilibrium value given by

xeq3 = p(xeq3 ) · r.

9Later in this section, we will comment on contract pricing in non-perfect

competitive (oligopolistic) markets.

10Note that under perfect competition, the equilibrium strategy for all ﬁrms
in a market is to charge fair premiums [13]. Charging unfair premiums will
result in a ﬁrm having zero demand.

Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 3 as
SW3(xm3 ) and it is evaluated to

E[U 3

def (l(xm3 ), x)]f (x)dx + E[U 3

ndef (xm3 )] · l(xm3 ).

0

The ﬁrst term of SW3(xm3 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense and buying cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW3(xm3 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt3, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW3(xm3 )

dx

= A3 + B3 + C3 + D3,

(29)

where

A3 = E[U 3

In light of Equation 1, Equation 29 can be written as

dSW3(xm3 )

= N + C3 + D3,

(30)

where

N = {E[U 3

def (l(xm3 ), xm3 )] − E[U 3

ndef (xm3 )]}f (xm3 ).

Here, the ﬁrst term in brackets in N is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ3(l(xm3 ), xm3 ), C3 and D3 are non-negative and non-decreasing in
x. Since excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and negative
is zero, and
at x = P 3
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

1 , there exists x = xsopt3 such dSW3(x)

dx

xsopt3 = argmaxxm SW3(xm3 ).

(31)

Substituting xeq3 in Equation 31, and using Equation 28 we get

dSW3(x)

dx

|x=xeq3 > 0.

(32)

This implies that xsopt3 > xeq3 and l(xsopt3 ) < l(xeq3 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem on Scenario 3.
Theorem 4. When network users have the option of cyber-insurance
protection, there exists a unique Walrasian equilibrium cost to invest
in self-defense, xeq3. Users facing protection costs below xeq3 jointly
invest in self-defense mechanisms and insurance, whereas other users
only buy cyber-insurance. This Walrasian equilibrium cost of self-
defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare in the
network and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users into making
self-defense investments. In addition, the insurers make zero expected
proﬁts.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition and
implications behind Theorem 4 are exactly similar to that of Theorem
2. The intuition for a cyber-insurer in the perfectly competitive setting
to charge actuarially fair premiums is that adverse selection cannot

induce users to pay a premium loading as other insurers can undercut
the demanded price by ignoring externalities. Thus, the externalities
in a competitive cyber-insurance market cannot be internalized. So it
makes sense that the greater the amount of externalities in a network,
the more it makes sense to enforce a monopolistic cyber-insurance
market with client contract discrimination.
Central Point: Like in Scenario 2,
in a competitive (perfect or
oligopolistic) cyber-insurance scenario with no client contract dis-
crimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e., the social welfare
is not maximized at market equilibrium, and this does not help satisfy
the interests of all the market stakeholders.

A Note on Oligopolistic Markets: Oligopolistic markets resemble
imperfect (not perfectly competitive) competition between ﬁrms in a
market. In these markets, for a cyber-insurance setting, the insurers
have market power to set prices unlike in the perfect competition case,
where each insurer is price taking (has no market power to charge
actuarially unfair premiums) and can only charge actuarially fair
premiums to its clients. However, due to Bertrand’s paradox [13], for
number of insurers equal to two, the insurers ﬁnd it optimal to charge
fair premiums to their clients. So does that mean that in competitive
settings, cyber-insurers will always make zero expected proﬁts (due
to charging actuarially fair premiums to clients) ? The answer is no
because in reality factors such as ﬁrm popularity and customer lock-in
will result in some insurers charging unfair premiums to their clients
and making strictly positive expected proﬁts, without having to worry
about their client demands decreasing. In the case when the number
of cyber-insurance ﬁrms in a market are greater than two, the authors
in [15] show there exists a market Nash equilibrium which does not
maximize social welfare.
A comparative study of the three scenarios analyzed in the paper is
shown in Figure 1.

VI. RELATED WORK

In this section, we give an overview of related work on cyber-

insurance as applicable to this paper.

The ﬁeld of cyber-insurance in networked environments has been
triggered by recent results on the amount of self-defense investments
users should expend in the presence of network externalities in order
to ensure a robust cyber-space. The authors in [6][7][10] [11][14][16]
mathematically show that Internet users invest
too little in self-
defense mechanisms relative to the socially efﬁcient level, due to
the presence of network externalities. These works highlight the role
of positive externalities in preventing users from investing optimally

Abstract—Recent work in security has illustrated that solutions
aimed at detection and elimination of security threats alone
are unlikely to result in a robust cyberspace. As an orthogonal
approach to mitigating security problems, some have pursued the
use of cyber-insurance as a suitable risk management technique.
Such an approach has the potential to jointly align with the
incentives of security vendors (e.g., Symantec, Microsoft, etc.),
cyber-insurers (e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors,
etc.), regulatory agencies (e.g., government), and network users
(individuals and organizations),
in turn paving the way for
comprehensive and robust cyber-security mechanisms.

To this end, in this work, we are motivated by the following im-
portant question: can cyber-insurance really improve the security
in a network? To address this question, we adopt a market-based
approach. Speciﬁcally, we analyze regulated monopolistic and
competitive cyber-insurance markets, where the market elements
consist of risk-averse cyber-insurers, risk-averse network users,
a regulatory agency, and security vendors. Our results show that
(i) without contract discrimination amongst users, there always
exists a unique market equilibrium for both market types, but the
equilibrium is inefﬁcient and does not improve network security,
and (ii) in monopoly markets, contract discrimination amongst
users results in a unique market equilibrium that is efﬁcient,
which in turn results in network security improvement - however,
the cyber-insurer can make zero expected proﬁts. The latter fact
is often sufﬁcient to de-incentivize the insurer to be a part of
a market, and will eventually lead to its collapse. This fact also
emphasizes the need for designing mechanisms that incentivize
the insurer to permanently be part of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION

The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer
networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by
threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions
of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses,
spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by the threats, network
users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam softwares,
ﬁrewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to
reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a
large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as
considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing
and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies
in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the
negative impact of the anomalies.

Inspite of improvements in risk protection techniques over the
last decade due to hardware, software and cryptographic method-
ologies,
is impossible to achieve a perfect/near-perfect cyber-
security protection [3][12]. The impossibility arises due to a number
of reasons: (i) scarce existence of sound technical solutions, (ii)
difﬁculty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind
network attacks, (iii) misaligned incentives between network users,

it

security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding each
taking appropriate liabilities to protect the network, (iv) network
users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by
other user investments in security, in turn themselves not investing in
security and resulting in the free-riding problem, (v) customer lock-in
and ﬁrst mover effects of vulnerable security products, (vi) difﬁculty
to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk
removal solutions, (vii) the problem of a lemons market [2], whereby
security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the
market, (viii) liability shell games played by product vendors, and (ix)
user naiveness in optimally exploiting feature beneﬁts of technical
solutions. In view of the above mentioned inevitable barriers to near
100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods of risk
management in cyberspace 1. In this regard, some security researchers
in the recent past have identiﬁed cyber-insurance as a potential tool
for effective risk management.

traditional

insurance organizations),

Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which net-
work user risks are transferred to an insurance company (e.g., ISP,
cloud provider,
in return for
a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Proponents of cyber-insurance
believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance
contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability
on the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here
the term ‘self-defense’ implies the efforts by a network user to
secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus
and anti-spam softwares, ﬁrewalls, using secure operating systems,
etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution
that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (indi-
viduals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors,
i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn proﬁt from appropriately pricing
premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly
buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, the policy
makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the
security software vendors could go ahead with their ﬁrst-mover and
lock-in strategies as well as experience an increase in their product
sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.

A. Research Motivation

Despite all promises, current cyber-insurance markets are mod-
erately competitive and specialized. As of 2010, there are approx-
imately 18 insurance organizations in the United states insuring
$800 million worth of organizational IT resources only [4], and
there is little information as to whether the current cyber-insurance
market improves network security by incentivizing organizations to
invest aptly in security solutions. The inability of cyber-insurance
to become a common reality (i.e., to form a successful market)
amongst non-organizational individual users is due to a number of
unresolved research challenges as well as practical considerations.

1To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-
security, US President Barack Obama has recently passed a security bill that
emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them.

The most prominent amongst them is information asymmetry between
the insurer and the insured, and the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks [5].

i.e.,

Information asymmetry has a signiﬁcant negative effect on most
insurance environments, where typical considerations include inabil-
ity to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk)
the so called adverse selection problem, as well as
types,
users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after
the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so called moral hazard
problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated
nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates
traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the
former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span
a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in
security to counter risks generate positive externalities (See Section
I-C) for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here
is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the
network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions,
thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In
traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes
it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing
the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much
easier.

In this paper we investigate the following important question: can
cyber-insurance solutions induce efﬁcient markets that improve the
security of a network? By the term network security we imply the
average probability of a user being successfully attacked by malicious
threats [15]. This is our security metric. In the process of studying
improvement and the optimality of network security, we are interested
in analyzing the welfare of elements (stakeholders) that form a cyber-
insurance market (if there exists one).

B. Research Contributions

We make the following primary research contributions in this

paper.

• We propose a supply-demand model of

regulated cyber-
insurance markets that accounts for inter-dependent risks in a
networked environment as well as the externalities generated by
user security investments. (See Section II.)

• We show that a monopoly cyber-insurer providing full coverage
to its clients without contract discriminating them enables the
existence of an inefﬁcient cyber-insurance market that does
not improve network security. However, with client contract
discrimination, the cyber-insurer is successful in enabling an
efﬁcient cyber-insurance market that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and improves network security. In the process the
insurer makes non-negative expected proﬁts. (See Section IV.)
• We show that in perfectly competitive and oligopolistic cyber-
insurance settings, there exists an inefﬁcient insurance market
that does not improve network security. (See Section V.)

C. Basic Economics Concepts

In this section we brieﬂy review some basic economics concepts
as applicable to this work in order to establish terminology for
the remainder of the paper. Additional details could be found in a
standard economics textbook such as [13]. Basic concepts related to
insurance economics will be discussed in Section II.

externality: An externality is an effect (positive or negative) of a
purchase of self-defense investments by a set of users (individuals or
organizations) on other users whose interests were not taken into
account while making the investments. In this work,
the effects
are improvements in individual security of network users who are
connected to the users investing in self-defense.

risk probability: It is the probability of a network user being
successfully attacked by a cyber-threat and incurring a loss of a
particular amount.

initial wealth: It is the initial amount of wealth a network user
possesses before expending in any self-defense mechanisms and/or
insurance solutions.

user risk propensity: A risk-neutral investor (either the insurer
or the insured) is more concerned about the expected return on his
investment, not on the risk he may be taking on. A classic experiment
to distinguish between risk-taking appetites involves an investor faced
with a choice between receiving, say, either $100 with 100% certainty,
or a 50% chance of getting $200. The risk-neutral investor in this
case would have no preference either way, since the expected value
of $100 is the same for both outcomes. In contrast, the risk-averse
investor would generally settle for the ”sure thing” or 100% certain
$100, while the risk-seeking investor will opt for the 50% chance of
getting $200.

market: In regard to a cyber-insurance context, it is a platform
where cyber-insurance products are traded with insurance clients,
i.e.,
the network users. A market may be perfectly competitive,
oligopolistic, or monopolistic. In a perfectly competitive market there
exists a large number of buyers (those insured) and sellers (insurers)
that are small relative to the size of the overall market. The exact
number of buyers and sellers required for a competitive market is
not speciﬁed, but a competitive market has enough buyers and sellers
that no one buyer or seller can exert any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
premium pricing in the market. On the contrary, in monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets, the insurers have the power to set client
premiums to a certain liking.

equilibrium: An equilibrium refers to a situation when both,
buyers, as well as the sellers are satisﬁed with their net utilities
and no one has any incentive to deviate on their strategies. In this
paper we consider two equilibrium concepts: (i) the Nash equilibrium
(for monopoly markets and imperfectly competitive markets), and (ii)
the Walrasian equilibrium (a standard solution concept for perfectly
competitive markets).

stakeholders: The stakeholders in a cyber-insurance market refer
to entities whose interests are affected by the dynamics of market
operation. In our work we assume that the entities are cyber-insurers
(e.g., ISPs, cloud providers, security vendors, traditional insurance
companies),
the network users, a regulatory agency such as the
government, and security vendors such as Symantec and Microsoft.
market efﬁciency: A cyber-insurance market is called efﬁcient
if the social welfare of all network users is maximized at
the
market equilibrium. The market is inefﬁcient if it fails to achieve
this condition. Here, ‘social welfare’ refers to the sum of the net
utilities of network users after investing in self-defense and/or cyber-
insurance.

II. SUPPLY-DEMAND MODEL

In this section we propose a supply-demand model of a cyber-
insurance market. The section has two parts: in the ﬁrst part we
describe our model from a demand (network user) perspective, in the
second part we describe our model from the supply (cyber-insurer)
perspective. Important notation2 used in the paper is summarized in
Table 1. Additional notation is explained when used in subsequent
sections.
A. Model from a Demand Perspective

We consider a communication network comprised of a continuum
of risk-averse users. Here we use the notion of ‘users’ as mentioned
in [5], where users are considered as atomic nodes (individuals,
organizations, enterprise, data center elements, etc.) in the network,
each controlling a possible collection of devices. The links between
the nodes need not necessarily be physical connections and could
also represent logical or social ties amongst the nodes. For example,
social engineering attacks are conducted on overlay networks. Each

user has initial wealth w0 and faces a risk of size r < w0 with
probability p, i.e., he either faces a risk of size r with probability p
or faces no risk with probability 1 − p. Here p is a function of the
proportion of users not investing in security measures (read on for a
more formal description.). Each risk-averse user has the standard von
Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility3, U (·)[13], that is a function of
his ﬁnal wealth, is twice continuously differentiable, increasing, and
strictly concave. Each user also incurs a cost x to invest in self-
defense mechanisms, which is drawn from a random variable X
having distribution function F and density function f, each deﬁned
over the support [0, r]. We deﬁne xm to be the marginal cost of
investing in self-defense mechanisms, i.e., it is the cost to a user
who is indifferent between investing and not investing in self-defense.
Such a user’s net utility on investment is the same as his net utility
on non-investment. From now on in the paper, we assume that such a
user always invests in self-defense. All other risk-averse users either
decide to invest or not invest in self-defense mechanisms, depending
on whether their cost of investment is lower or higher than xm.

We assume that a user does not completely avoid loss on self-
protection, i.e., self-protection is not perfect, and is subject to two
types of losses: direct and indirect. A direct loss to a user is caused
when it is directly attacked by a malicious entity (threat). An indirect
loss to a user is caused when it is indirectly affected by direct threats
to other users in the network. Let pd denote the probability of a
direct loss to a user. Let q(l) denote the probability of a user getting
indirectly affected by other network users, where l is the proportion
of users in the network not adopting self-defense (self-protection)
mechanisms, which in turn is a function of xm, i.e., the marginal cost
to a user indifferent to investing in self-defense investments. Thus,
q = q(l) = q(l(xm)). We have the following relationship between l
and xm:

(cid:90) r

l = l(X = xm) =

f (θ)dθ = 1 − F (xm).

(1)

xm

dxm = −f (xm) < 0, implying the proportion of individuals
Thus, dl(xm)
without self-defense investments is strictly decreasing in xm as more
in self-defense with increasing
users ﬁnd it preferable to invest
marginal costs.

Regarding the connection between q and l(xm), the higher the
value of l(xm), the greater is the value of q. Therefore we assume
q(cid:48)(l(xm)) > 0, and 0 ≤ q(l(xm)) ≤ qmax. Here qmax is the value
of the function q taken at an argument value of 1, and we assume that
q(0) = 0. The interpretation behind q is that if nobody invests in self-
defense, a user gets indirectly affected with probability qmax, and if
everyone invests in self-defense, the probability of indirect loss to a
user is zero. Note that xm is dependent on the investment of one’s
neighbors in the contact graph (our work assumes any general contact
graph), which in turn is dependent on the investment of neighbor’s
neighbors and so on. The events that a user incurs a direct loss and
an indirect loss are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
case when a user does not completely avoid loss on self-defense, we
assume that he has no direct loss on investing in self-protection but
incurs an indirect loss. In this case, his probability of facing a loss
on investing in self-protection is given as

p = p(xm) = q(l(xm)).

The probability of a user facing a loss when he does not invest in
self-defense mechanisms is given as
p = p(xm) = pd +q(l(xm))−pdq(l(xm)) = pd +(1−pd)q(l(xm)).

LIST OF IMPORTANT SYMBOLS

B. Model from a Supply Perspective

In this paper we consider regulated monopolistic and competitive
(both perfect and oligopolistic) cyber-insurance markets. A regulatory
agency is typically a governmental agency whose role is to ensure
(i) insurers make proﬁts under certain limits, and (ii) the network
security is improved. A cyber-insurer could be any combination of
an ISP, security product vendor, traditional insurance companies, and
security third parties. We assume that insurers are risk-averse and
provide full coverage to their clients (users), who must buy cyber-
insurance in the monopolistic case (not necessarily in the competitive
case). Mandatory insurance is considered as a regulator’s tool in
[12], but the ﬂip side to it is that it might be politically inviable or
difﬁcult to implement [5]. However, in a recent article [8], the authors
cite the need of the US government to impose mandates on ISPs to
increase cyber-security4. In this regard, we could also foresee the use
of compulsory cyber-insurance if it were to increase cyber-security5.
Another reason why compulsory insurance could be mandated is to
prevent high-risk users from adopting unsafe protection measures.
In a non-compulsory system, high risk users might opt out of
buying cyber-insurance knowing that they would have to pay high
premiums. This would imply that these users could adopt unsafe
security measures that result in negatively affecting cyber-security.
With insurance being made compulsory, high risk users would take
steps to protect their systems more in order to pay lesser premiums,
and hence positively affect cyber-security. We ensure full coverage
from the insurer side in return for clients committing to buy cyber-
insurance.

In a correlated and interdependent risk environment such as the
Internet, a cyber-insurer cannot afford to be risk-neutral as it could

4As a matter of fact, in [18], the authors show that when insurable and
non-insurable risks (for example those caused by hardware/software reliability
faults) co-exist together, even under conditions of no information asymmetry
between the monopolistic insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance needs to
be made mandatory for a market to exist. From a policy viewpoint, this seems
tough to implement, but as mentioned above, in the interest of cyber-security,
such measures might be adopted in the near future.

5In practice, for reliability purposes, it is possible to enforce compulsory
insurance in data center and enterprise networks where the network is
generally owned by a single entity providing application services to numerous
customers.

get bankrupt if the expected aggregate loss in a period is greater than
what it could afford to cover. We assume the risk-averse behavior of
the insurer by requiring it to hold safety capital. A safety capital is
the additional amount over the expected aggregate loss in a period
such that the probability of an insurer incurring of a loss of value
greater than the sum of the capital and expected aggregate loss in that
period does not exceed a particular threshold. The threshold value is
deﬁned by a regulator. The cost of holding safety capital is distributed
across the clients through the premiums charged to them. We assume
that the share of safety capital cost per client is less than his expected
risk value. Each client is charged a premium of (1 + λ)E(R), where
λ ≥ 0 is the loading factor per contract, and E(R) is the expected
loss value of the client. The loading factor resembles the amount of
proﬁt per contract the cyber-insurer is keen on making and/or the
share of the safety capital cost of each user. A premium is said to
be fair if its value equals E(R), and is unfair if its value is greater
than E(R).

III. SCENARIO 1: NO INSURANCE CASE

In this section we analyze the case when network users do not
have access to any form of insurance coverage. This case is useful
for the comparison of optimal user investments in security between
scenarios of no insurance coverage and those with coverage.

The expected utility of a user in Scenario 1 who does not invest

in self-defense mechanisms is given as

E[U 1

ndef ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))] = pdU (w0 − r) + (1 − pd)Q1,
where Q1 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
1 and is given as

Q1 = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0),

where q = q(l(xm1 )). Here, xm1 is the marginal cost of investment
in Scenario 1. Similarly, the expected utility of the same user when
he invests in self-defense mechanisms is given as
def (l(xm1 ), x)]

def ] = E[U 1

E[U 1

or
E[U 1

def ] = q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x − r) + (1 − q(l(xm1 ))U (w0 − x).
def ] ≥

A user would want to invest in loss prevention only if E[U 1
E[U 1
Deﬁne Ψ1(l(xm1 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), x) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), x)] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )].

When X = r, we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), r) = (1 − pd){U (w0 − r) − U (w0)} < 0,

(2)

(3)

and at X = 0 we have

Ψ1(l(xm1 ), 0) = pd(1 − qmax){U (w0) − U (w0 − r)} > 0.

(4)

xeq1, in the equation is the competitive Nash equilibrium (NE) cost
of protection investment. It implies the fact that users whose cost of
self-defense is less than xeq1 invest in self-defense as their expected
utilities of investing would be greater than that without it, whereas
the others do not invest in any protection mechanisms as it would
not be proﬁtable for them to do so. Mathematically, the expression
for the Nash equilibrium can be derived from the following equation
arising due to [19].
U (w0 − xeq1 − q(l(xeq1 ))· r− π[q(l(xeq1 )]) = U (w0 − p· r− π[p]),
where p = p(xeq1 ), which leads to a NE value given by

xeq1 = pd(1 − q(l(xeq1 )) · r − π[q(xeq1 )] + π[p(xeq1 )].

Here π[p] is the risk premium and denotes the maximum amount a
user is willing to pay to securely receive the expected value of the
probability distribution of risk instead of the probability distribution
itself.
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users in the no insurance case as the sum of the expected
utility of all the users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in
Scenario 1 as SW1(xm1 ) and express it as

(cid:90) xm1

SW1(xm1 ) =

E[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]f (x)dx+E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 )]l(xm1 ).

0

The ﬁrst term in SW1(xm1 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense. Equating the ﬁrst order condition for SW1(xm1 ) results in
ﬁnding xsopt1, the cost of investment that maximizes social welfare.
The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= A1 + B1 + C1 + D1,

(6)

where

A1 = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )]f (xm1 ),

B1 = E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]

dl(xm1 )
dxm1

,

C1 =

(cid:90) xm1

and

D1 =

dE[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]
dxm1

l(xm1 ),

δE[U 1

def (l(xm1 , x)]

f (x)dx.

0

δxm1

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 6 can be written as

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

= F + C1 + D1,

(7)

where

F = {E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xm1 )] − E[U 1

ndef (l(xm1 ))]}f (xm1 ).

In most practical cases, Equations 3 and 4 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ1(·) (due to Ψ being often strictly decreasing)
and imply that (i) if no user invests in self-protection and the risk of
loss is very high, it is worth to undertake defense measures to reduce
expected loss, when cost to invest in self-defense is zero, (ii) if every
user invests in self defense and the risk is zero, an investment is
not worth being undertaken, and (iii) there exists an interior solution
xeq1, where 0 < xeq1 < r, such that
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xeq1 ) = E[U 1

def (l(xm1 ), xeq1 )]−E[U 1

(5)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution to E[U 1
ndef ] gives us
the investment cost to a user who is indifferent between investing and
not investing in self-defense. Thus xeq1 = xm1, the marginal cost of
making self-defense investments in Scenario 1. The interior solution,

def ] = E[U 1

ndef (l(xeq1 ))] = 0.

The term inside brackets of F is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ1(l(xm1 ), xm1 ). C1 and D1 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists xsopt1 such dSW1(xm1 )
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dxm1

xsopt1 = argmaxxm1 SW1(xm1 ).

Substituting xeq1 in Equation 7, and using Equation 5 we get

dSW1(xm1 )

dxm1

|xm1 =xeq1 > 0.

(8)

(9)

This implies that xsopt1 > xeq1 and l(xsopt1 ) < l(xeq1 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher

4

in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem.
Theorem 1.
In the case of imperfect prevention, when network
users do not have cyber-insurance protection, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense, xeq1. Users
facing protection costs below xeq1 invest in self-defense mechanisms,
whereas other users do not. This NE cost of self-defense does not
result in maximizing user social welfare in the network, i.e., i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 1 follows from the ﬁrst fundamental theorem in
welfare economics [13] which states that the network externalities
generated by user investments are not internalized (i.e., users do not
pay for externality beneﬁts), by the users for public goods such as
security measures, and results in the free-riding problem. Thus, risk -
averse users do not end up putting in optimal self-defense efforts, and
this results in sub-optimal network security, i.e., the average of the
sum of user risk probabilities (denoted as p(xm)), is not minimized.
With respect to the welfare of users, the ones who face a cost of
investment above the NE cost do not buy security products and are not
satisﬁed because they cannot defend themselves on being attacked.
The ones who do invest in security measures are better off but are
still susceptible to indirect risks. Security vendors like Symantec and
Microsoft make proﬁts as per their current security product market
scenario. The case of no insurance is currently the situation in Internet
security, apart from a few organizations that are insured.

IV. SCENARIO 2: MONOPOLY MARKETS

In this section we analyze a regulated monopolistic cyber-
insurance market under conditions of imperfect prevention (self-
protection does not guarantee risk removal). Here the term ‘regulated’
implies the role of the government to (i) ensure Internet users buy
compulsory cyber-insurance, (ii) enable insurers to adopt premium
discrimination amongst clients based on the user risk types , and (iii)
allow basic user security behavior monitoring by insurance agencies.
We divide this section in two parts: in the ﬁrst part we analyze
the case when there is no contract discrimination amongst clients.
In the second part we analyze the case with clients being contract
discriminated.

A. Case 1- No Contract Discrimination

The expected utility of a user who does not invest is self-defense

in Scenario 2 is given as

E[U 2

ndef ] = E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))] = pdU (w0−r+r−P )+(1−pd)Q2,
where Q2 is the probability of the user facing indirect loss in Scenario
2, and is given as
Q2 = q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − r + r − P ) + (1− q(l(xm2 ))U (w0 − P 2
Here P (p, r) = (1 + λ)p · r = P 2
11 is the insurance premium that
a user in Scenario 2, Case 1, and not investing in security (hence
denoted as P 2
11), pays to his cyber-insurer in return for full coverage
of his loss (hence the ‘−r+r’ term in U), and R = r is the risk faced
by the user. xm2 is the marginal cost of investment in Scenario 2.
The expected utility of the same user when he invests in self-defense
mechanisms is given as

11).

def ] = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), x)] = U (w0 − x − P 2

E[U 2
12 = P (q(l(xm), r) = (1 + λ)q(l(xm)) · r is the insurance
where P 2

E[U 2
Deﬁne Ψ2(l(xm2 ), X = x) as

ndef ].

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), x) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), x)] − E[U 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))].

When X = 0, we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), 0) = U (w0 − P 2

12) − U (w0 − P 2

11) > 0,

and at X = r we have

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), r) = U (w0 − r) − U (w0 − pdr) < 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

In most practical cases, Equations 11 and 12 jointly indicate the
monotonicity of Ψ2(·) and imply that Ψ2(·) is decreasing in x and
there exists xeq2  (0, r), such that

Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xeq2 ) = E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xeq2 )]−E[U 2

ndef (l(xeq2 ))] = 0.

def ] ≥ E[U 2

(13)
Nash Equilibrium: The solution, xeq2, to E[U 2
ndef ] is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) cost of protection investment, and equals xm2,
the marginal cost of making self-defense investments in Scenario 2.
This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-defense is less than
xeq2 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and cyber-insurance,
whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically,
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

the expression for the Nash equilibrium can be

U (w0 − xeq2 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq2 ) · r),

(14)

which leads to a NE value given by

xeq2 = p(xeq2 ) · r.

(15)
Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 2 as
SW2(xm2 ) and is evaluated to

(cid:90) ∞

(cid:90) xm2

ndef (xm2 )]l(xm2 ).

0
The ﬁrst term of SW2(xm2 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents adopting self-defense, the second term denotes the sum
of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-defense
and buying only cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW2(xm2 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt2, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW2(xm2 )

= A21 + B21 + C21 + D21,

(16)

where

In the light of Equation 1, Equation 16 can be written as

= G + C21 + D21,

(17)

where

G = {E[U 2

def (l(xm2 ), xm2 )] − EU 2

ndef (l(xm2 ))}f (xm2 )

Here, the ﬁrst term of G in brackets is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ2(l(xm2 ), xm2 ), C21 and D21 are non-negative and non-decreasing
in x. Since the excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and
negative at x = r, there exists x = xsopt2 such dSW2(x)
is zero, and
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

dx

xsopt2 = argmaxxSW2(x).

(18)

Substituting xeq2 for xm2 in Equation 17, and using Equation 13 we
get

dSW2(x)

dx

|x=xeq2 > 0.

(19)

This implies that xsopt2 > xeq2 and l(xsopt2 ) < l(xeq2 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem for Scenario 2, Case 1.
Theorem 2. Under compulsory monopolistic cyber-insurance, there
exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) cost to invest in self-defense,
xeq2. Users facing protection costs below xeq2 invest in self-defense
mechanisms, whereas other users only buy cyber-insurance. This NE
cost of self-defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare
in the network (i.e., the proportion of users not resorting to self-
defense mechanisms is higher in the Nash equilibrium than in the
welfare optimum.), and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users to
invest in self-defense mechanisms.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition
behind Theorem 2 is that externalities caused due to individual user
investment in security mechanisms are not internalized by the users,
and as a result social welfare is not maximized at Nash equilibrium.
The implications of the theorem are (i) cyber-insurance does not
incentivize network users to invest in self-defense mechanisms6, (ii)
cyber-insurance exacerbates the moral hazard problem, i.e., once
users buy insurance they do not spend as much in self-defense as
they would without it. This makes sense from an economic viewpoint
as users would loath to bear excessive cost in self-defense if there
is an alternative to canceling out risk albeit at an unfair premium,
i.e., premium greater than the fair amount, and (iii) cyber-insurance
might increase individual user utilities (as users get full coverage
of their losses) but does not positively contribute to the increase
of overall network security. As a result a regulator interested in
improving network security is not satisﬁed. These implications are
also mentioned by the authors in [15] for a competitive market setting.
Also note that since λ ≥ 0, the cyber-insurer makes non-negative
expected proﬁts. A security vendor does not satisfy its interests from
an existing cyber-insurance market, i.e., compared to Scenario 1, as
the sales of its products are going to go down.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with no
client contract discrimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e.,
the social welfare of users is not maximized at NE. This does not
help satisfy the interests of all the market stakeholders.

B. Case 2 - Contract Discrimination

In the previous section we saw and investigated why inspite
of mandating cyber-insurance on network users, a social welfare
maximum could not be reached. In this section we aim to improve
upon this drawback by allowing the insurer to premium discriminate
its clients, and keeping all other
factors the same as in the

6As an exception, cyber-insurance incentivizes self-defense investments of
users in the case when insurable and non-insurable risk co-exist together and
it is not easy for a user to distinguish between the two [18]. For example,
a hardware failure can be caused due to either a security lapse, or hardware
defect, and it is difﬁcult for a naive user to ﬁgure out the right reason for the
failure.

case without premium discrimination7. The rationale for client
discrimination is that users who take (do not
take) appropriate
self-defense actions reduce (increase)
their chances of getting
attacked as well as reduce (increase) other network users’ chances
of facing a loss. In order to differentiate between clients,
the
cyber-insurer imposes a ﬁne of amount a per user of high risk type,
and provides a rebate of amount b per user of low risk type. A user
is considered of high risk type if he does not invest in self-defense
mechanisms, and is considered of low risk type when he does
invest in the same. A user decides whether it wants to invest in
self-protection depending on the cost of investment and the provided
ﬁne/rebate. The sequence of the protocol between the insurer and
the clients can be seen as follows: Stage 1 - the insurer advertises
appropriate contracts to its clients that include the ﬁne/rebate values.
Stage 2 - the users simultaneously decide whether or not to invest
in self-defense based on the cost of investment and their signed
contract information, and Stage 3 - when a coverage claim is ﬁled
by clients, the cyber-insurer examines the claims and charges the
suitable rebate/ﬁne to each client based on whether his investment
amounts were above or below a particular threshold. Here we
assume that the cyber-insurer can observe or stochastically learn the
investment amounts of its clients after a claim is made.

Note that the premium differentiation approach is feasible only
in the case of monopolistic cyber-insurance markets or imperfect
competitive markets. In the case of perfectly competitive markets,
price competition will not allow insurers to discriminate amongst their
clients for commercial demand purposes and insurers will have to sell
contracts at absolute fair premiums making zero expected proﬁts. We
now proceed with the analysis of the case when users are premium
discriminated in monopoly markets.

A user not willing to invest in self-defense investments will pay a
ﬁne a over his premium. At equilibrium the following result needs to
hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user who invests
in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does not invest in
self-defense investments.

7In a recent paper [17], the authors have proposed cooperation amongst
users on their self-defense investment information, as a way to ensure social
welfare maximization of network users under a cyber-insurance setting. The
authors use the well known Coase Bargaining Theorem [20] to arrive at their
result. However, user cooperation can only be sustained only under restricted
network settings where all users work towards a common goal, e.g., system
performance maximization in a multicasting scenario.

social welfare is given as A22 = B22. Substituting x = xsopt2(cid:48) , and
a = asopt2(cid:48) in Equation 20, we get

U (w0 − xsopt2(cid:48) − P 2

22) = U (w0 − (P 2

21 + asopt2(cid:48) )),

(21)

where asopt2(cid:48) satisﬁes E = B22, where

U (w0 − (P 2

Thus the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by charging high risk type
users a ﬁne of a on top of their premiums.

A user willing to invest in self-defense investments will receive
a rebate of b on his premium. At equilibrium the following result
needs to hold for the cyber-insurer to treat equally (fairly), a user
who invests in self-defense investments, as well as a user who does
not invest in self-defense investments:

U (w0 − x − (P 2

22 − b)) = U (w0 − P 2

(22)
Our goal here again is to ﬁnd the optimal self-defense cost xsopt2(cid:48)
that achieves maximum social welfare. Substituting x = xsopt2(cid:48) , and
b = bsopt2(cid:48) in Equation 22, we get

21).

where P 2

22 − bsopt2(cid:48) ) = U (w0 − P 2

M = U (w0 − xsopt2(cid:48) − (P 2

22 − bsopt2(cid:48) )) − C22.

Then bsopt2(cid:48) is such that it satisﬁes the following condition (derived
by combining Equations 20 and 22.):

M = B22.

Thus, the optimal self-defense investment cost xsopt2(cid:48)
to achieve
social welfare maximization is obtained by providing low risk type
users with a rebate of b on their premiums.

The net minimum proﬁt made by a cyber-insurer per contract
(without any loading, λ, with loading the net proﬁt is even more.) in
a monopoly market with contract discrimination is given as
Πmonopoly = a · l(xsopt2(cid:48) − b · (1 − l(xsopt2(cid:48) )) ≥ 0.

(24)
The analysis above proves the following theorem on Scenario 2,
Case 2.
Theorem 3. Under conditions of compulsory monopolistic cyber-
insurance, a cyber-insurer can help achieve social welfare maximiza-
tion by premium discriminating clients. In turn, it makes non-negative
expected proﬁts, and also incentivizes users to invest in self-defense
investments.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: By premium
discriminating clients in the form of ﬁnes and rebates, cyber-insurers
guide risk-averse users to internalize the externalities caused by user
peers, and as a result help users invest in optimal self-defense amounts
that lead to social welfare maximization. The problem of moral
hazard in mitigated and as a result the overall network security is
optimal, which would please security regulatory bodies. Regarding
proﬁts, cyber-insurers make non-negative expected proﬁts8, and se-
curity product vendors would see an increase in their product sales
(and subsequently proﬁts) due to users being incentivized to invest
appropriate amounts in self-defense mechanisms.
Central Point: In the monopolistic cyber-insurance scenario with
client contract discrimination, there may exist an efﬁcient market
(always exists if λ > 0) that helps satisfy the interests of all the
market stakeholders.

8Note that in most cases the cyber-insurer would set λ values to be positive,

which implies strictly positive expected proﬁts.

V. SCENARIO 3: COMPETITIVE MARKETS

We assume a perfectly competitive cyber-insurance market9 where
multiple cyber-insurers provide their clients with full coverage at fair
premiums10. Due to imperfect prevention, we also assume that a
risk-averse user resorts to insurance solutions whenever he invests
in self-defense mechanisms. The expected utility of a user who does
not invest in self-defense mechanisms in Scenario 3 and only buys
insurance is given as

E[U 3
Walrasian equilibrium [13] for perfectly competitive markets) cost of
protection investment, and equals xm3, the marginal cost of making
self-defense investments in Scenario 3, i.e., the cost of investment
to a user indifferent between making and not making self-defense
investments. This implies the fact that users whose cost of self-
defense is less than xeq3 ﬁnd it proﬁtable to invest in self-defense and
cyber-insurance, whereas the others invest only in cyber-insurance.
Mathematically, the expression for the Walrasian equilibrium can be
derived from the following equation arising due to [19].

U (w0 − xeq3 ) = U (w0 − p(xeq3 · r),
which leads to a Walrasian equilibrium value given by

xeq3 = p(xeq3 ) · r.

9Later in this section, we will comment on contract pricing in non-perfect

competitive (oligopolistic) markets.

10Note that under perfect competition, the equilibrium strategy for all ﬁrms
in a market is to charge fair premiums [13]. Charging unfair premiums will
result in a ﬁrm having zero demand.

Social Welfare Maximization: We deﬁne the social welfare of a
network of users as the sum of the expected utility of all
the
users. Mathematically, we denote social welfare in Scenario 3 as
SW3(xm3 ) and it is evaluated to

E[U 3

def (l(xm3 ), x)]f (x)dx + E[U 3

ndef (xm3 )] · l(xm3 ).

0

The ﬁrst term of SW3(xm3 ) denotes the sum of the expected utility
of all agents with adopting self-defense, the second term denotes
the sum of the expected utilities of all agents not investing in self-
defense and buying cyber-insurance. Equating the ﬁrst order condition
for SW3(xm3 ) results in ﬁnding xsopt3, the cost of investment that
maximizes social welfare.

The ﬁrst order condition (FOC) for an interior maximum is

dSW3(xm3 )

dx

= A3 + B3 + C3 + D3,

(29)

where

A3 = E[U 3

In light of Equation 1, Equation 29 can be written as

= N + C3 + D3,

(30)

where

N = {E[U 3

def (l(xm3 ), xm3 )] − E[U 3

ndef (xm3 )]}f (xm3 ).

Here, the ﬁrst term in brackets in N is the excess of expected utility,
Ψ3(l(xm3 ), xm3 ), C3 and D3 are non-negative and non-decreasing in
x. Since excess of expected utility is positive at x = 0 and negative
is zero, and
at x = P 3
the social welfare in the network is maximized. We represent this
mathematically as

1 , there exists x = xsopt3 such dSW3(x)

dx

xsopt3 = argmaxxm SW3(xm3 ).

(31)

Substituting xeq3 in Equation 31, and using Equation 28 we get

dSW3(x)

dx

|x=xeq3 > 0.

(32)

This implies that xsopt3 > xeq3 and l(xsopt3 ) < l(xeq3 ). i.e., the
proportion of users not resorting to self-defense mechanisms is higher
in the Nash equilibrium than in the welfare optimum. The analysis
above proves the following theorem on Scenario 3.
Theorem 4. When network users have the option of cyber-insurance
protection, there exists a unique Walrasian equilibrium cost to invest
in self-defense, xeq3. Users facing protection costs below xeq3 jointly
invest in self-defense mechanisms and insurance, whereas other users
only buy cyber-insurance. This Walrasian equilibrium cost of self-
defense does not result in maximizing user social welfare in the
network and cyber-insurance does not incentivize users into making
self-defense investments. In addition, the insurers make zero expected
proﬁts.

Theorem Intuition and Practical Implications: The intuition and
implications behind Theorem 4 are exactly similar to that of Theorem
2. The intuition for a cyber-insurer in the perfectly competitive setting
to charge actuarially fair premiums is that adverse selection cannot

induce users to pay a premium loading as other insurers can undercut
the demanded price by ignoring externalities. Thus, the externalities
in a competitive cyber-insurance market cannot be internalized. So it
makes sense that the greater the amount of externalities in a network,
the more it makes sense to enforce a monopolistic cyber-insurance
market with client contract discrimination.
Central Point: Like in Scenario 2,
in a competitive (perfect or
oligopolistic) cyber-insurance scenario with no client contract dis-
crimination, there exists an inefﬁcient market, i.e., the social welfare
is not maximized at market equilibrium, and this does not help satisfy
the interests of all the market stakeholders.

A Note on Oligopolistic Markets: Oligopolistic markets resemble
imperfect (not perfectly competitive) competition between ﬁrms in a
market. In these markets, for a cyber-insurance setting, the insurers
have market power to set prices unlike in the perfect competition case,
where each insurer is price taking (has no market power to charge
actuarially unfair premiums) and can only charge actuarially fair
premiums to its clients. However, due to Bertrand’s paradox [13], for
number of insurers equal to two, the insurers ﬁnd it optimal to charge
fair premiums to their clients. So does that mean that in competitive
settings, cyber-insurers will always make zero expected proﬁts (due
to charging actuarially fair premiums to clients) ? The answer is no
because in reality factors such as ﬁrm popularity and customer lock-in
will result in some insurers charging unfair premiums to their clients
and making strictly positive expected proﬁts, without having to worry
about their client demands decreasing. In the case when the number
of cyber-insurance ﬁrms in a market are greater than two, the authors
in [15] show there exists a market Nash equilibrium which does not
maximize social welfare.
A comparative study of the three scenarios analyzed in the paper is
shown in Figure 1.

VI. RELATED WORK

In this section, we give an overview of related work on cyber-

insurance as applicable to this paper.

The ﬁeld of cyber-insurance in networked environments has been
triggered by recent results on the amount of self-defense investments
users should expend in the presence of network externalities in order
to ensure a robust cyber-space. The authors in [6][7][10] [11][14][16]
mathematically show that Internet users invest
too little in self-
defense mechanisms relative to the socially efﬁcient level, due to
the presence of network externalities. These works highlight the role
of positive externalities in preventing users from investing optimally

Thus, the challenge to improving overall
network security lies in incentivizing end-users to invest in sufﬁcient
amount of self-defense investments inspite of the positive externalities
they experience from other users investing in the network.

In response to the challenge,

the works in [10][11] modeled
network externalities and showed that a tipping phenomenon is
possible, i.e., in a situation of low level of self-defense, if a certain
fraction of population decides to invest in self-defense mechanisms, it
could trigger a large cascade of adoption in security features, thereby
strengthening the overall Internet security. However, they did not state
how the tipping phenomenon could be realized in practice.

In another set of recent works [9][12], Lelarge and Bolot have
stated that under conditions of no information asymmetry [1] between
the insurer and the insured, cyber-insurance incentivizes Internet user
investments in self-defense mechanisms, thereby paving the path to
trigger a cascade of adoption. They also show that investments in
both self-defense mechanisms and insurance schemes are quite inter-
related in maintaining a socially efﬁcient level of security on the
Internet. The authors in [21] follow up on the framework of Lelarge
et.al and mathematically show that insurance is an incentive to self-
defense investments only if the quality of self-defense is not very
good, and the initial security level of a user is poor. In a recent work
[17], the authors show that in a cyber-insurance framework similar
to the one proposed by Lelarge and Bolot, cooperation amongst
network users results in the latter making better (more) self-defense
investments than the case in which they would not cooperate. Thus,
the authors’ results reﬂect that cooperation amongst network users
will result in a more robust cyberspace. However, not all applications
in cyberspace can be cooperative and as a result we consider the
general case of non-cooperative application environments and to
ensure optimal insurance-driven self-defense amongst users in such
environments.

In another recent work [18], the authors derive Aegis, a novel opti-
mal insurance contract type based on the traditional cyber-insurance
model, in order to address the realistic scenario when both, insurable
and non-insurable risks co-exist in practice. They mathematically
show that (i) for any type of single-insurer cyber-insurance market
(whether offering Aegis type or traditional type contracts) to exist,
a necessary condition is to make insurance mandatory for all risk-
averse network users, (ii) Aegis contracts mandatorily shift more
liability on to network users to self-defend their own computing
systems, when compared to traditional cyber-insurance contracts,
and (iii) it is rational to prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-
insurance contracts when an option is available. However, the authors
do not analyze markets for cyber-insurance, where one needs to
consider as important goals, maximizing social welfare, and satisfying
multiple stake-holders. Without such considerations, simply shifting
liability on users to invest more may not be enough for a successful
cyber-insurance market.

Drawbacks: All of the above mentioned works conduct analysis
under the assumption of ideal insurance environments, i.e., when
there is no information asymmetry between the insurer and the
insured. These works also do not address the problem of ways
for cyber-insurers to always make strictly expected positive proﬁts,
without which the cyber-insurance business would not survive in the
long run. In addition the above works assume a risk-neutral cyber-
insurer. As mentioned previously, in a correlated risk environment
such as the Internet, the assumption of insurers being risk-neutral is
not a good one as the latter could become bankrupt. Thus, modeling
the insurer as being risk-averse is appropriate.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper we analyzed the existence and success of potential
cyber-insurance markets. We showed that without client contract dis-
crimination, cyber-insurers offering full insurance coverage can entail
the existence of markets, i.e., existence of a market equilibrium, but
cannot guarantee themselves of making strictly positive proﬁts. These

9

markets do not maximize the social welfare in a network, cannot help
alleviate the moral hazard problem, and result in sub-optimal network
security. Surely these markets will not be successful and stable in
the long run as it makes multiple stakeholders unsatisﬁed. In order
to overcome these issues we proposed client contract discrimination
on behalf of monopolistic insurers that alleviates the moral hazard
problem and entail markets that result in optimal network security.
However, the insurer is still not guaranteed to make strictly positive
proﬁts in these markets.

To alleviate this issue a security vendor can enter the cyber-
insurance ecosystem and via a symbiotic relationship between the
insurer (through exchange of logical/social client topological infor-
mation and lock-in privileges for proﬁt shares of the SV) can increase
its proﬁts and subsequently enable the cyber-insurer to always make
strictly positive proﬁts keeping the social welfare state identical. As
a special case the security vendor could be the cyber-insurer itself.
We plan to investigate the symbiotic relationship between security
vendors and cyber-insurers as part of future work.

One drawback of our work is we assume that an insurer can
stochastically observe user investment amounts and infer their risk
type. This partially incorporates the adverse selection problem in
the model. However, as part of future work we want to investigate
the existence of efﬁcient cyber-insurance markets when the insurer
can make no observations on client investments, or is given false
information by the clients. Another problem we want to explore is
to ﬁnd ways to satisfy all market stakeholders under non-compulsory
cyber-insurance.
