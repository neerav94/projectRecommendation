I.   INTRODUCTION 
Increasing lapses of cyber security in both defence, non-military networks, a growing threat of embedded malware, cyber 
attacks  from  inimical  elements  and  nations  has  brought  to  fore  the  immense  importance  of  network  security. 
Simultaneously, the proliferation of networks to a large population has increased network accessibility for a large section 
of  hackers  to  abuse,  which  is  finally  being  addressed  by  stronger  security  methods  such  as  advanced  encryption 
algorithms,  efficient  authentication  process  and  ‘defense  in  depth’  approach.  Every  network  administrator  ensures 
building adequate security measures at his level. Since all system administrators work in a disjoint manner and manage 
security solutions at different layers of OSI model, the global picture builds up a scenario, where the sender finds his data 
going through some encryption/security process at all levels starting from Application layer down to Physical layer and a 
decryption process at all layers at the receiver end. This paper makes a proposal to carry out performance analysis of the 
cumulative effect of employing security mechanisms at all layers of the network. 
 
II. MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY    
THE OPEN  SYSTEMS  INTERCONNECTION  (OSI)  MODEL AND  VULNERABILITIES  The Open  Systems 
Interconnection  (OSI)  model (ISO/IEC  7498-1)  is  a  conceptual  model that  characterizes  and  standardizes  the  internal 
functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The model is a product of the International 
Organisation  for  Standardisation (ISO).  The  model  groups  similar  communication  functions  into  one  of  seven  logical 
layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. The usage of OSI Model is so wide that it 
defines the way IT industry should design networking protocols. In this model, each layer can communicate with the layer 
above  and  below  it.  Each  layer  is  developed  independently  which  allows  flexibility  and  development  in  one  layer  to 
progress without delay from any other layer. As information passes through each layer relevant information from that 
layer  is  attached  -  this  process  is  commonly  known  as  Encapsulation.  Following  is  the  brief  overview  of  various 
vulnerabilities associated with each layer. 
 
Physical Layer Vulnerabilities:-  These include Loss of Power, Loss of Environmental Control, Physical Theft of Data 
and  Hardware,  Physical  Damage  or  Destruction  of  Data  and  Hardware,  Unauthorized  changes  to  the  functional 
environment  (data  connections,  removable  media,  adding/removing  resources),  Disconnection  of  Physical  Data  Links, 
Undetectable Interception of Data, Keystroke & Other Input Logging. The security issues become more pronounced when 
the network is based on a wireless media. A comparatively powerful transmission at same frequencies can easily affect the 
quality of service; if not fully deny the service to the user. The chances of passive attacks on wireless media are more as it 
is more susceptible to interception.  
 
Datalink Layer Vulnerabilities:-  
A  device running in promiscuous mode and a packet filter could be helpful or 
harmful  tools  at  OSI  Layer  two.  Allowing  flow  analysis,  problem  determination  and  code  debugging  can  be  helpful. 
However, in the wrong hands the ability to copy datagrams poses a threat. An example of a layer two threat is Libpcap, a 
packet capture driver that forces an NIC into promiscuous mode, allowing it to absorb traffic destined to other machines. 
Various known threats at layer 2 are:- Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table overflow, VLAN hopping, Spanning-
Tree Protocol Manipulation, Media Access Control (MAC) Address Spoofing, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attack, 
Private VLAN attack and DHCP starvation.

Network Layer Vulnerabilities:-  
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring 
variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network (in contrast 
to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network), while maintaining the quality of service requested 
by the transport layer. The IP address allows a system to contact the outside world and allows the outside world to contact 
the  host.  It  is  logical  to  consider  this  border  to our system  vulnerable. The following are the key  security risks at the 
Network Layer associated with the IP:- IP Spoofing, Routing (RIP) Attacks, ICMP Attack, PING Flood (ICMP Flood), 
Ping of Death Attack, Teardrop Attack and Packet Sniffing. 
  
Transport Layer Vulnerabilities:-  One way the Transport Layer ensures that there is reliability and error checking is 
through  the  Transport  Control  Protocol  (TCP).  Another  protocol  used  at  Layer  4  is  UDP  (User  Datagram  Protocol). 
Finding a system on the Internet requires knowing the public IP address assigned to it. To target a specific application on 
a  system,  an  intruder  would  need  to  know  the  IP  address  to  locate  the  system  and  the  port  number  assigned  to  the 
application, collectively referred to as a socket. A computer system has 65535 ports. These ports can be further broken 
down  into  three  categories:  well  known,  registered  and  dynamic.  This  is  where  Layer  4  security  is  applied.  Many 
applications utilize well known TCP and UDP ports. An attacker will gather information about a system using TCP and 
UDP.  There  are  many  ways  in  which  TCP  and  UDP  are  used to  infiltrate,  deny  services,  or  scan  networks.  The  key 
security  risks  associated with transport layer are:- TCP “SYN” Attack, SSL Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Land Attack, 
TCP Connecting Hijacking, UDP Flood Attack and Port Scan Attack. 
 
Session Layer Vulnerabilities:-   The  ‘session’  is  created  using  the three-way handshake. When a client establishes a 
connection  to  a  server,  the  client  sends  a  SYN  request;  the  server  responds  with  a SYN/ACK packet  and  the  client 
validates the connection with an ACK (acknowledgement) packet. A TCP connection cannot be established until these 3 
steps  have  been  completed.  The  vulnerabilities  associated  with  session  layer  are:-  DNS  Poisoning,  TCP  Session 
Hijacking, SYN Attack and SSH Downgrade Attack. 
 
Presentation Layer Vulnerabilities:-  The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. 
This  layer  formats  and  encrypts  data  to  be  sent  across  a  network.  It  is  sometimes  called the syntax  layer. Encryption 
services are associated with the Upper Layers of the OSI model, specifically the Presentation Layer.  When  the data is 
received, what form will it take? Encryption techniques allow us to scramble the packet contents, requiring a special code 
to reveal them. The more sophisticated the encryption algorithm, the harder it is to gain access to the data. Obviously, this 
intense processing function could affect system performance. Proper planning is necessary to calculate security needs and 
balance them with resource limitations. Vulnerabilities at this layer often originate from weaknesses or shortcomings in 
the  implementation  of  the  presentation  layer  functions.  Continuing  on  the  theme  of  taking  advantage  of  the  original 
atmosphere  of  implicit  trust  and  simple  functionality  that  systems  were  (and  continue  to  be)  built  in,  attackers  feed 
unexpected  or  illegal input into presentation-layer facilities, gaining results that are undesired or contrary to what the 
original designers intended. Some methods used are:- Buffer Overflows, Format String Vulnerabilities and  Attacking the 
NetBIOS.  
 
Application Layer Vulnerabilities:-.  This  OSI  layer  is  closest  to  the  end  user,  which  implies  that  both  the  OSI 
application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. Application-layer functions typically include 
identifying  communication  partners,  determining  resource  availability  and  synchronizing  communication.  When 
identifying  communication  partners,  the  application  layer  determines  the  identity  and  availability  of  communication 
partners for an application with data to transmit. Similar to the physical-layer, the open-ended nature of the Application 
Layer  groups  many  threats  together  at  its  end  of  the  stack,  some  of  which  are  as  below:-  Backdoor  Attacks,  
Authentication Attacks, Phishing Attacks and Access Attacks.    
 
The  Eighth  layer  –  Human  Layer  and  Vulnerabilities:-A  common  misconception  about  the  Open  Systems 
Interconnection model is that it contains only seven layers.  However, there exists an eighth layer  above “Application” 
commonly titled “User” or “Human Layer”. This is also called the Neuman’s Layer. This eighth layer must be considered 
when troubleshooting a network issue, as many times it can prove to be more of a common cause than the physical layer. 
A mistake or a deliberate tampering with any of the above layers by this eighth layer component can play havoc with the 
network. Common causes for failures at the Eighth layer of the OSI model include ID10T errors and policy-related issues. 
Seeing as to how the eighth layer interacts directly with the application layer, a problem at the eighth layer can cause 
problems at other layers at varying severity, depending on network security and privilege settings. Many layer 8 errors 
even cause failures at the physical layer, which is a fairly common occurrence. Indeed, the eighth layer can be in many 
cases very difficult to troubleshoot, but if kept within consideration all along the process of troubleshooting other layers, 
then a layer 8 issue may reveal itself to the   troubleshooter without going through all of the layers in between. Common 
causes  of  layer  eight  issues  are:-  Users  who  think  they  are  changing  a  critical  setting  to  make  something  “better”  or

a network cable for “security” then can’t connect the next day and a user who demonstrates the “clicking syndrome”,

ANALYSIS AND METHODOLOGY 

ANALYSIS :- 
In view of the threats listed above, there exists a void in establishing a compact model which also includes the ‘eighth 
layer’. Further, no research exists on a cumulative assessment of the security solutions implemented at individual levels. 
This paper therefore intends to create an evaluation criteria which takes into account the security solutions implemented 
in all the layers of the network. The author is therefore of the view that in any network the security assurance can only be 
evaluated based on an index that is a mathematical function of individual layer security indices. 
 
METHODOLOGY:- 
It  is  proposed  that  each  layer  of  the  OSI  model,  including  the  Eighth  Layer,  be  assessed  for  any  given  network. 
Depending upon the quality and quantity of security mechanisms employed for that particular network, certain marks will 
be awarded to each layer. These would be weighted against the threat sensitivity of that particular layer, implying that for 
any compromise in that particular layer, what would be the impact of loss of information in that network.  
Once  each  layer  has  been  graded  and  weighted,  the  individual  layer  values  will  be  added  and  again  normalized  as  a 
percentage. This final percentage will finally be assigned an alphabet grading, eg A is over 90, B is over 80 and so on. 
This would be the final gradation of the network under test. An example of ‘Policy’ layer table is given below.

IV. CONCLUSION 
Recent  literature  has  indicated  that  the  global  trend  is  towards  adopting  a  holistic  approach  to  Network  Security. 
Accordingly  extensive  research  is  currently  in  progress  to  analyse  and  model  network  flows.  The  current  paper  is 
anticipated to create a new benchmark in this important area of network security metrics. While the readers are familiar 
with  indices  for  (say)  financial  soundness  of  AAA  CRISIL  grading,  there  is  no  simplistic  grading  for  Information 
Security.    This  paper  outlines  a  methodology  to  achieve  the  same,  by  assessing  People,  Process  and  Technology  and 
grading these parameters to present a simplistic grading for the Information Network.

Abstract 

 

The proliferation of networks to a large population has increased network accessibility for a large section of hackers to abuse. Stronger 
security methods such as advanced encryption algorithms, efficient authentication process and ‘defense in depth’ approach are being used 
to address these threats. This paper gives a brief overview of various vulnerabilities associated with each layer of the OSI Model. Issues 
related to the “eighth layer” have also been elucidated. The authors proposes to carry out performance analysis of the cumulative effect of 
employing security mechanisms maintained at all layers of the network.

I.   INTRODUCTION 
Increasing lapses of cyber security in both defence, non-military networks, a growing threat of embedded malware, cyber 
attacks  from  inimical  elements  and  nations  has  brought  to  fore  the  immense  importance  of  network  security. 
Simultaneously, the proliferation of networks to a large population has increased network accessibility for a large section 
of  hackers  to  abuse,  which  is  finally  being  addressed  by  stronger  security  methods  such  as  advanced  encryption 
algorithms,  efficient  authentication  process  and  ‘defense  in  depth’  approach.  Every  network  administrator  ensures 
building adequate security measures at his level. Since all system administrators work in a disjoint manner and manage 
security solutions at different layers of OSI model, the global picture builds up a scenario, where the sender finds his data 
going through some encryption/security process at all levels starting from Application layer down to Physical layer and a 
decryption process at all layers at the receiver end. This paper makes a proposal to carry out performance analysis of the 
cumulative effect of employing security mechanisms at all layers of the network. 
 
II. MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY    
THE OPEN  SYSTEMS  INTERCONNECTION  (OSI)  MODEL AND  VULNERABILITIES  The Open  Systems 
Interconnection  (OSI)  model (ISO/IEC  7498-1)  is  a  conceptual  model that  characterizes  and  standardizes  the  internal 
functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The model is a product of the International 
Organisation  for  Standardisation (ISO).  The  model  groups  similar  communication  functions  into  one  of  seven  logical 
layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. The usage of OSI Model is so wide that it 
defines the way IT industry should design networking protocols. In this model, each layer can communicate with the layer 
above  and  below  it.  Each  layer  is  developed  independently  which  allows  flexibility  and  development  in  one  layer  to 
progress without delay from any other layer. As information passes through each layer relevant information from that 
layer  is  attached  -  this  process  is  commonly  known  as  Encapsulation.  Following  is  the  brief  overview  of  various 
vulnerabilities associated with each layer. 
 
Physical Layer Vulnerabilities:-  These include Loss of Power, Loss of Environmental Control, Physical Theft of Data 
and  Hardware,  Physical  Damage  or  Destruction  of  Data  and  Hardware,  Unauthorized  changes  to  the  functional 
environment  (data  connections,  removable  media,  adding/removing  resources),  Disconnection  of  Physical  Data  Links, 
Undetectable Interception of Data, Keystroke & Other Input Logging. The security issues become more pronounced when 
the network is based on a wireless media. A comparatively powerful transmission at same frequencies can easily affect the 
quality of service; if not fully deny the service to the user. The chances of passive attacks on wireless media are more as it 
is more susceptible to interception.  
 
Datalink Layer Vulnerabilities:-  
A  device running in promiscuous mode and a packet filter could be helpful or 
harmful  tools  at  OSI  Layer  two.  Allowing  flow  analysis,  problem  determination  and  code  debugging  can  be  helpful. 
However, in the wrong hands the ability to copy datagrams poses a threat. An example of a layer two threat is Libpcap, a 
packet capture driver that forces an NIC into promiscuous mode, allowing it to absorb traffic destined to other machines. 
Various known threats at layer 2 are:- Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table overflow, VLAN hopping, Spanning-
Tree Protocol Manipulation, Media Access Control (MAC) Address Spoofing, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attack, 
Private VLAN attack and DHCP starvation.

Network Layer Vulnerabilities:-  
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring 
variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network (in contrast 
to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network), while maintaining the quality of service requested 
by the transport layer. The IP address allows a system to contact the outside world and allows the outside world to contact 
the  host.  It  is  logical  to  consider  this  border  to our system  vulnerable. The following are the key  security risks at the 
Network Layer associated with the IP:- IP Spoofing, Routing (RIP) Attacks, ICMP Attack, PING Flood (ICMP Flood), 
Ping of Death Attack, Teardrop Attack and Packet Sniffing. 
  
Transport Layer Vulnerabilities:-  One way the Transport Layer ensures that there is reliability and error checking is 
through  the  Transport  Control  Protocol  (TCP).  Another  protocol  used  at  Layer  4  is  UDP  (User  Datagram  Protocol). 
Finding a system on the Internet requires knowing the public IP address assigned to it. To target a specific application on 
a  system,  an  intruder  would  need  to  know  the  IP  address  to  locate  the  system  and  the  port  number  assigned  to  the 
application, collectively referred to as a socket. A computer system has 65535 ports. These ports can be further broken 
down  into  three  categories:  well  known,  registered  and  dynamic.  This  is  where  Layer  4  security  is  applied.  Many 
applications utilize well known TCP and UDP ports. An attacker will gather information about a system using TCP and 
UDP.  There  are  many  ways  in  which  TCP  and  UDP  are  used to  infiltrate,  deny  services,  or  scan  networks.  The  key 
security  risks  associated with transport layer are:- TCP “SYN” Attack, SSL Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Land Attack, 
TCP Connecting Hijacking, UDP Flood Attack and Port Scan Attack. 
 
Session Layer Vulnerabilities:-   The  ‘session’  is  created  using  the three-way handshake. When a client establishes a 
connection  to  a  server,  the  client  sends  a  SYN  request;  the  server  responds  with  a SYN/ACK packet  and  the  client 
validates the connection with an ACK (acknowledgement) packet. A TCP connection cannot be established until these 3 
steps  have  been  completed.  The  vulnerabilities  associated  with  session  layer  are:-  DNS  Poisoning,  TCP  Session 
Hijacking, SYN Attack and SSH Downgrade Attack. 
 
Presentation Layer Vulnerabilities:-  The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. 
This  layer  formats  and  encrypts  data  to  be  sent  across  a  network.  It  is  sometimes  called the syntax  layer. Encryption 
services are associated with the Upper Layers of the OSI model, specifically the Presentation Layer.  When  the data is 
received, what form will it take? Encryption techniques allow us to scramble the packet contents, requiring a special code 
to reveal them. The more sophisticated the encryption algorithm, the harder it is to gain access to the data. Obviously, this 
intense processing function could affect system performance. Proper planning is necessary to calculate security needs and 
balance them with resource limitations. Vulnerabilities at this layer often originate from weaknesses or shortcomings in 
the  implementation  of  the  presentation  layer  functions.  Continuing  on  the  theme  of  taking  advantage  of  the  original 
atmosphere  of  implicit  trust  and  simple  functionality  that  systems  were  (and  continue  to  be)  built  in,  attackers  feed 
unexpected  or  illegal input into presentation-layer facilities, gaining results that are undesired or contrary to what the 
original designers intended. Some methods used are:- Buffer Overflows, Format String Vulnerabilities and  Attacking the 
NetBIOS.  
 
Application Layer Vulnerabilities:-.  This  OSI  layer  is  closest  to  the  end  user,  which  implies  that  both  the  OSI 
application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. Application-layer functions typically include 
identifying  communication  partners,  determining  resource  availability  and  synchronizing  communication.  When 
identifying  communication  partners,  the  application  layer  determines  the  identity  and  availability  of  communication 
partners for an application with data to transmit. Similar to the physical-layer, the open-ended nature of the Application 
Layer  groups  many  threats  together  at  its  end  of  the  stack,  some  of  which  are  as  below:-  Backdoor  Attacks,  
Authentication Attacks, Phishing Attacks and Access Attacks.    
 
The  Eighth  layer  –  Human  Layer  and  Vulnerabilities:-A  common  misconception  about  the  Open  Systems 
Interconnection model is that it contains only seven layers.  However, there exists an eighth layer  above “Application” 
commonly titled “User” or “Human Layer”. This is also called the Neuman’s Layer. This eighth layer must be considered 
when troubleshooting a network issue, as many times it can prove to be more of a common cause than the physical layer. 
A mistake or a deliberate tampering with any of the above layers by this eighth layer component can play havoc with the 
network. Common causes for failures at the Eighth layer of the OSI model include ID10T errors and policy-related issues. 
Seeing as to how the eighth layer interacts directly with the application layer, a problem at the eighth layer can cause 
problems at other layers at varying severity, depending on network security and privilege settings. Many layer 8 errors 
even cause failures at the physical layer, which is a fairly common occurrence. Indeed, the eighth layer can be in many 
cases very difficult to troubleshoot, but if kept within consideration all along the process of troubleshooting other layers, 
then a layer 8 issue may reveal itself to the   troubleshooter without going through all of the layers in between. Common 
causes  of  layer  eight  issues  are:-  Users  who  think  they  are  changing  a  critical  setting  to  make  something  “better”  or

“faster” without the slightest clue about what the setting actually does, e.g. changing TCP/IP settings, a user who unplugs 
a network cable for “security” then can’t connect the next day and a user who demonstrates the “clicking syndrome”, 
which causes such a wide array of problems that we couldn’t possibly list them all here.

ANALYSIS AND METHODOLOGY 

ANALYSIS :- 
In view of the threats listed above, there exists a void in establishing a compact model which also includes the ‘eighth 
layer’. Further, no research exists on a cumulative assessment of the security solutions implemented at individual levels. 
This paper therefore intends to create an evaluation criteria which takes into account the security solutions implemented 
in all the layers of the network. The author is therefore of the view that in any network the security assurance can only be 
evaluated based on an index that is a mathematical function of individual layer security indices. 
 
METHODOLOGY:- 
It  is  proposed  that  each  layer  of  the  OSI  model,  including  the  Eighth  Layer,  be  assessed  for  any  given  network. 
Depending upon the quality and quantity of security mechanisms employed for that particular network, certain marks will 
be awarded to each layer. These would be weighted against the threat sensitivity of that particular layer, implying that for 
any compromise in that particular layer, what would be the impact of loss of information in that network.  
Once  each  layer  has  been  graded  and  weighted,  the  individual  layer  values  will  be  added  and  again  normalized  as  a 
percentage. This final percentage will finally be assigned an alphabet grading, eg A is over 90, B is over 80 and so on. 
This would be the final gradation of the network under test. An example of ‘Policy’ layer table is given below.

IV. CONCLUSION 
Recent  literature  has  indicated  that  the  global  trend  is  towards  adopting  a  holistic  approach  to  Network  Security. 
Accordingly  extensive  research  is  currently  in  progress  to  analyse  and  model  network  flows.  The  current  paper  is 
anticipated to create a new benchmark in this important area of network security metrics. While the readers are familiar 
with  indices  for  (say)  financial  soundness  of  AAA  CRISIL  grading,  there  is  no  simplistic  grading  for  Information 
Security.    This  paper  outlines  a  methodology  to  achieve  the  same,  by  assessing  People,  Process  and  Technology  and 
grading these parameters to present a simplistic grading for the Information Network.
