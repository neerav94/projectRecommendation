Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using

the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5].

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution

performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each

time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively.

groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively. 

2.5. Muscle Activity Level Recognition 

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing.

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively. 

2.5. Muscle Activity Level Recognition 

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport

[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels.

 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data

variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing.

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively.

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature

denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

In  the  future,  additional  EMG  channels  will  also  be  examined  for  additional  distinctive 
features, such as joint angle, joint torque, or stiffness, which may result in either elimination 
of time interval consideration or more distinguishable muscle activation levels. Also, in order 
to  handle  subject  variation  problems,  additional  data  will  be  collected  to  perform  further 
experiments using non-linear SVM classifier that has greater generalization capability. 
 
5. Conclusion 

This  paper  presents  an  advanced  security  system  by  sensing  muscle  activation  from 
Electromyography  (EMG)  sensor.  In  order  to  combine  password  characters  and  muscle 
activation  levels  into  a  password,  an  algorithm  for  recognizing  different  muscle  activation 
levels  has  been  designed.  The  experimental  results  have  shown  that  the  algorithm  performs 
well  for  most  subjects  without  any  prior  learning  or  training.  Also,  the  usage  of  the  input 
combination can increase a system's safety without having to modify the original password's 
length  or  character  variation.  The  technique  is  also  not  limited  to  only  4-digits  numerical 
passwords.  Other  password  systems  with  greater  input  range,  such  as  alphanumeric 
passwords, can utilize the technique to further increase password complexity. Moreover, the 
system  allows  tight  integration  with  any  password  system  without  changing  the  way  a 
password is input into the system. 

In  conclusion,  EMG  signals  are  shown  to  have  the  capability  of  increasing  computer 
security.  The  muscle  activation 
levels  can  be  detected  easily  without  complex 
transformations,  resulting  in  ease  of  implementation.  The  proposed  system  can  mitigate 
possible damage from both computer attacks and a theft by prolonging the attacking time or 
acts as a fail-safe when a user's password is leaked to a third party. With EMG technologies 
becoming more stable and advanced, this experiment aims to urge the development of a more 
portable and economic type of EMG sensors that can be used in large scales.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively. 

2.5. Muscle Activity Level Recognition 

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

In  the  future,  additional  EMG  channels  will  also  be  examined  for  additional  distinctive 
features, such as joint angle, joint torque, or stiffness, which may result in either elimination 
of time interval consideration or more distinguishable muscle activation levels. Also, in order 
to  handle  subject  variation  problems,  additional  data  will  be  collected  to  perform  further 
experiments using non-linear SVM classifier that has greater generalization capability. 
 
5. Conclusion 

This  paper  presents  an  advanced  security  system  by  sensing  muscle  activation  from 
Electromyography  (EMG)  sensor.  In  order  to  combine  password  characters  and  muscle 
activation  levels  into  a  password,  an  algorithm  for  recognizing  different  muscle  activation 
levels  has  been  designed.  The  experimental  results  have  shown  that  the  algorithm  performs 
well  for  most  subjects  without  any  prior  learning  or  training.  Also,  the  usage  of  the  input 
combination can increase a system's safety without having to modify the original password's 
length  or  character  variation.  The  technique  is  also  not  limited  to  only  4-digits  numerical 
passwords.  Other  password  systems  with  greater  input  range,  such  as  alphanumeric 
passwords, can utilize the technique to further increase password complexity. Moreover, the 
system  allows  tight  integration  with  any  password  system  without  changing  the  way  a 
password is input into the system. 

In  conclusion,  EMG  signals  are  shown  to  have  the  capability  of  increasing  computer 
security.  The  muscle  activation 
levels  can  be  detected  easily  without  complex 
transformations,  resulting  in  ease  of  implementation.  The  proposed  system  can  mitigate 
possible damage from both computer attacks and a theft by prolonging the attacking time or 
acts as a fail-safe when a user's password is leaked to a third party. With EMG technologies 
becoming more stable and advanced, this experiment aims to urge the development of a more 
portable and economic type of EMG sensors that can be used in large scales.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively. 

2.5. Muscle Activity Level Recognition 

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

In  the  future,  additional  EMG  channels  will  also  be  examined  for  additional  distinctive 
features, such as joint angle, joint torque, or stiffness, which may result in either elimination 
of time interval consideration or more distinguishable muscle activation levels. Also, in order 
to  handle  subject  variation  problems,  additional  data  will  be  collected  to  perform  further 
experiments using non-linear SVM classifier that has greater generalization capability. 
 
5. Conclusion 

This  paper  presents  an  advanced  security  system  by  sensing  muscle  activation  from 
Electromyography  (EMG)  sensor.  In  order  to  combine  password  characters  and  muscle 
activation  levels  into  a  password,  an  algorithm  for  recognizing  different  muscle  activation 
levels  has  been  designed.  The  experimental  results  have  shown  that  the  algorithm  performs 
well  for  most  subjects  without  any  prior  learning  or  training.  Also,  the  usage  of  the  input 
combination can increase a system's safety without having to modify the original password's 
length  or  character  variation.  The  technique  is  also  not  limited  to  only  4-digits  numerical 
passwords.  Other  password  systems  with  greater  input  range,  such  as  alphanumeric 
passwords, can utilize the technique to further increase password complexity. Moreover, the 
system  allows  tight  integration  with  any  password  system  without  changing  the  way  a 
password is input into the system. 

In  conclusion,  EMG  signals  are  shown  to  have  the  capability  of  increasing  computer 
security.  The  muscle  activation 
levels  can  be  detected  easily  without  complex 
transformations,  resulting  in  ease  of  implementation.  The  proposed  system  can  mitigate 
possible damage from both computer attacks and a theft by prolonging the attacking time or 
acts as a fail-safe when a user's password is leaked to a third party. With EMG technologies 
becoming more stable and advanced, this experiment aims to urge the development of a more 
portable and economic type of EMG sensors that can be used in large scales.

Abstract 

This  article  describes  a  novel  type  of  an  advanced  mobile  security  system,  a  myokinetic 
password,  using  surface  electromyographic  (EMG)  signals.  We  proposed  an  advanced 
security  system  that  can  increase  password  strength  without  modifying  password  length  or 
increasing  alphabet  character  variation.  We  present  an  implementation  of  an  intuitive 
password system that combines muscle activation to enhance password complexity.  
The  muscle  activation  levels  from  EMG  signals  are  used  to  split  each  individual  code 
composition  into  multiple  states,  thereby  increasing  possible  password  combinations.  We 
proposed a centroid-based clustering algorithm to cluster a feature into groups according to 
the muscle activation. We also verified the possibility of expanding the technique to support 
up to three muscle activation levels in the experiment. By utilizing the proposed method, the 
number of possible input key combination is increased from 256 to 810,000 with three muscle 
levels.

1. Introduction 

Numerical  password  identifications  have  long  been  applied  in  various  technologies. 
Electronic  devices  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs),  security  doors,  and  mobile 
devices  adapt  the  system  due  to  the  design  aspects  that  allow  easily  memorable  passwords, 
high  verification  accuracy,  and  fast  input  method.  With  these  conveniences,  however,  fatal 
disadvantages  exist.  Numerical  passwords  in  such  system  have  small  combinations  and  can 
be easily cracked using simple algorithms [1, 2]. Ones password characters are leaked to third 
parties, no immediate countermeasures that prevent or mitigate damages, such as prolonging 
the safety period before successful exploitation, are provided. Thus, numerous researches are 
conducted in order to create a more robust and secure system. 

Apart from increasing the complexity of password characters, different types of password 
and input method are proposed to provide robust security. For example, Rass, et al., (2010) 
presented a detailed study of using Face-Recognition based authentication [3]. Also, the use 
of  biometrical  data  for  identity  identification  has  received  tremendous  amount  of  attentions 
during the past decades. Tan, et al., (2002) developed an approach to match fingerprints using 
Genetic Algorithms, which provides improved performance [4]. Hill, et al., (2002) described 
the  possibility  of  using  retinal  images  as  identification  method  and  its  disadvantages  [5]. 
However,  these  systems  are  either  not  user-friendly  or  too  expensive  to  be  implemented  in 
large scales. To look for a source of biometrical data that will not require drastic changes in

input method, muscles are worth mentioning because they correlates with the way we provide 
input to a system. 

Human muscles are very complex. Even though body posture remains unchanged, humans 
can  control  their  muscle  activities  in  a  way  that  reflects  force  or  resistance.  These  kinds  of 
activities  often  result  in  different  levels  of  electromyography  (EMG)  recordings  that  can  be 
distinguished from each other [6, 7]. However, biosignals such as EMG are very sensitive and 
subject-specific.  Gender,  age,  and  various  body  conditions  can  effect  the  readings  obtained 
from  a  user.  Therefore,  the  signals  need  to  be  normalized  and  observed  before  meaningful 
patterns can be analyzed. 

In this study, we developed a 4-digits numerical password system on an iPad with an EMG 
sensor attached to the user's forearm. The EMG signal from the sensor is transferred to a PC 
and  wirelessly  synchronized  with  touch  events  on  the  iPad  where  the  a  combination 
consisting of numerical characters and muscle activity levels are used as the system's input. 
The password authentication process is done using a within-user muscle activity recognition 
algorithm constructed based on training data. The algorithm is then validated on the same set 
of users to assess repeatability and usability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  introduces  the  system  along  with  its 
implementation  and  the  development  tools.  Experiment  details  and  algorithms  are  also 
included in Section 2. Experimental results are described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the 
potential of the constructed system and Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
2. Methods 

2.1. EMG - Digit Pass Code Security System 

We used a desktop EMG system, BagnoliTM 4, which is a complete EMG sensing solution 
developed by Delsys Inc. The EMG Systems has been deployed in various researches, such as 
motor control units analysis [8], presymptomatic indication [9], speech recognition [10], sport 
performance  assessment  [11],  prosthetic  limbs  design  [12],  and  computer  peripheral  design 
[13]. The system consists of arrays of sensors and that can be placed on various muscles to 
detect  electrical  potential  generated  by  muscles,  allowing  applications  on  fields  such  as 
medical and Human-Computer Interaction possible.

The  security  system  consists  of  two  primary  parts:  The  4  digit  passcode  system  was 
simulated  on  Apple's  iPad and  the  data  collection system  built  on Mac  OS X  using  Apple's 
Mac OS X SDK. The touch events on the iPad are then synchronized with the data collection 
system  through  socket  programming  techniques.  After  a  user  completed  his/her  password 
input,  the  EMG  data  for  the  entire  button  pushes  and  the  password  characters  are  sent  for 
authentication. Figure 1 shows the illustration of the proposed system. 
 
2.2. Procedure 

The  users  sat  on  a  chair  with  the  iPad.  We  recorded  EMG  signal  of  flexor  carpi  ulnaris 
using  active  surface  electrodes in  a  bipolar  configuration.  After  attaching  EMG  sensors,  we 
performed EMG calibration prior to validation test because there are personal differences on 
EMG  activities.  Then,  one  user  was  asked  to  perform  three  types  of  experimental  tasks  for 
algorithm as follows: 

Task1: Button push with muscle co-contraction, 2 activation levels. 
Task2: Normal button push, 2 activation levels. 
Task3: Normal button push, 3 activation levels. 

 
 
 
To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five  subjects 
were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects  will  have  to 
repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined  values  without  prior 
training. 

2.3. Preprocessing 

For  preprocessing,  the  incoming  signal  is  first  normalized  for  real-time  system  with 
reference to the algorithm in Kalanyu, et al., [14] where initial calibration is required. For this 
system,  each  subject  was  asked  not  to  activate  any  muscle  activity  for  two  seconds  for  the 
calibration to take effect. Here, the number of data needed for finding the maximum values is 
2,000.  This  corresponds  to  the  1  kHz  sampling  rate  with  16-bit  resolution  used  in  data 
collection.  Also,  mean  is  used  instead  of  median  due  to  the  concern  of  high  data 
variation resulting from the signal amplification rate applied. The modified algorithm is 
as follow: 

whereS  is  the  signal  in  time  t,  and  µ   is  the  mean  of  the  calibration  data  C.  After 
normalization,  EMG  signals  digitally  rectified  and  passed  through  a  second -order  low-
pass filter (cut-off frequency: 2.2 Hz) [15-17]. Figure 2 shows a portion of EMG signals 
before and after preprocessing. 

         (1) 

2.4. Feature Extraction 

For each task, training datasets were collected from each subject by asking them to perform 
three sets of button pushes with all task-specific muscle activation levels.  Then, segmentation 
technique is used to segment incoming data for feature extraction.  Since in the first task the 
muscle  is  activated  before  a  button  is  pushed,  data  for  each  button  is  segmented  from  the 
previous button push to the current but not more than 500 milliseconds.

This  is  different  from  the  second  and  the  third  task  where  incoming  data  is 
segmented between 200 milliseconds before button push and the time the subject finger 
is  released  from  the  button.  Figure  3  shows  the  data  when  segmented  according  to  the 
task.For  two  muscle  activation  levels  tasks,  standard  deviation  is  extracted  from  each 
segment and used as the classification feature. In case of three muscle activation levels, the 
time interval for each individual button push is also added as another feature.  Figure 4 shows 
the  characteristics  of  the  features  for  two  and  three  muscle  activation  levels  tasks, 
respectively. 

2.5. Muscle Activity Level Recognition 

For  each  task,  feature  vectors  calculated  from  each  data  segment  are  clustered  into 
groups  according  to  the  muscle  activation  levels  required.  In  order  to  cluster  a  feature 
vector  of  signal  segment  i,  a  simple  but  robust  centroid-based  clustering  algorithm  is 
proposed. The generalized form of the algorithm is as follows: 

Step  1:  The  matrix  containing  feature  vectors  is  normalized  to  eliminate  the  range 

difference between features using the following formula:

For three muscle activation levels: 

              (6) 

In this case, feature vector F for the first and the second task consist of { σ} while the 
third task  contains {σ, t} where σ  denotes standard deviation of a  signal  segment  and t 
denotes  the  time  interval  for  the  button  push  event  of  that  segment.  However,  the 
resulting algorithm provides wide cluster regions for “Not activated” and “Low”, which 
is not desired due to the stable characteristic of this level shown in Figure  4. Based on 
the  hypothesis  that  the  signal  remains  steady  on  the  baseline  with  low  variance  during 
non-activation  period,  the  following  modification  is  applied  during  the  computation  of 
Di,l to reduce the region of “Not activated” level: 

                                      (7) 

whereα is the weight factor for distance  Di,l. Whenα is greater than 1, the cluster region 
of “Not activated” and “Low” becomes smaller and more  ovalness. Figure 6 shows the 
clustering of data from a subject for all three tasks before and after α modification. After 
multiple  trials,  2  and  1.5  are  chosen  as  the  optimal  value  for  two  and  three  muscle 
activation levels tasks, respectively. 

Generally,  this  algorithm  outperforms  other  clustering  methods  such  as  K-means 
orK-medoids  clustering  algorithmsbecause  it  is  designed  for  small  datasets  where  the 
cluster centroids are fixed, making them immune to outliers and  noises, which can have 
noticeable  effects  on  data  clustering.  The  ability  to  incorporate  a  scaling  factor  makes 
the  algorithm  conform  to  the  characteristic  of  muscle  activation  signals  and  thus 
increases clustering efficiency. 

 

3. Results 

To  validate  the  accuracy  of  the  security  system  in  regards  of  repeatability,  five 
subjects  were  asked  to  test  a  4-digits  numerical  password  system  where  the  subjects 
will  have  to  repeat  10  password  inputs  into  the  system  according  to  the  predefined 
values  without  prior  training.  The  password  digit  remains  the  same  across  all  three 
tasks.  However,  strength  variations  for  the  password  are  arranged  so  that  each  m uscle 
activation  level  will  received  equal  portions  of  button  pushes.  After  the  testing  data  is 
collected from the system, it is classified and compared with the predefined label.

Figure 5. Classification Accuracy of each Subject 

 

Figure  5  illustrates  the  accuracy  for  all  three  tasks.  It  can  be  observed  that  in  most 
cases,  tasks  with  two  activation  levels  can  be  classified  with  100 \%  accuracy.  This 
finding  can  be  inferred  from  the  characteristic  of  the  standard  deviation  for  muscle 
activation  levels  in  Figure  6(a)  and  (b)  which  show  clear  distinction  between  “Not 
activated”  and  “Activated”.  The  result  from  the  third  task  shows  that  when  there  are 
three  or  more  muscle  activation  levels,  greater  control  precision  is  required  by  the 
subject in order to make clear difference between neighboring muscle activation levels. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  overlapping  of  feature  values  across  different  activation 
levels as shown in Figure 6(c). 
 
4. Discussions 

With the system fully integrated, the potential to increase security integrity is shown 
in  the  Table  1  where  criteria  such  as  possible  combinations  in  various  cases  are  listed 
together with the comparison cases for ATMs and mobile devices. It is shown that , with 
two and three  muscle activation levels, the number of possible input  key  combinations 
is  increased  from  10,000  to  160,000  and  810,000  respectively.  This  amounts  to  the 
increased  of  time  when  the  password  is  attacked  using  automated  algorithms  such  a s 
Brute-Force  attack.  Even  though  in  the  case  where  a  password  is  leaked,  the  attacker 
has to try at most 16 and 81 password combinations, respectively.  

This could be proved to be very useful for real-world systems such as ATM machines 
because  the  card  will  be  confiscated  after  three  wrong  attempts.  This  means  81.25 \% 
and 96.3\% in failing an ATM attack. For mobile devices such as iPhones where wrong 
attempts are allowed up to 10 times, the rate falls to 31.50 \% and 78.66\%, respectively. 
Another  indirect  benefit  is  that  it  allows  users  to  have  more  time  to  realize  the  lost  of 
their  belongings  and  call  their  providers  to  freeze  their  credit  cards  or  wipe  out 
important information on their mobile devices.

In  the  future,  additional  EMG  channels  will  also  be  examined  for  additional  distinctive 
features, such as joint angle, joint torque, or stiffness, which may result in either elimination 
of time interval consideration or more distinguishable muscle activation levels. Also, in order 
to  handle  subject  variation  problems,  additional  data  will  be  collected  to  perform  further 
experiments using non-linear SVM classifier that has greater generalization capability. 
 
5. Conclusion 

This  paper  presents  an  advanced  security  system  by  sensing  muscle  activation  from 
Electromyography  (EMG)  sensor.  In  order  to  combine  password  characters  and  muscle 
activation  levels  into  a  password,  an  algorithm  for  recognizing  different  muscle  activation 
levels  has  been  designed.  The  experimental  results  have  shown  that  the  algorithm  performs 
well  for  most  subjects  without  any  prior  learning  or  training.  Also,  the  usage  of  the  input 
combination can increase a system's safety without having to modify the original password's 
length  or  character  variation.  The  technique  is  also  not  limited  to  only  4-digits  numerical 
passwords.  Other  password  systems  with  greater  input  range,  such  as  alphanumeric 
passwords, can utilize the technique to further increase password complexity. Moreover, the 
system  allows  tight  integration  with  any  password  system  without  changing  the  way  a 
password is input into the system. 

In  conclusion,  EMG  signals  are  shown  to  have  the  capability  of  increasing  computer 
security.  The  muscle  activation 
levels  can  be  detected  easily  without  complex 
transformations,  resulting  in  ease  of  implementation.  The  proposed  system  can  mitigate 
possible damage from both computer attacks and a theft by prolonging the attacking time or 
acts as a fail-safe when a user's password is leaked to a third party. With EMG technologies 
becoming more stable and advanced, this experiment aims to urge the development of a more 
portable and economic type of EMG sensors that can be used in large scales.
