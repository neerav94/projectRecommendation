according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management,

and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS,

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills.

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations.

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

According  to  the  available  references  many  authors  focus  their  research  on  the 
technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

application levels) [1, 2, and 14]; Technical aspects of potential digital forensics in

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called

consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills.

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills.

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

According  to  the  available  references  many  authors  focus  their  research  on  the 
technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills.

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills.

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due 
forensic  needs 
individual 
responsibility of the security technologies managers.

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source;

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services:

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due 
forensic  needs

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible,

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due

responsibility of the security technologies managers.

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

requirements. 

For the CCSs users the best practice is to define a 
comprehensive security program or CC SMF, including 
security polices for all CC service life cycle activities. 

To provide isolation among different user services and 
network information flows, a CSP should separate the controls 
and flow of the network information. 

Use of  CMDB 

It is most important for CC maturity and effective resources 
and automated CC system processes management. 

Configuration integrity

Provided by software installation for the CC system

non-authorized modification is prevented. 

CSP must implement scalable and robust identity and access

authentication, authorization and user platforms management.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services:

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due 
forensic  needs 
individual 
responsibility of the security technologies managers.

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

agreed  upon  activities  by  the  clients  and  CSPs,  throughout  every  step  of  the  CC 
ISMS  implementation  process.  In  practice,  the  CSPs,  as  a  rule,  design  and  form 
SLA document, leaving more responsibilities for information security on the client 
side and without any word about possible incident, loss of the clients’ information 
and potential digital forensic (DF) investigation. Many authors and organizations 
(such  as  Gartner  group,  NSA,  Norton  Symantec,  etc.)  suggested  that  the  DF 
investigation  in  CC  system  has  become  almost  impossible  mission.  The  CSPs 
usually  claims  that  security  posture  in  CC  centre  is  at  highest  level  of  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  CC  centre.  However,  attacks  and  penetration 
into  CC  system  must  be  supposed,  although  there  is  no  much  information  about 
that.  That  is  why  clients  and  CSPs  must  cooperate  closely  to  prevent  cloud 
services misuse, including stealing information of the clients. Functional model of 
the CC ISMS implementation process (see Fig. 4) is adapted by the authors from 
best  practice  standardized  ISMS  (ISO/IEC  27001:2013). Many  phases,  steps  and 
activities  must  be  accomplished  by  consensus  of  the  clients  and  CSPs,  such  as: 
Scope  determination  and  management  support;  Identity  and  responsibilities 
requirements; Establishment of the CC ISMS implementation process and project 
budget;  Development  of  many  documents,  e.g.  security  policy  and  procedures, 
including  level  of  the  proactive  DF  infrastructure,  etc.  Most  likely,  closest 
collaboration  should  be  in  intention  and  responsibility  defining,  including 
information  security  and  digital  forensic  policies,  objectives  and  both  side 
responsibilities  and  obligations.  The  main  problem  in  this  process  could  be  the 
level of the potential DF investigation in CC system, in case of clients data lost in 
virtualized  CC  environment.  As  a  first  step  a  CSP  can  agree  upon  some  level  of 
DF investigation in CC system in the SLA document (Fig. 5). Implementing real 
time  monitoring  system  and  proactive  network  DF  infrastructure  can  help  to 
convince  clients  in  highest  level  of  the  CC  information  security  system.  In 
developing security profile both sides must align their Statement of Applicability 
(SoA) documents, at least regarding residual risk acceptance.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

According  to  the  available  references  many  authors  focus  their  research  on  the 
technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

application levels) [1, 2, and 14]; Technical aspects of potential digital forensics in

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

Security  control  that  includes  artificial  intelligence  mechanism  to  detect,  prevent  and  predict

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due

responsibility of the security technologies managers.

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

security polices for all CC service life cycle activities. 

To provide isolation among different user services and 
network information flows, a CSP should separate the controls 
and flow of the network information.

It is most important for CC maturity and effective resources 
and automated CC system processes management.

system  engineering  knowledge  and  process  approach,  CC  users  can  apply  some 
process model such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Act), Six Sigma, CMMI, etc. 
The  authors  suggested  PDCA  model  due  to  its  simplicity  and  broader  use  in  the 
many ISO standards. Implementation of the CC ISMS is the main purpose of the 
PDCA process model application. Functional model for ISMS implementing into

agreed  upon  activities  by  the  clients  and  CSPs,  throughout  every  step  of  the  CC 
ISMS  implementation  process.  In  practice,  the  CSPs,  as  a  rule,  design  and  form 
SLA document, leaving more responsibilities for information security on the client 
side and without any word about possible incident, loss of the clients’ information 
and potential digital forensic (DF) investigation. Many authors and organizations 
(such  as  Gartner  group,  NSA,  Norton  Symantec,  etc.)  suggested  that  the  DF 
investigation  in  CC  system  has  become  almost  impossible  mission.  The  CSPs 
usually  claims  that  security  posture  in  CC  centre  is  at  highest  level  of  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  CC  centre.  However,  attacks  and  penetration 
into  CC  system  must  be  supposed,  although  there  is  no  much  information  about 
that.  That  is  why  clients  and  CSPs  must  cooperate  closely  to  prevent  cloud 
services misuse, including stealing information of the clients. Functional model of 
the CC ISMS implementation process (see Fig. 4) is adapted by the authors from 
best  practice  standardized  ISMS  (ISO/IEC  27001:2013). Many  phases,  steps  and 
activities  must  be  accomplished  by  consensus  of  the  clients  and  CSPs,  such  as: 
Scope  determination  and  management  support;  Identity  and  responsibilities 
requirements; Establishment of the CC ISMS implementation process and project 
budget;  Development  of  many  documents,  e.g.  security  policy  and  procedures, 
including  level  of  the  proactive  DF  infrastructure,  etc.  Most  likely,  closest 
collaboration  should  be  in  intention  and  responsibility  defining,  including 
information  security  and  digital  forensic  policies,  objectives  and  both  side 
responsibilities  and  obligations.  The  main  problem  in  this  process  could  be  the 
level of the potential DF investigation in CC system, in case of clients data lost in 
virtualized  CC  environment.  As  a  first  step  a  CSP  can  agree  upon  some  level  of 
DF investigation in CC system in the SLA document (Fig. 5). Implementing real 
time  monitoring  system  and  proactive  network  DF  infrastructure  can  help  to 
convince  clients  in  highest  level  of  the  CC  information  security  system.  In 
developing security profile both sides must align their Statement of Applicability 
(SoA) documents, at least regarding residual risk acceptance.

be a starting point to increase trust among clients and a CSP. 

Conclusion 

The  CC  system  (CCS)  is  a  modern  computational  type,  including  informative, 
human, legal, business, philosophical, and  many other aspects. New types of  CC 
vulnerabilities  require  abandoning  the  traditional  container  type  protection 
concept. In the CC environment, especially for specific requirements, management 
of the CCSs life cycle, including the CC SMF and CC ISMS, must be established 
and  implemented.  In  order  to  establish  CC  ISMS  and  CC  SMF,  principles  and 
recommendations  of  the  ISMS  standards  (ISO/IEC  27K)  should  be  adapted  and 
included  in  CC  management  system,  and  the  traditional  security  management 
framework  (SMF)  should  be  enhanced  by  proactive  and  predictive  security 
controls, proactive forensic infrastructure and mandatory DF investigation process

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons

27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

Choice of the CSP should be based on its readiness for 
transparency in key security items, including DF processes. 

Security controls 

Security standards and 

practice 

Network isolation 

CSP should implement proactive and predictive security 
controls to be acceptable and to fulfil user and legal 
requirements. 

For the CCSs users the best practice is to define a 
comprehensive security program or CC SMF, including 
security polices for all CC service life cycle activities. 

To provide isolation among different user services and 
network information flows, a CSP should separate the controls 
and flow of the network information. 

Use of  CMDB 

It is most important for CC maturity and effective resources 
and automated CC system processes management. 

Configuration integrity 

Identity management 

Provided by software installation for the CC system 
configuration check and identification of system file platform, 
non-authorized modification is prevented. 

CSP must implement scalable and robust identity and access 
management systems, which establish strong identity 
authentication, authorization and user platforms management. 

Introducing  ISMS  into  CC  system  is  more  complex  process  than  doing  that  in 
LAN  or  distributed  computer  network  under  full  control  of  the  users.  However,

(ISMS) according to the standards ISO/IEC 27001&2: 2013 could be used. Using 
system  engineering  knowledge  and  process  approach,  CC  users  can  apply  some 
process model such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Act), Six Sigma, CMMI, etc. 
The  authors  suggested  PDCA  model  due  to  its  simplicity  and  broader  use  in  the 
many ISO standards. Implementation of the CC ISMS is the main purpose of the 
PDCA process model application. Functional model for ISMS implementing into

agreed  upon  activities  by  the  clients  and  CSPs,  throughout  every  step  of  the  CC 
ISMS  implementation  process.  In  practice,  the  CSPs,  as  a  rule,  design  and  form 
SLA document, leaving more responsibilities for information security on the client 
side and without any word about possible incident, loss of the clients’ information 
and potential digital forensic (DF) investigation. Many authors and organizations 
(such  as  Gartner  group,  NSA,  Norton  Symantec,  etc.)  suggested  that  the  DF 
investigation  in  CC  system  has  become  almost  impossible  mission.  The  CSPs 
usually  claims  that  security  posture  in  CC  centre  is  at  highest  level  of  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  CC  centre.  However,  attacks  and  penetration 
into  CC  system  must  be  supposed,  although  there  is  no  much  information  about 
that.  That  is  why  clients  and  CSPs  must  cooperate  closely  to  prevent  cloud 
services misuse, including stealing information of the clients. Functional model of 
the CC ISMS implementation process (see Fig. 4) is adapted by the authors from 
best  practice  standardized  ISMS  (ISO/IEC  27001:2013). Many  phases,  steps  and 
activities  must  be  accomplished  by  consensus  of  the  clients  and  CSPs,  such  as: 
Scope  determination  and  management  support;  Identity  and  responsibilities 
requirements; Establishment of the CC ISMS implementation process and project 
budget;  Development  of  many  documents,  e.g.  security  policy  and  procedures, 
including  level  of  the  proactive  DF  infrastructure,  etc.  Most  likely,  closest 
collaboration  should  be  in  intention  and  responsibility  defining,  including 
information  security  and  digital  forensic  policies,  objectives  and  both  side 
responsibilities  and  obligations.  The  main  problem  in  this  process  could  be  the 
level of the potential DF investigation in CC system, in case of clients data lost in 
virtualized  CC  environment.  As  a  first  step  a  CSP  can  agree  upon  some  level  of 
DF investigation in CC system in the SLA document (Fig. 5). Implementing real 
time  monitoring  system  and  proactive  network  DF  infrastructure  can  help  to 
convince  clients  in  highest  level  of  the  CC  information  security  system.  In 
developing security profile both sides must align their Statement of Applicability 
(SoA) documents, at least regarding residual risk acceptance.

All  other  steps  in  Fig.  5  such  as  training  and  awareness,  ISMS  operation,  and 
internal,  management  and  certification  audit,  could  be  performed  separately  and 
independently  at  both  side  locations.  Finally,  certified  ISMS  on  both  sides  could 
be a starting point to increase trust among clients and a CSP. 

Conclusion 

The  CC  system  (CCS)  is  a  modern  computational  type,  including  informative, 
human, legal, business, philosophical, and  many other aspects. New types of  CC 
vulnerabilities  require  abandoning  the  traditional  container  type  protection 
concept. In the CC environment, especially for specific requirements, management 
of the CCSs life cycle, including the CC SMF and CC ISMS, must be established 
and  implemented.  In  order  to  establish  CC  ISMS  and  CC  SMF,  principles  and 
recommendations  of  the  ISMS  standards  (ISO/IEC  27K)  should  be  adapted  and 
included  in  CC  management  system,  and  the  traditional  security  management 
framework  (SMF)  should  be  enhanced  by  proactive  and  predictive  security 
controls, proactive forensic infrastructure and mandatory DF investigation process

environment,  open  up  new  branches  of  smart  grid  computing  [8]  that  uses  more

attacks. Therefore, security system  in CC environment  should be embedded, and 
DF  investigation  of  computer  crime  in  the  CC  environment  should  be  enabled. 
Cloud  forensic  introduces  a  new  approach  to  the  traditional  DF  investigation 
methods and applications of the forensic tools and techniques. In this paper, a new 
framework  of  CC  management  system  and  potential  use  of  proactive  and 
predictive security controls, standardized ISMS and SMF, proactive forensic, and 
cloud  forensic  service  embedded  in  the  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS  is  suggested,  in 
order  to  improve  the  QMS  of  the  CCSs  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  data 
security between CSPs and customers. Except of the CC security and management 
systems  state-of-the-arts  overview,  comprehensive  security  principles  and

They are supposed to embed not only well-known security controls, but also some 
new  ones,  such  as  strong  authentication,  uninterrupted  real-time  monitoring,

The  detailed  process  model  and  data  flow  information  of  the  CC  ISMS  and  CC

standardized for more trusted, effective and efficient CC systems.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

According  to  the  available  references  many  authors  focus  their  research  on  the 
technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

application levels) [1, 2, and 14]; Technical aspects of potential digital forensics in

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

3.1 

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services:

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

requirements. 

For the CCSs users the best practice is to define a 
comprehensive security program or CC SMF, including 
security polices for all CC service life cycle activities. 

To provide isolation among different user services and 
network information flows, a CSP should separate the controls 
and flow of the network information. 

Use of  CMDB 

It is most important for CC maturity and effective resources 
and automated CC system processes management. 

Configuration integrity 

Identity management 

Provided by software installation for the CC system

non-authorized modification is prevented. 

CSP must implement scalable and robust identity and access

authentication, authorization and user platforms management.

system  engineering  knowledge  and  process  approach,  CC  users  can  apply  some 
process model such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Act), Six Sigma, CMMI, etc. 
The  authors  suggested  PDCA  model  due  to  its  simplicity  and  broader  use  in  the 
many ISO standards. Implementation of the CC ISMS is the main purpose of the 
PDCA process model application. Functional model for ISMS implementing into

(such  as  Gartner  group,  NSA,  Norton  Symantec,  etc.)  suggested  that  the  DF 
investigation  in  CC  system  has  become  almost  impossible  mission.  The  CSPs 
usually  claims  that  security  posture  in  CC  centre  is  at  highest  level  of  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  CC  centre.  However,  attacks  and  penetration 
into  CC  system  must  be  supposed,  although  there  is  no  much  information  about 
that.  That  is  why  clients  and  CSPs  must  cooperate  closely  to  prevent  cloud 
services misuse, including stealing information of the clients. Functional model of 
the CC ISMS implementation process (see Fig. 4) is adapted by the authors from 
best  practice  standardized  ISMS  (ISO/IEC  27001:2013). Many  phases,  steps  and 
activities  must  be  accomplished  by  consensus  of  the  clients  and  CSPs,  such  as: 
Scope  determination  and  management  support;  Identity  and  responsibilities 
requirements; Establishment of the CC ISMS implementation process and project 
budget;  Development  of  many  documents,  e.g.  security  policy  and  procedures, 
including  level  of  the  proactive  DF  infrastructure,  etc.  Most  likely,  closest 
collaboration  should  be  in  intention  and  responsibility  defining,  including 
information  security  and  digital  forensic  policies,  objectives  and  both  side 
responsibilities  and  obligations.  The  main  problem  in  this  process  could  be  the 
level of the potential DF investigation in CC system, in case of clients data lost in 
virtualized  CC  environment.  As  a  first  step  a  CSP  can  agree  upon  some  level  of 
DF investigation in CC system in the SLA document (Fig. 5). Implementing real 
time  monitoring  system  and  proactive  network  DF  infrastructure  can  help  to 
convince  clients  in  highest  level  of  the  CC  information  security  system.  In 
developing security profile both sides must align their Statement of Applicability 
(SoA) documents, at least regarding residual risk acceptance.

All  other  steps  in  Fig.  5  such  as  training  and  awareness,  ISMS  operation,  and 
internal,  management  and  certification  audit,  could  be  performed  separately  and 
independently  at  both  side  locations.  Finally,  certified  ISMS  on  both  sides  could 
be a starting point to increase trust among clients and a CSP. 

Conclusion 

The  CC  system  (CCS)  is  a  modern  computational  type,  including  informative, 
human, legal, business, philosophical, and  many other aspects. New types of  CC 
vulnerabilities  require  abandoning  the  traditional  container  type  protection 
concept. In the CC environment, especially for specific requirements, management 
of the CCSs life cycle, including the CC SMF and CC ISMS, must be established 
and  implemented.  In  order  to  establish  CC  ISMS  and  CC  SMF,  principles  and 
recommendations  of  the  ISMS  standards  (ISO/IEC  27K)  should  be  adapted  and 
included  in  CC  management  system,  and  the  traditional  security  management 
framework  (SMF)  should  be  enhanced  by  proactive  and  predictive  security 
controls, proactive forensic infrastructure and mandatory DF investigation process

that is specified up to the certain level in  the SLA. Quality of the  CCSs could be 
provided  by  implemented  both  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS.  Those  are  especially 
important  due  to  further  ISMS  and  security  field  investigations  in  the  CC 
environment,  open  up  new  branches  of  smart  grid  computing  [8]  that  uses  more 
efficient  network  computational  power,  but  requires  enhanced  information 
security,  and  proactive  and  even  predictive  protection  from  potential  cyber-
attacks. Therefore, security system  in CC environment  should be embedded, and 
DF  investigation  of  computer  crime  in  the  CC  environment  should  be  enabled. 
Cloud  forensic  introduces  a  new  approach  to  the  traditional  DF  investigation 
methods and applications of the forensic tools and techniques. In this paper, a new 
framework  of  CC  management  system  and  potential  use  of  proactive  and 
predictive security controls, standardized ISMS and SMF, proactive forensic, and 
cloud  forensic  service  embedded  in  the  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS  is  suggested,  in 
order  to  improve  the  QMS  of  the  CCSs  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  data 
security between CSPs and customers. Except of the CC security and management 
systems  state-of-the-arts  overview,  comprehensive  security  principles  and 
components  suggested  for  establishing  and  implementing  CC  SMF,  CC  ISMS, 
and  CCSs  quality  management  system,  are  the  main  contribution  of  this  paper. 
They are supposed to embed not only well-known security controls, but also some 
new  ones,  such  as  strong  authentication,  uninterrupted  real-time  monitoring, 
proactive  network  forensic,  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls,  embedded 
DF investigation infrastructure, etc. 

The  detailed  process  model  and  data  flow  information  of  the  CC  ISMS  and  CC 
SMF  implementation  process  suggested  by  authors,  should  be  subjected  to  the 
further  research.  A  new  system  of  legal  and  quality  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS 
security  policy  and  procedures  should  be  formally  described  and  defined,  and 
standardized for more trusted, effective and efficient CC systems.

Abstract: Numerous organizations coordinate and certify their information security systems 
according  to  the  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  standard.  Available 
Cloud  Computing  Services  (CCSs)  include  new  types  of  vulnerability  (management, 
virtualization,  sprawl,  etc.)  and  differ 
from  other 
computational  systems.  Establishing  a  consistent  security  management  framework  (SMF) 
and information security management system (ISMS) in CC environment is a complicated, 
demanding  and  time-consuming  process.  Every  experience  from  applying  ISMS  standard 
solutions  is  certainly  useful,  but not  enough  to  entirely  cover  all  security  requirements  of 
the  customers  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  (CSP).  Attempts  of  establishing  an  integrated 
and  consistent  SMF  and  ISMS  in  CC  environment  have  not  been  researched  in-depth  in 
recent  available  literature.  In  this  paper,  authors  suggested  a  framework  for  an 
establishing quality management system (QMS) of CCSs, including CC SMF and CC ISMS, 
proactive  digital  forensic  (DF),  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls  and  corporate 
DF investigation process up to the level specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

1  Introduction 

A manager of the clients’ information security system should consider the nature 
of  business,  degree  of  information  control  and  security  risks  within  a  Cloud 
Computing  (CC)  environment,  in  order  to  establish  consistent  and  quality 
management  system  (QMS),  and  an  information  security  management  system 
(ISMS). Establishing ISMS in a CC system should gather all of the solutions and 
experiences  in  related  technologies  that  are  included  in  CC  development. 
Establishing  a  Security  Management  Framework  (SMF)  and  the  methods  of 
security  risks  management  are  basic  requirements  for  designing  all  of  the  ISMS 
information systems, including a CC one. Establishing ISMS in a CC environment 
mostly  depends  on  the  model  of  the  CC  system  and  the  type  of  the  CC  service. 
The  greatest  number  of  the  ISMS  specifications  refer  to  the  public  CC  system, 
which is, in fact, the subject of this paper. In the model of the public CC system 
and  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS),  multi-tenancy  is  the  key  to  success.  An 
effective  and  fully  integrated  simple  template-based  model  transformation  and 
synchronization approach has  been proposed for the development of SaaS  multi-
tenant applications [14]. In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) type of CC service, a 
user  works  with  their  data  and  with  applications  on  hired  platform  from  Cloud 
Service  Providers  (CSP).  In  the  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS)-type  of  CC 
service,  the  infrastructure  is  entirely  owned  by  CSP,  and  the  user  installs  their 
applications  on  hired  platforms.  In  most  realistic  scenarios,  the  end  user  is 
responsible for using hardware and software in the CC environment. In such cases, 
focus is on security specifications of the main data in the CC environment and on 
influence of the virtualization and management on establishing SMF and ISMS in 
CC environment including improvement of the CCSs QMS.

technology solutions  for data  security of the clients in  CC  environment,  such as:

article,  Assessing  the  Security  Risks  of  Cloud  Computing,  in  June  2008,  etc. 
These  are  some  of  many  technical  solutions  suggested  for  improvement  of  data 
and privacy security in the CC system. 

Generally  CC  security  refers  to  a  broad  set  of  policies,  technologies  and  highly 
distributed security technical and procedural controls. After all, CC security is  an 
evolving  sub-domain  of  computer  security,  network  security,  cyber  security  and 
eventually information security. Authors of this paper contribute by assessing and 
collecting  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  CC  system  security,  and  by  suggested  CC 
SFM and CC ISMS including not only technical  security controls (proactive and 
predictive),  but  also  procedural  controls  and  contractual  obligations  to  overcome 
lack of trust in data security on both sides – CSP and customers. Vulnerabilities in 
virtualized CC environment are quite well described by IBM and many authors [4, 
5 and 13], etc. The authors of this paper suggested a comprehensive framework of 
CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  including  SMF  and  ISMS  recommended  by  standards 
ISO/IEC  27001/2:2013,  to  improve  CC  management  system  and  QMS  of  the 
CCSs  and  security  and  privacy  of  data,  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  CC 
environment. Furthermore, the authors suggested the overall strategy of CC QMS 
including  security  best  practice  principles,  real  time  managing  risk,  continuous 
monitoring,  and  proactive  and  predictive1  security  controls  to  increase  security 
and  enable  DF  investigation  in  CC  systems  up  to  certain  level  specified  in  the 
SLA. 

2  Virtual Infrastructure Management 

A  basic  driver  in  the  development  of  a  CC  service  is  virtualization,  which  most 
usually refers to virtualization of computers’ and networks’ hardware and it is the 
basis of public CC system configuration. In this way, different applications could 
be applied on different virtual platforms, but on the same physical machine [12]. 
The complexity of the virtual infrastructure management includes the following: 

  Mandatory control of availability and usage, and approach to the physical and 

virtual resources; 

 

Implementation of the solutions for special situations, and 

  Security  of  the  customers’  virtual  machines  (VM),  tasks,  monitoring  and 

reporting on the CC centre usage. 

In practice, there is a lack  of suitable tools and theory  for discovering errors and 
performances  analysis  of  the  ISMS  virtual  infrastructure.  Relative  independence 
of the numerous created VMs from physical  machines, results in  so-called liquid

Security  control  that  includes  artificial  intelligence  mechanism  to  detect,  prevent  and  predict

computing,  better  known  as  the  VM  sprawl  [19].  In  order  to  avoid  the  security 
risks  from  VMs  sprawl,  a  management  tool  limits  the  creation  of  new  VMs  by 
assigning  authorizations.  Further,  it  provides  a  strong  monitoring  system  which 
reports  about  allocated,  but  unused  VMs.  Because  of  the  requirements  for 
balancing load of the physical machine in the CC centre, locations of the created 
VMs and evaluation of the virtualized CC centre efficiency are specific problems. 

Consistent ISMS in a CC environment requires a strong monitoring system of the 
virtual  infrastructure  that  includes  monitoring  of  physical  hosting  servers,  virtual 
machine  monitors  (VMM)  or  hypervisor,  and  VMs  and  applications  that  operate 
on them. Virtual  machine Introspection (VMI), as the process by  which the state 
of  a  VM  can  be  observed  from  either  the  VMM  or  from  other  VMs,  is  a  new 
security  risk  factor  to  customers'  data.  That  is  why  VMM  has  full  access  to  the 
resources of all VMs and if it is compromised the customers' data can be misused, 
too. This phenomenon remains an open research problem. 

Monitoring  of  the  physical  servers  is  very  important,  because  of  hosting  a  great 
number of VMs, and the responsibility of the CSP. The CSP uses not only some of 
the  known  software  tools,  such  as  Open  Manage  and  IT  Assistant  (Dell),  Open 
View  (HP)  or  Nagios  (open  code), but  also  their  own  hardware  tools  with  better 
performances.  There  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  meaning  of  the 
terms  of  VMM  and  hypervisor.  A  VMM  monitors  and  directs  the  VM,  and  the 
hypervisor refers to the function of a machine’s kernel supervision, while in CC it 
means that the kernel supervises more than one VM (hypervisors). Therefore, in a 
CC  system,  the  hypervisor/VMM  could  be  considered  the  kernel  of  a  virtual 
infrastructure.  Some  of  the  more  famous  hypervisors  are  VMware  ESX,  which 
includes  web  interface  for  ESX  –  MUI  (Management  User  Interface)  for 
monitoring  and  management  of  the  current  VMM  usage,  Hyper  V  in  the  server 
Windows  2008  R2,  Windows  2012  OSs,  etc.  Usually,  for  the  monitoring  of 
applications on a VM and for applications on the physical machine, the same tools 
are  used,  but  the  difference  is  in  the  management  of  system  usage  from  the 
application side. 

3  Cloud Computing System Management 

In  theory,  as  well  in  practice  of  computer  science,  there  are  many  definitions  of 
service management [2], such as: 

  The capacity of the organizations to deliver services to clients 

  The  set  of  special  organizations’  capacities  for  giving  additional  values  to 

customers in the form of services 

  More  than  a  set  of  capacities,  because  it  includes  a  professional  team  of 

experts with specific knowledge and skills. 

 

– 150 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

The service delivery model in a CC environment refers to a set of more customers, 
assets, resources and capacities with flexible payment only, for what was used. 

Management  of  the  CC  system  services  is  an  inherent  vulnerability  in  a  CC 
environment,  not  only  because  of 
the  virtualization  and  accompanying 
vulnerabilities, but also because of certain other reasons. The main reason for the 
new  approach  to  the  CC  system  services  management  lies  in  the  enormous 
increase of digital information in the  world, and an  ever-more difficult and  more 
complex  management  of  the  so-called  digital  universe  and  big  data.  The 
organization  IDS.com  (Intelligent  Document  Solutions)  predicted  that  the  digital 
universe would grow from 1.2 million PB (petabytes, 1 PB = 1.000 GB) or 1.2 ZB 
(zeta bytes) in 2010, up to 35 ZB in 2020 [9]. As the CC is already becoming an 
integral part of the digital universe, more than 34% of the total digital data in the 
world  will  be  stored  or  secured  with  CC  services.  Until  2020,  CC  services  will 
become even more important, due to the following reasons [9]: 

  They  will  be  cheaper,  and  the  economy  of  organizations  will  initiate 

innovative development 

  They  will  become  much  more  important  for  individual  users  because  of 

mobile access possibility 

  They  will include advanced services (data compression, de-duplication, etc.) 
for easier management of the big data. They will become part of the solution 
for more efficient management of the digital universe. In a CC environment, 
management  of  the  performances  and  errors  should  be  entirely  automated, 
sophisticated  and  analytical.  The  CC  operator  should  adjust,  integrate  and 
coordinate  management  of  the  all  CC  functions.  Management  of  the 
infrastructure  change  and  configuration  in  the  CC  system  requires  fast 
reaction and the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be used 
for  better  performance.  For  the  effective  management  of  the  CC  server’s 
change and configuration, the CMDB must be embedded in this process and 
integrated with other controlling operations. 

The  tools  for  management  in  physical,  virtual  and  CC  environment  are 
comparatively shown in Table 1 [2].

Infrastructure Management in Cloud 

Holistic  method  of  the  integrated  management  of  the  physical  and  virtual 
resources  (Iaas)  is  the  main  problem  of  the  CSP.  The  main  goal  of  the  CSP 
management  is  to  secure  dynamic  and  fast  provisions  of  the  resources  for  CC 
applications. For this purpose, there is a tool already in development, the so-called 
Manager  of  Virtual  Infrastructure  (VIM)  [4],  which  is  usually  called  CC  OS 
(Operating  System)  [23]  or  CC  engine2.  This  type  of  software  resembles  a 
traditional  OS,  but  instead  of  managing  just  one  computer,  the  VIM  aggregates 
resources of  numerous computers  with a  uniform  view  at  users and applications. 
Two following categories of the tools for management of IaaS were suggested [2]: 

  Tool  sets  for  the  CC  system  that  provide  a  distant  and  secure  interface  for 
creating, controlling and monitoring the virtualized resources, but it is not as 
efficient for VIM as specialized tools. 

  The VIM tools  with automatic balance of load, consolidation of servers, but 

without an interface for distant access to the CC system. 

Both categories of tools are basic tools for the CC ISMS, or management of VM’s 
vital  cycle,  but  they  are  not  applicable  for  implementation  into  all  CC  systems. 
The  main  difference  between  these  two  categories  of  tools  is  that  the  CC  tools 
have  an  interface  for  remote  access  and  management  of  the  great  number  of 
consumers’ accounts.

3.2  Relationship Management among Cloud Service Provider 

and Consumers 

The concept of classic relationships of the CSP and consumers is shown in Figure 
1 [2]. 

Diagram of classic relationship between the CSP and service consumer [2] 

Figure 1 

 

In  the  CC  environment,  the  CSP  performs  many  activities  for  service  delivery, 
such as: defines the strategy, designs, invests, implements, transmits the data and 
operates  within  the  CC  infrastructure.  The  CC  services  increase  the  value  of  the 
customer’s  product  that  pays  for  what  they  use  and  they  do  not  accept 
responsibility for expenses of service delivery and its risks. To ensure satisfaction 
of  the  customers  with  the  quality  of  the  CC  services,  a  CSP  must  consider 
numerous factors, such as: nature of business and profiles of the target users, value 
of the CC services for users, form of use and payment for the services, security of 
the user’s information, possibility of digital forensic (DF) investigation in the case 
of  some  incidents,  etc.  The  CSP  can  increase  the  value  of  services  on  different 
levels, using different equipment, specialised technologies and additional services, 
etc.). 

Quality  of  the  CC  service  includes  two  basic  elements:  benefit,  or  what  the 
customer  gains,  and  assurance  of  the  service  delivery  –  available  on  time,  with 
sufficient capacity, and continuous and secured. Service value for the customers is 
a combination of these two elements. Estimation of the CC service quality mostly 
depends on the two component perceptions: expected value – service level that the 
user  expects,  and  empiric  quality  –  experienced  service  level  estimation  of  the 
user. There are various models for payment of the CC service, but payment for the 
used items are  mostly  applied (e.g. expenses  for electricity  and  water bills, etc.), 
and subscription (e.g. on an annual level). Security of the user's information is the 
key  factor of distrust in the CC systems.  In practice, it is defined as the share of 
responsibility  between  the  customers  and  the  CSP,  through  the  Service  Level 
Agreement  (SLA).  In  the  case  of  incidents  or  crime  in  the  CC  environment,  DF

investigation  is  naturally  expected,  but  it  is  almost  impossible  to  perform  in 
practice.  Implementation  of  the  proactive  forensics  [7,  21,  and  22]  and  the 
definition  of  some  level  of  forensic  investigation  in  the  SLA  and  CC  SMF 
documents are likely to yield solutions for the potential DF investigation in the CC 
system. They should be applied to the CC Service's Development Life Cycle (see 
Figure 2). 

Figure 2 

Development Life Cycle of the CC Services 

 

3.3  The Importance of Introducing Proactive Forensics into 

CC SMF and CC ISMS 

Proactive  forensics  could  be  defined  as  a  preventive  step  for  locating  and 
collecting  key  forensically  relevant  data.  In  the  CC  system,  with  multi-tenancy 
VMs,  the  rate  of  overwriting  data  is  much  larger  than  in  an  ordinary  computer. 
What  the  customers  and  CSP  do,  and  who  is  responsible  to  collect  forensic 
evidence  proactively  is  the  key  question?  Besides,  it  is  doubtful  whether  classic 
(or  post-mortem)  DF  investigation  can  be  applied  in  CC  system  at  all  [11]? 
Generally,  post-mortem  forensic  process  has  four  phases:  data  access  and 
identification, data acquisition, data analysis and evidence reporting. Access to the 
data  sources  and  collection  is  the  first  step.  Taking  forensic  images  to  the 
forensically sound media is the next step. In the analysis phase, the forensic image 
is  installed  by  outside  booting  processes  (usually  from  forensic  tools)  onto 
forensic  computers  for  analysis.  If  a  forensic  image  is  booted  onto  a  physical 
machine  with  different  hardware  configuration,  the  OS  will  discover  those 
differences  and  try  to  install  the  missing  drivers  into  image  and  contaminate  it. 
Obviously, it is unacceptable according to the principles of the DF science. In the 
CC  virtualized  environment  this  approach,  including  even  live  forensics,  is  not 
sufficient to recreate the original environment. Actually, VM simulates some basic 

 

– 154 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

hardware  components  and  does  not  support  a  wide  range  of  hardware  devices. 
Therefore,  a  forensic  image  cannot  be  installed  directly  into  a  VM  that  requires 
some  added  files  with  information  on  the  booted  system.  Some  forensic  tools 
could  resolve 
including  EnCase  Physical  Disk  Emulator 
(commercial),  ProDiscover  family  (commercial),  Live  View  (free),  and  others 
[11]. 

this  problem, 

A clause in the SLA, on some level of forensic investigation, could be a practical 
solution for the first time. It can provide an obligation for the CSP to proactively 
collect  forensically  relevant  data.  But  the  question  is:  who  is  to  be  trusted  with 
discovering  and  collecting  data,  and  identifying  the  nature  of  the  incident?  The 
security team, without forensic techniques, tools, knowledge and experience may 
compromise 
third-party  consultant  could  be 
unacceptable,  too.  A  well-trained  forensic  investigator  in  the  organization’s 
security team can provide the following services: 

the  evidence.  Hiring  of  a 

  Electronic information discovery 

  Forensic and technical consulting 

  Storage media forensic investigation 

  Proactive network digital forensic 

 

Internet forensics 

  E-mail and other messaging systems forensics 

 

Incident nature identification 

  Data collection and registration 

  Malware risk reduction. 

Generally,  proactive  forensics,  included  into  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS,  is  a 
promising  concept.  It  provides  protection  to  an  organization’s  responsibility, 
competency  advantages  and  forensic  evidence  collection  for  future  forensic 
investigations.  In  the  CC  ISMS,  a  strong  monitoring  system  should  be  a 
mandatory  proactive  measure,  including  monitoring  of  the  CC  centres,  CCSs 
availability, access and usage of VMs, data security, security emergency solution, 
flexibility for new VMs and new task additions. It is a good protection from VMs 
sprawl  vulnerability,  too.  Monitoring  of  the  VMs  in  the  CC  system  includes 
physical  servers,  VM  monitors  or  hypervisors  and  applications  running  on  the 
VMs.  Proactive  forensic  processes  of  the  CC  monitoring  system  include  the 
generation,  collection,  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  forensically  relevant  events 
instead of huge volumes of security events. It means that security problems could 
be stopped before critical escalations [11]. 

In  general,  computer  incidents’  proactive  forensics  in  an  organization  includes 
proactive identification and collection of digital traces, investigation and malware

risk  mitigation.  Eventually,  in  the  CC  system,  security  monitoring  has  a  much 
greater  importance  since,  it  simultaneously  provides  a  real-time  security 
monitoring alarms, reliable CC and security system functioning, and fast reaction 
against  incidents.  Defining  and  setting  forensic  evidence  selection  criteria  is  the 
main challenge in the networks and Internet forensics, including Cloud forensics, 
too. In the CC environment, Cloud forensics [13] means an application of the DF 
investigation  as  a  subset  of  the  CC  system,  computer  forensic,  and  network  and 
Internet forensic (Figure 3).

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

Monitoring  the  key  CC  service  performances  indicators  requires  metrics 
establishing in the design phase (see Figure 2) [6]. Examples of the metrics are as 
follows: 

  Service performances according to business and strategic plans 

  Financial gain to the business 

  Monitoring of the key ICT processes supporting CC services 

  Reporting on the level of services Customers’ satisfaction, etc. 

The final criteria that require many activities to achieve wanted quality of the CC 
service  management  must  be  implemented  before  service  delivery.  They  include 
investigation  of  the  CC  services  acceptance  against  overload,  users’  activities, 
error tolerance, data recovery, network delay, and payment process. 

3.4  Management of the SLA Agreement 

Agreement between the customers and CSP on the SLA is the main document. It 
is  based  on  the  users’  information  security  requirements  and  needs  for  DF 
investigation of computer misuse or criminal activities in the CC environment. In 
current  practice,  potential  DF  investigation  in  the  CC  environment  requires  a 
detailed SLA contract between the customers and CSPs that compels the CSPs on 
forensic investigation services up to the specified level. In this way, the customer 
knows  what  to  obtain,  or  not,  in  the  case  of  a  DF  investigation.  Requests  of  the 
customers for this CC service should become a standard part of the SLAs to secure 
their vulnerable information into the CC system. This implies that the CSP should 
implement security controls that could enable proactive digital evidence collection 
and DF investigation later on [22]. Proactive forensics means taking precautionary 
steps  that  do  not  include  the  need  for  locating  key  evidence  (“smoking  gun”)  in 
the  DF  investigation  process.  Some  CSPs  have  already  offered  DF  investigation 
up to the certain level, as a CC service [18]. 

3.5  Management of the Anti-Forensic Tools and Activities 

Legal  processes  for  the  DF  investigation  are  increasingly  becoming  mandatory 
services  in  the  ISMS  systems  [10  and  17].  Generally,  computer  criminals  use 
numerous  activities,  techniques  and  tools  to  disrupt  DF  investigation  process. 
Apart  from  classic  hacking  techniques  for  erasing  of  digital  traces  generated  by 
computer (such as PC Cleaner, Evidence Eliminator, etc.), setting of time bombs, 
applications  of  the  users  for  shut-down,  etc.,  some  anti-forensic  techniques  are 
also popular, including those mentioned in [23 and 16]: 

  Modification of the time seal 

  Header  change  and  file  extension,  extracting  hash  password  values  without 

leaving a trace

Introducing the Information Security Managment System in Cloud Computing Environment 

  Data mule types of attacks on the reserved sectors by the system on hard disk 

  Generating random file names (detection based on discovery of file signature 

is avoided), etc. 

3.6  Human Resources Management in Cloud Environment 

Quality  management  of  the  human  resources  and  cooperation  of  all  stakeholders 
are  the  most  important  factors  in  the  CC  system  management  and  for  successful 
corporate DF investigation. Management of the CC system that includes the CSP 
and customers  must explicitly support teams for corporate DF investigation  [17]. 
The  organisations  of  the  CSP  and  customers  must  establish  security  policies  and 
procedures for managing computer incidents and corporative DF investigations. In 
the case of braking into the CC security system, DF forensic expert has to lead DF 
investigation  process  and  harmonise  functions  of  the  team  combined  by 
programmers,  administrators,  engineers  of  network  equipment,  etc.  Digital 
forensic experts must provide professionals with various skills, job procedures and 
protection  of  digital  evidence  integrity  in  the  chain  of  custody.  All  participants 
who have access to the forensic data and evidence must maintain records for every 
activity in these procedures [15]. 

Carelessness of the managers and neglect of security events are common reasons 
for  numerous  court  cases.  It  is  particularly  easy  to  prove  consequences  of 
carelessness  and  neglect  of  the  plan  and  conduction  of  the  technologies 
management  strategy.  Documented  international  ISMS  standards,  ISO/IEC 
27001:2013  and  ISO/IEC  27002:2013  provide  necessary  instructions  regarding 
organization, methods, tools, security controls and procedures for the potential CC 
ISMS.  These  standards  should  be  supported  by  newly  developed  (or  in 
development  process)  set  of  standards  for  DF  investigation,  such  as  ISI/IEC 
27033,  ISI/IEC  27034,  ISI/IEC 27035, ISI/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27041, ISO/IEC 
27042  and  ISO/IEC  27043.  They  should  be  used  for  the  ISMS  implementation 
into the processes of CC information security systems, including DF investigative 
procedures,  due

3.7  Functional Model of Introducing ISMS into CC system 

For  the  reliable  identification  of  the  computer  incidents,  an  uninterrupted 
verification  of  data  source  signs  and  indicators  of  incident  is  required  [3].  Some 
standards  of  good  practice  in  proactive  detection  of  incidents  in  computer 
networks recommend the following activities [5]: 

  Data  users  should  develop  and  document  the  method  and  criteria  for 

evaluating quality of  incident data information source; 

 

– 158 – 

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 

Vol. 12, No. 3, 2015 

  Users  and  /  or  the  CSP  should  verify  information  on  an  incident  before 
importing  them  into  the  database  or  in  a  program  for  incident  management, 
but without the process flow being delayed; 

 

 

Information  on  an  incident  should  be  in  correlation  with  external  services, 
refilled  and  filtrated  in  order  to  prevent  event  duplication,  but  without  the 
process flow being delayed; 

If the source of information implements mechanisms of return links, the users 
should  use  it  in  the  case  of  request  for  quality  improvement  of  incident 
information; 

  Data sources for threats and attacks (CERT/CIRT), should develop its sensor 
networks  for  malware  detection  and  other  incident  indicators,  implement 
honeypot  and  sandbox  technologies  at  customer’s  side  and,  if  it  is  possible, 
implement passive scanners for DNS monitoring [19]. 

In  CC  environment  expected  level  of  the  company  security  and  business 
continuity  management  may  be  achieved  by  real-time  business  risk  assessment  
and  by  compliance  to  a  wide  range  of  security  expectations,  not  only  to 
recommendations  of  the  information  security  international  standards  [21].  The 
basic principles of good practice for introducing SMF and ISMS into CC system 
are suggested by authors and summarized in Table 3.

controls to be acceptable and to fulfil user and legal 
requirements. 

For the CCSs users the best practice is to define a 
comprehensive security program or CC SMF, including 
security polices for all CC service life cycle activities. 

To provide isolation among different user services and 
network information flows, a CSP should separate the controls 
and flow of the network information. 

Use of  CMDB 

It is most important for CC maturity and effective resources 
and automated CC system processes management. 

Configuration integrity 

Identity management 

Provided by software installation for the CC system 
configuration check and identification of system file platform, 
non-authorized modification is prevented. 

CSP must implement scalable and robust identity and access 
management systems, which establish strong identity 
authentication, authorization and user platforms management.

LAN  or  distributed  computer  network  under  full  control  of  the  users.  However,

(ISMS) according to the standards ISO/IEC 27001&2: 2013 could be used. Using 
system  engineering  knowledge  and  process  approach,  CC  users  can  apply  some 
process model such as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Act), Six Sigma, CMMI, etc. 
The  authors  suggested  PDCA  model  due  to  its  simplicity  and  broader  use  in  the 
many ISO standards. Implementation of the CC ISMS is the main purpose of the 
PDCA process model application. Functional model for ISMS implementing into

agreed  upon  activities  by  the  clients  and  CSPs,  throughout  every  step  of  the  CC 
ISMS  implementation  process.  In  practice,  the  CSPs,  as  a  rule,  design  and  form 
SLA document, leaving more responsibilities for information security on the client 
side and without any word about possible incident, loss of the clients’ information 
and potential digital forensic (DF) investigation. Many authors and organizations 
(such  as  Gartner  group,  NSA,  Norton  Symantec,  etc.)  suggested  that  the  DF 
investigation  in  CC  system  has  become  almost  impossible  mission.  The  CSPs 
usually  claims  that  security  posture  in  CC  centre  is  at  highest  level  of  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  CC  centre.  However,  attacks  and  penetration 
into  CC  system  must  be  supposed,  although  there  is  no  much  information  about 
that.  That  is  why  clients  and  CSPs  must  cooperate  closely  to  prevent  cloud 
services misuse, including stealing information of the clients. Functional model of 
the CC ISMS implementation process (see Fig. 4) is adapted by the authors from 
best  practice  standardized  ISMS  (ISO/IEC  27001:2013). Many  phases,  steps  and 
activities  must  be  accomplished  by  consensus  of  the  clients  and  CSPs,  such  as: 
Scope  determination  and  management  support;  Identity  and  responsibilities 
requirements; Establishment of the CC ISMS implementation process and project 
budget;  Development  of  many  documents,  e.g.  security  policy  and  procedures, 
including  level  of  the  proactive  DF  infrastructure,  etc.  Most  likely,  closest 
collaboration  should  be  in  intention  and  responsibility  defining,  including 
information  security  and  digital  forensic  policies,  objectives  and  both  side 
responsibilities  and  obligations.  The  main  problem  in  this  process  could  be  the 
level of the potential DF investigation in CC system, in case of clients data lost in 
virtualized  CC  environment.  As  a  first  step  a  CSP  can  agree  upon  some  level  of 
DF investigation in CC system in the SLA document (Fig. 5). Implementing real 
time  monitoring  system  and  proactive  network  DF  infrastructure  can  help  to 
convince  clients  in  highest  level  of  the  CC  information  security  system.  In 
developing security profile both sides must align their Statement of Applicability 
(SoA) documents, at least regarding residual risk acceptance.

Conclusion 

The  CC  system  (CCS)  is  a  modern  computational  type,  including  informative, 
human, legal, business, philosophical, and  many other aspects. New types of  CC 
vulnerabilities  require  abandoning  the  traditional  container  type  protection 
concept. In the CC environment, especially for specific requirements, management 
of the CCSs life cycle, including the CC SMF and CC ISMS, must be established 
and  implemented.  In  order  to  establish  CC  ISMS  and  CC  SMF,  principles  and 
recommendations  of  the  ISMS  standards  (ISO/IEC  27K)  should  be  adapted  and 
included  in  CC  management  system,  and  the  traditional  security  management 
framework  (SMF)  should  be  enhanced  by  proactive  and  predictive  security 
controls, proactive forensic infrastructure and mandatory DF investigation process

that is specified up to the certain level in  the SLA. Quality of the  CCSs could be 
provided  by  implemented  both  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS.  Those  are  especially 
important  due  to  further  ISMS  and  security  field  investigations  in  the  CC 
environment,  open  up  new  branches  of  smart  grid  computing  [8]  that  uses  more 
efficient  network  computational  power,  but  requires  enhanced  information 
security,  and  proactive  and  even  predictive  protection  from  potential  cyber-
attacks. Therefore, security system  in CC environment  should be embedded, and 
DF  investigation  of  computer  crime  in  the  CC  environment  should  be  enabled. 
Cloud  forensic  introduces  a  new  approach  to  the  traditional  DF  investigation 
methods and applications of the forensic tools and techniques. In this paper, a new 
framework  of  CC  management  system  and  potential  use  of  proactive  and 
predictive security controls, standardized ISMS and SMF, proactive forensic, and 
cloud  forensic  service  embedded  in  the  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS  is  suggested,  in 
order  to  improve  the  QMS  of  the  CCSs  and  to  increase  mutual  trust  in  data 
security between CSPs and customers. Except of the CC security and management 
systems  state-of-the-arts  overview,  comprehensive  security  principles  and 
components  suggested  for  establishing  and  implementing  CC  SMF,  CC  ISMS, 
and  CCSs  quality  management  system,  are  the  main  contribution  of  this  paper. 
They are supposed to embed not only well-known security controls, but also some 
new  ones,  such  as  strong  authentication,  uninterrupted  real-time  monitoring, 
proactive  network  forensic,  proactive  and  predictive  security  controls,  embedded 
DF investigation infrastructure, etc. 

The  detailed  process  model  and  data  flow  information  of  the  CC  ISMS  and  CC 
SMF  implementation  process  suggested  by  authors,  should  be  subjected  to  the 
further  research.  A  new  system  of  legal  and  quality  CC  SMF  and  CC  ISMS 
security  policy  and  procedures  should  be  formally  described  and  defined,  and 
standardized for more trusted, effective and efficient CC systems.
