Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a

between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,

discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-

sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 5 of 12

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 5 of 12

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

promote root growth and soil organisms that contribute to more
tillering, larger panicles, and more grain (Anil Verma).

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

promote root growth and soil organisms that contribute to more
tillering, larger panicles, and more grain (Anil Verma).

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 8 of 12

management to over 1 million ha in the 2013-14 sea-
son, and the aim of having 2.5 million ha for STI the
following year.

Direct-seeded STI follows SRI principles,

including
wider spacing (20 cm) between rows and enhancement
of soil organic matter with compost, supplemented with
some urea and DAP. These ‘STI-lite’ practices which im-
prove the balance of air and moisture in the soil require
less labor for sowing and weeding than does ‘full STI’
management. More intensive management which starts
with transplanting young tef seedlings and puts more
emphasis on organic soil fertilization can give farmers
even better results (Figure 7), but choice of methods is
left to farmers.

Like other crops, the tef genome is highly responsive to
management practices that do not crowd the plants to-
gether and that improve soil conditions. When individual
tef plants are given ample space, their leaves are longer
and wider; their darker green color indicates that the
plants’ photosynthetic efficiency, usually low, is enhanced
by their altered growing conditions. Tef plants given wider
spacing exhibit much larger and longer root systems.
These in turn support larger, taller canopies that resist
lodging, a major constraint with conventionally-grown tef.
For countless generations, this crop has been grown by
broadcasting with high plant densities. STI, in contrast,

reduces plant density by as much as 90%, using 9 to 15
million seeds/ha instead of 90 to 150 million/ha. By trans-
planting tef seedlings and making other changes in crop
management, the yields of tef grain and straw can be tri-
pled or more (Figure 8).

Other crops
In a review article like this, it is not possible to discuss
all of the SCI experience to date, such as with sugarcane
[39,40], mustard (Brassica rapa) [41], maize (Zea mays),
various legumes such as pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, also
known as red gram), mung bean (Vigna radiata, or
lentils (Lens culinaris, or black gram),
green gram),
broad bean (Vicia faba), soya bean (Glysine max), kidney
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and peas (Pisum sativum), as
well as a number of vegetables including tomatoes, chil-
ies, eggplant (aubergine or brinjal), and even a root crop,
turmeric [42], and castor bean in the spurge family [43].
Specific information on these crops is provided in [22].

Planting with space
As noted above, ISD in Ethiopia works with farmers
who are dependent on rainfed production, having small
parcels of land, from less than one-quarter to half a hec-
tare each. They live and farm mostly in drought-prone
areas of northern Tigray and South Wollo provinces, al-
though some are in better-endowed areas near Addis
Ababa. Following from farmer experimentation starting
in 2003, discussed above, when finger millet was first
established by transplanting seedlings, ISD has had little
difficulty in getting support from farmers and local ex-
tension staff to adapt SRI/SCI ideas to other crops under
the rubric of ‘planting with space’, a strategy that farmers
have found easy to comprehend [12,44].

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

promote root growth and soil organisms that contribute to more
tillering, larger panicles, and more grain (Anil Verma).

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

management to over 1 million ha in the 2013-14 sea-
son, and the aim of having 2.5 million ha for STI the
following year.

Direct-seeded STI follows SRI principles,

including
wider spacing (20 cm) between rows and enhancement
of soil organic matter with compost, supplemented with
some urea and DAP. These ‘STI-lite’ practices which im-
prove the balance of air and moisture in the soil require
less labor for sowing and weeding than does ‘full STI’
management. More intensive management which starts
with transplanting young tef seedlings and puts more
emphasis on organic soil fertilization can give farmers
even better results (Figure 7), but choice of methods is
left to farmers.

Like other crops, the tef genome is highly responsive to
management practices that do not crowd the plants to-
gether and that improve soil conditions. When individual
tef plants are given ample space, their leaves are longer
and wider; their darker green color indicates that the
plants’ photosynthetic efficiency, usually low, is enhanced
by their altered growing conditions. Tef plants given wider
spacing exhibit much larger and longer root systems.
These in turn support larger, taller canopies that resist
lodging, a major constraint with conventionally-grown tef.
For countless generations, this crop has been grown by
broadcasting with high plant densities. STI, in contrast,

reduces plant density by as much as 90%, using 9 to 15
million seeds/ha instead of 90 to 150 million/ha. By trans-
planting tef seedlings and making other changes in crop
management, the yields of tef grain and straw can be tri-
pled or more (Figure 8).

Other crops
In a review article like this, it is not possible to discuss
all of the SCI experience to date, such as with sugarcane
[39,40], mustard (Brassica rapa) [41], maize (Zea mays),
various legumes such as pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, also
known as red gram), mung bean (Vigna radiata, or
lentils (Lens culinaris, or black gram),
green gram),
broad bean (Vicia faba), soya bean (Glysine max), kidney
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and peas (Pisum sativum), as
well as a number of vegetables including tomatoes, chil-
ies, eggplant (aubergine or brinjal), and even a root crop,
turmeric [42], and castor bean in the spurge family [43].
Specific information on these crops is provided in [22].

Planting with space
As noted above, ISD in Ethiopia works with farmers
who are dependent on rainfed production, having small
parcels of land, from less than one-quarter to half a hec-
tare each. They live and farm mostly in drought-prone
areas of northern Tigray and South Wollo provinces, al-
though some are in better-endowed areas near Addis
Ababa. Following from farmer experimentation starting
in 2003, discussed above, when finger millet was first
established by transplanting seedlings, ISD has had little
difficulty in getting support from farmers and local ex-
tension staff to adapt SRI/SCI ideas to other crops under
the rubric of ‘planting with space’, a strategy that farmers
have found easy to comprehend [12,44].

For a number of crops, Ethiopian farmers are now ei-
ther transplanting young seedlings or sowing seeds dir-
ectly in rows, with wide spacing between the rows and

between the plants in each row. Farmers make and use
compost, which is now being promoted as part of the
government’s extension package in all crop-growing
areas, either to be used alone or with small supplemental
amounts of chemical fertilizer. Farmers control weeds by
breaking up the topsoil with a fork or some other imple-
ment that also aerates the soil. The crops whose yields
have been substantially improved this way include bar-
ley, durum wheat, maize, sorghum, tef, faba bean, and
lentils. Optimizing the spacing of plants proves benefi-
cial so long as the soil is well supplied with organic mat-
ter so that rainwater, dew and air can enter easily.

Extension of agroecological ideas to different
products and farming systems
Where this process on innovation will end cannot be
predicted. Growing numbers of farmers are gaining con-
fidence in their ability to produce ‘more from less’ and
to provide more adequately for their families’ food secur-
ity while enhancing the quality of their soil resources
and buffering their crops against the temperature and
precipitation stresses of climate change.

Unusual crops
There have been a number of unanticipated extrapola-
tions and extensions of SRI ideas and methods to quite
different kinds of agricultural production. Farmers who
understood the principles underlying SRI management
have adapted them, for example, to a root crop (tur-
meric), an entomological (insect) product (lac), and even
to animal husbandry (chickens) [22]. Through experi-
mentation, farmers have found that they could greatly
increase their output from existing resources by man-
aging these differently and better. Some of the changes
made in their production practices are ones that few re-
searchers would have been likely to imagine.

Smallholder diversification
While achieving greater productivity from individual
crops or commodities is important for farming house-
holds, families depend for their wellbeing on their whole
farming systems, not just on any one component of
these systems. In Cambodia, farmers working with the
NGO CEDAC have very small landholdings, on average
about 0.66 ha.

With CEDAC encouragement, several thousand farmers
have started capitalizing on the productivity gains that SRI
management is bringing to their paddy fields by reorganiz-
ing, diversifying, and intensifying their rice-based farming
systems. With their previous paddy yields now doubled or
tripled, farmers can take 30% to 50% of their paddy land
out of rice production, as they are able to meet or exceed
their households’ staple food needs by using SRI methods
on their remaining rice area [45].

The first step for such diversification is constructing a
pond, about 10 × 15 m in area and 2 to 3 m deep, which
can capture water during the rainy season and store it
into the dry season. Fish, eels, frogs, and other plants
and animals are raised in the pond and canals which
provide water and liquid manure to make the rest of the
farmed area more productive. A great variety of crops
and livestock are grown on the non-paddy area: toma-
toes, eggplants, watermelons, cucumbers, pumpkins;
mung beans and other legumes; bananas, papayas, and
other fruit trees; sugarcane, cassava, and maize in upland
areas; as well as chickens, pigs, and/or rabbits.

functions. During the early monsoon,

The ponds and canals in the rice fields serve a number
of
they help
farmers drain excess water from their rice fields, so that
young seedlings will not suffer from too-high water
levels in the fields. During short dry periods within the
monsoon, water from the pond can be used to irrigate
the young rice plants so they withstand water stress.
Frogs and fishes living in the ponds and canals help to
control insects during the growing season.

During the late monsoon, when the rice plants start to
flower, the frogs and fish move from the ponds into the
rice fields, where they find plenty of food. During the
grain-filling phase, the fields are kept flooded with just a
few centimeters of water to ensure sufficient supply for
producing full grains. When the crop is ripe, the fields
are drained for easier harvesting of the rice, and fish and
frogs can also be harvested at the same time, augment-
ing household income and food supply.

Details on cropping, land use, and investments made
from the experience of five innovative but representative
farmers are given in [45]. They have, on average, tripled
their household incomes, with annual cash earnings ris-
ing from $200 to $600. The average capital investment
required was only about $300, made incrementally over
several years with no borrowing needed.

Apart from these monetary gains, Cambodian farmers
appreciate the diversification and enrichment of their
household diets which this redesign of their farming sys-
tems makes possible. They also appreciate having mul-
tiple sources of income that bring in at least some cash
income throughout the year. Household food security no
longer depends just on their seasonal rice harvests with
one or two surges of income during the year. This in-
tensification also creates paid employment opportunities
in rural areas that make migration to urban areas less
necessary.

Farmers following agroecological management further
report improvements in their soil and water quality, with
less build-up of synthetic chemicals. Such a diversifica-
tion based on farming system intensification will not
meet the needs of all rural households; for example, it
requires at least some access to irrigation or sufficient

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 5 of 12

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

management to over 1 million ha in the 2013-14 sea-
son, and the aim of having 2.5 million ha for STI the
following year.

Direct-seeded STI follows SRI principles,

including
wider spacing (20 cm) between rows and enhancement
of soil organic matter with compost, supplemented with
some urea and DAP. These ‘STI-lite’ practices which im-
prove the balance of air and moisture in the soil require
less labor for sowing and weeding than does ‘full STI’
management. More intensive management which starts
with transplanting young tef seedlings and puts more
emphasis on organic soil fertilization can give farmers
even better results (Figure 7), but choice of methods is
left to farmers.

Like other crops, the tef genome is highly responsive to
management practices that do not crowd the plants to-
gether and that improve soil conditions. When individual
tef plants are given ample space, their leaves are longer
and wider; their darker green color indicates that the
plants’ photosynthetic efficiency, usually low, is enhanced
by their altered growing conditions. Tef plants given wider
spacing exhibit much larger and longer root systems.
These in turn support larger, taller canopies that resist
lodging, a major constraint with conventionally-grown tef.
For countless generations, this crop has been grown by
broadcasting with high plant densities. STI, in contrast,

reduces plant density by as much as 90%, using 9 to 15
million seeds/ha instead of 90 to 150 million/ha. By trans-
planting tef seedlings and making other changes in crop
management, the yields of tef grain and straw can be tri-
pled or more (Figure 8).

Other crops
In a review article like this, it is not possible to discuss
all of the SCI experience to date, such as with sugarcane
[39,40], mustard (Brassica rapa) [41], maize (Zea mays),
various legumes such as pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, also
known as red gram), mung bean (Vigna radiata, or
lentils (Lens culinaris, or black gram),
green gram),
broad bean (Vicia faba), soya bean (Glysine max), kidney
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and peas (Pisum sativum), as
well as a number of vegetables including tomatoes, chil-
ies, eggplant (aubergine or brinjal), and even a root crop,
turmeric [42], and castor bean in the spurge family [43].
Specific information on these crops is provided in [22].

Planting with space
As noted above, ISD in Ethiopia works with farmers
who are dependent on rainfed production, having small
parcels of land, from less than one-quarter to half a hec-
tare each. They live and farm mostly in drought-prone
areas of northern Tigray and South Wollo provinces, al-
though some are in better-endowed areas near Addis
Ababa. Following from farmer experimentation starting
in 2003, discussed above, when finger millet was first
established by transplanting seedlings, ISD has had little
difficulty in getting support from farmers and local ex-
tension staff to adapt SRI/SCI ideas to other crops under
the rubric of ‘planting with space’, a strategy that farmers
have found easy to comprehend [12,44].

For a number of crops, Ethiopian farmers are now ei-
ther transplanting young seedlings or sowing seeds dir-
ectly in rows, with wide spacing between the rows and

between the plants in each row. Farmers make and use
compost, which is now being promoted as part of the
government’s extension package in all crop-growing
areas, either to be used alone or with small supplemental
amounts of chemical fertilizer. Farmers control weeds by
breaking up the topsoil with a fork or some other imple-
ment that also aerates the soil. The crops whose yields
have been substantially improved this way include bar-
ley, durum wheat, maize, sorghum, tef, faba bean, and
lentils. Optimizing the spacing of plants proves benefi-
cial so long as the soil is well supplied with organic mat-
ter so that rainwater, dew and air can enter easily.

Extension of agroecological ideas to different
products and farming systems
Where this process on innovation will end cannot be
predicted. Growing numbers of farmers are gaining con-
fidence in their ability to produce ‘more from less’ and
to provide more adequately for their families’ food secur-
ity while enhancing the quality of their soil resources
and buffering their crops against the temperature and
precipitation stresses of climate change.

Unusual crops
There have been a number of unanticipated extrapola-
tions and extensions of SRI ideas and methods to quite
different kinds of agricultural production. Farmers who
understood the principles underlying SRI management
have adapted them, for example, to a root crop (tur-
meric), an entomological (insect) product (lac), and even
to animal husbandry (chickens) [22]. Through experi-
mentation, farmers have found that they could greatly
increase their output from existing resources by man-
aging these differently and better. Some of the changes
made in their production practices are ones that few re-
searchers would have been likely to imagine.

Smallholder diversification
While achieving greater productivity from individual
crops or commodities is important for farming house-
holds, families depend for their wellbeing on their whole
farming systems, not just on any one component of
these systems. In Cambodia, farmers working with the
NGO CEDAC have very small landholdings, on average
about 0.66 ha.

With CEDAC encouragement, several thousand farmers
have started capitalizing on the productivity gains that SRI
management is bringing to their paddy fields by reorganiz-
ing, diversifying, and intensifying their rice-based farming
systems. With their previous paddy yields now doubled or
tripled, farmers can take 30% to 50% of their paddy land
out of rice production, as they are able to meet or exceed
their households’ staple food needs by using SRI methods
on their remaining rice area [45].

The first step for such diversification is constructing a
pond, about 10 × 15 m in area and 2 to 3 m deep, which
can capture water during the rainy season and store it
into the dry season. Fish, eels, frogs, and other plants
and animals are raised in the pond and canals which
provide water and liquid manure to make the rest of the
farmed area more productive. A great variety of crops
and livestock are grown on the non-paddy area: toma-
toes, eggplants, watermelons, cucumbers, pumpkins;
mung beans and other legumes; bananas, papayas, and
other fruit trees; sugarcane, cassava, and maize in upland
areas; as well as chickens, pigs, and/or rabbits.

functions. During the early monsoon,

The ponds and canals in the rice fields serve a number
of
they help
farmers drain excess water from their rice fields, so that
young seedlings will not suffer from too-high water
levels in the fields. During short dry periods within the
monsoon, water from the pond can be used to irrigate
the young rice plants so they withstand water stress.
Frogs and fishes living in the ponds and canals help to
control insects during the growing season.

During the late monsoon, when the rice plants start to
flower, the frogs and fish move from the ponds into the
rice fields, where they find plenty of food. During the
grain-filling phase, the fields are kept flooded with just a
few centimeters of water to ensure sufficient supply for
producing full grains. When the crop is ripe, the fields
are drained for easier harvesting of the rice, and fish and
frogs can also be harvested at the same time, augment-
ing household income and food supply.

Details on cropping, land use, and investments made
from the experience of five innovative but representative
farmers are given in [45]. They have, on average, tripled
their household incomes, with annual cash earnings ris-
ing from $200 to $600. The average capital investment
required was only about $300, made incrementally over
several years with no borrowing needed.

Apart from these monetary gains, Cambodian farmers
appreciate the diversification and enrichment of their
household diets which this redesign of their farming sys-
tems makes possible. They also appreciate having mul-
tiple sources of income that bring in at least some cash
income throughout the year. Household food security no
longer depends just on their seasonal rice harvests with
one or two surges of income during the year. This in-
tensification also creates paid employment opportunities
in rural areas that make migration to urban areas less
necessary.

Farmers following agroecological management further
report improvements in their soil and water quality, with
less build-up of synthetic chemicals. Such a diversifica-
tion based on farming system intensification will not
meet the needs of all rural households; for example, it
requires at least some access to irrigation or sufficient

rainfall to fill ponds. But the productivity of rather small
extents of land can be greatly enhanced by this kind of
intensified agroecological management.

Larger-scale, mechanized operations
Agroecological innovations need not be limited to small-
holder farming. In Pakistan’s Punjab province, a large
farmer who is also a businessman, inventor, and philan-
thropist has developed several machines that implement
SRI principles in conjunction with conservation agricul-
ture (CA) and organic soil improvement, aiming to build
up soil fertility and to minimize external energy and
agrochemical inputs over time [46].

Initially, SRI methods were adapted to produce rice on
permanent raised beds formed by a specially-designed
machine on a laser-leveled, 8-hectare ‘test plot.’ Irriga-
tion/drainage ditches were formed in between the beds
to establish furrow irrigation for reducing water applica-
tions. Mechanized transplanting, precise spacing of plants,
precision applications of compost and some inorganic
fertilizer, plus fully-mechanized weeding to aerate the top-
soil between plants thoroughly, all contributed to a paddy
yield of 12 tonnes/ha. This yield was produced with 70%
reductions in both water and labor, compared to the usual
amounts of water and labor utilized for growing rice in
the region [46].

Now this technology is being adapted to many other
crops. This mechanized farming system, following CA
principles, including no tillage after the beds have been
formed, rotates various crops with rice or with each
other. These crops include wheat (with yield doubling to
7.3 tonnes/ha), carrots (tripled production), maize, cot-
ton, sunflower, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Large-
scale mechanized cultivation on permanent raised beds
together with furrow irrigation using siphons reduces
both water requirements and energy costs. Following
SRI principles is saving labor, cost, and water and build-
ing up soil fertility. These demonstrations indicate that
SCI presents opportunities for large-scale farmers also to
capitalize on the biological dynamics discussed here.
Starting in 2013, USDA and USAID programs
in
Pakistan have sponsored farmer field days for potato
production where SCI innovations are applied.

Conclusions
This review indicates that SCI is an evolving phenomenon,
still a work in progress [47], not yet getting much atten-
tion in scientific journals. Some of the data reported here
are from controlled, even replicated trials; but much sys-
tematic research remains to be done. Most of the data and
reports cited here are available online, presented not as
definitive results but as observations and measurements
that should attract the interest of researchers as well as

anyone concerned with improving agriculture and food
security in the world.

The data reported here and summarized in annexes to
[22] show considerable variability across crops and
countries, but generally speaking, there has been more
than a doubling of yields by using modified methods of
crop management. Crop-wise, the typical yield increases
range from 60% for sugarcane to 180% for wheat.

In economic terms, the per-hectare costs of produc-
tion with such intensification go up on average by about
50%. But with the increases in yield, the costs of produc-
tion per unit of crop output decline, on average by 40%
across the crops for which detailed cost and return data
farmers’ net income per
are available. Consequently,
hectare from these crops is usually considerably more
than doubled.

While the data presented here are not complete or
standardized enough for strong scientific conclusions,
the patterns of yield and profitability improvement are
dramatic and consistent enough to have attracted the
attention of already millions of farmers and also of pol-
icy makers, particularly in Ethiopia and Bihar state of
India [14,15].

This information has been assembled to bring these
opportunities to the attention of a wider audience that is
concerned with improving agricultural production and
food security, and one that also desires to conserve en-
vironmental resources and help farmers cope with in-
creasing climatic stresses now and in the future.

Finding explanations for the evident improvements in
soil/plant
interaction and crop performance presents
both challenges and opportunities to the scientific com-
munity. As no harm is seen from such modifications of
crop management practices, their experimentation, dem-
onstration, and adaptation represents an opportunity
available for both farmers and the agencies and profes-
sionals working with them for raising farmers’ yields and
incomes in ways that are environmentally benign.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests, having no
financial stake in any of the innovations reported. They have, of course,
personal and professional interests in the success of such innovations for
increasing farmers’ agricultural production and households’ food security.

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A
Satyanarayana, ANGRAU).

Figure 1 Demonstration of the yedekunte implement used by
farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

Ethiopia
Similar crop responses
to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 5 of 12

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

promote root growth and soil organisms that contribute to more
tillering, larger panicles, and more grain (Anil Verma).

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

management to over 1 million ha in the 2013-14 sea-
son, and the aim of having 2.5 million ha for STI the
following year.

Direct-seeded STI follows SRI principles,

including
wider spacing (20 cm) between rows and enhancement
of soil organic matter with compost, supplemented with
some urea and DAP. These ‘STI-lite’ practices which im-
prove the balance of air and moisture in the soil require
less labor for sowing and weeding than does ‘full STI’
management. More intensive management which starts
with transplanting young tef seedlings and puts more
emphasis on organic soil fertilization can give farmers
even better results (Figure 7), but choice of methods is
left to farmers.

Like other crops, the tef genome is highly responsive to
management practices that do not crowd the plants to-
gether and that improve soil conditions. When individual
tef plants are given ample space, their leaves are longer
and wider; their darker green color indicates that the
plants’ photosynthetic efficiency, usually low, is enhanced
by their altered growing conditions. Tef plants given wider
spacing exhibit much larger and longer root systems.
These in turn support larger, taller canopies that resist
lodging, a major constraint with conventionally-grown tef.
For countless generations, this crop has been grown by
broadcasting with high plant densities. STI, in contrast,

reduces plant density by as much as 90%, using 9 to 15
million seeds/ha instead of 90 to 150 million/ha. By trans-
planting tef seedlings and making other changes in crop
management, the yields of tef grain and straw can be tri-
pled or more (Figure 8).

Other crops
In a review article like this, it is not possible to discuss
all of the SCI experience to date, such as with sugarcane
[39,40], mustard (Brassica rapa) [41], maize (Zea mays),
various legumes such as pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, also
known as red gram), mung bean (Vigna radiata, or
lentils (Lens culinaris, or black gram),
green gram),
broad bean (Vicia faba), soya bean (Glysine max), kidney
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and peas (Pisum sativum), as
well as a number of vegetables including tomatoes, chil-
ies, eggplant (aubergine or brinjal), and even a root crop,
turmeric [42], and castor bean in the spurge family [43].
Specific information on these crops is provided in [22].

Planting with space
As noted above, ISD in Ethiopia works with farmers
who are dependent on rainfed production, having small
parcels of land, from less than one-quarter to half a hec-
tare each. They live and farm mostly in drought-prone
areas of northern Tigray and South Wollo provinces, al-
though some are in better-endowed areas near Addis
Ababa. Following from farmer experimentation starting
in 2003, discussed above, when finger millet was first
established by transplanting seedlings, ISD has had little
difficulty in getting support from farmers and local ex-
tension staff to adapt SRI/SCI ideas to other crops under
the rubric of ‘planting with space’, a strategy that farmers
have found easy to comprehend [12,44].

For a number of crops, Ethiopian farmers are now ei-
ther transplanting young seedlings or sowing seeds dir-
ectly in rows, with wide spacing between the rows and

between the plants in each row. Farmers make and use
compost, which is now being promoted as part of the
government’s extension package in all crop-growing
areas, either to be used alone or with small supplemental
amounts of chemical fertilizer. Farmers control weeds by
breaking up the topsoil with a fork or some other imple-
ment that also aerates the soil. The crops whose yields
have been substantially improved this way include bar-
ley, durum wheat, maize, sorghum, tef, faba bean, and
lentils. Optimizing the spacing of plants proves benefi-
cial so long as the soil is well supplied with organic mat-
ter so that rainwater, dew and air can enter easily.

Extension of agroecological ideas to different
products and farming systems
Where this process on innovation will end cannot be
predicted. Growing numbers of farmers are gaining con-
fidence in their ability to produce ‘more from less’ and
to provide more adequately for their families’ food secur-
ity while enhancing the quality of their soil resources
and buffering their crops against the temperature and
precipitation stresses of climate change.

Unusual crops
There have been a number of unanticipated extrapola-
tions and extensions of SRI ideas and methods to quite
different kinds of agricultural production. Farmers who
understood the principles underlying SRI management
have adapted them, for example, to a root crop (tur-
meric), an entomological (insect) product (lac), and even
to animal husbandry (chickens) [22]. Through experi-
mentation, farmers have found that they could greatly
increase their output from existing resources by man-
aging these differently and better. Some of the changes
made in their production practices are ones that few re-
searchers would have been likely to imagine.

Smallholder diversification
While achieving greater productivity from individual
crops or commodities is important for farming house-
holds, families depend for their wellbeing on their whole
farming systems, not just on any one component of
these systems. In Cambodia, farmers working with the
NGO CEDAC have very small landholdings, on average
about 0.66 ha.

With CEDAC encouragement, several thousand farmers
have started capitalizing on the productivity gains that SRI
management is bringing to their paddy fields by reorganiz-
ing, diversifying, and intensifying their rice-based farming
systems. With their previous paddy yields now doubled or
tripled, farmers can take 30% to 50% of their paddy land
out of rice production, as they are able to meet or exceed
their households’ staple food needs by using SRI methods
on their remaining rice area [45].

The first step for such diversification is constructing a
pond, about 10 × 15 m in area and 2 to 3 m deep, which
can capture water during the rainy season and store it
into the dry season. Fish, eels, frogs, and other plants
and animals are raised in the pond and canals which
provide water and liquid manure to make the rest of the
farmed area more productive. A great variety of crops
and livestock are grown on the non-paddy area: toma-
toes, eggplants, watermelons, cucumbers, pumpkins;
mung beans and other legumes; bananas, papayas, and
other fruit trees; sugarcane, cassava, and maize in upland
areas; as well as chickens, pigs, and/or rabbits.

functions. During the early monsoon,

The ponds and canals in the rice fields serve a number
of
they help
farmers drain excess water from their rice fields, so that
young seedlings will not suffer from too-high water
levels in the fields. During short dry periods within the
monsoon, water from the pond can be used to irrigate
the young rice plants so they withstand water stress.
Frogs and fishes living in the ponds and canals help to
control insects during the growing season.

During the late monsoon, when the rice plants start to
flower, the frogs and fish move from the ponds into the
rice fields, where they find plenty of food. During the
grain-filling phase, the fields are kept flooded with just a
few centimeters of water to ensure sufficient supply for
producing full grains. When the crop is ripe, the fields
are drained for easier harvesting of the rice, and fish and
frogs can also be harvested at the same time, augment-
ing household income and food supply.

Details on cropping, land use, and investments made
from the experience of five innovative but representative
farmers are given in [45]. They have, on average, tripled
their household incomes, with annual cash earnings ris-
ing from $200 to $600. The average capital investment
required was only about $300, made incrementally over
several years with no borrowing needed.

Apart from these monetary gains, Cambodian farmers
appreciate the diversification and enrichment of their
household diets which this redesign of their farming sys-
tems makes possible. They also appreciate having mul-
tiple sources of income that bring in at least some cash
income throughout the year. Household food security no
longer depends just on their seasonal rice harvests with
one or two surges of income during the year. This in-
tensification also creates paid employment opportunities
in rural areas that make migration to urban areas less
necessary.

Farmers following agroecological management further
report improvements in their soil and water quality, with
less build-up of synthetic chemicals. Such a diversifica-
tion based on farming system intensification will not
meet the needs of all rural households; for example, it
requires at least some access to irrigation or sufficient

rainfall to fill ponds. But the productivity of rather small
extents of land can be greatly enhanced by this kind of
intensified agroecological management.

Larger-scale, mechanized operations
Agroecological innovations need not be limited to small-
holder farming. In Pakistan’s Punjab province, a large
farmer who is also a businessman, inventor, and philan-
thropist has developed several machines that implement
SRI principles in conjunction with conservation agricul-
ture (CA) and organic soil improvement, aiming to build
up soil fertility and to minimize external energy and
agrochemical inputs over time [46].

Initially, SRI methods were adapted to produce rice on
permanent raised beds formed by a specially-designed
machine on a laser-leveled, 8-hectare ‘test plot.’ Irriga-
tion/drainage ditches were formed in between the beds
to establish furrow irrigation for reducing water applica-
tions. Mechanized transplanting, precise spacing of plants,
precision applications of compost and some inorganic
fertilizer, plus fully-mechanized weeding to aerate the top-
soil between plants thoroughly, all contributed to a paddy
yield of 12 tonnes/ha. This yield was produced with 70%
reductions in both water and labor, compared to the usual
amounts of water and labor utilized for growing rice in
the region [46].

Now this technology is being adapted to many other
crops. This mechanized farming system, following CA
principles, including no tillage after the beds have been
formed, rotates various crops with rice or with each
other. These crops include wheat (with yield doubling to
7.3 tonnes/ha), carrots (tripled production), maize, cot-
ton, sunflower, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Large-
scale mechanized cultivation on permanent raised beds
together with furrow irrigation using siphons reduces
both water requirements and energy costs. Following
SRI principles is saving labor, cost, and water and build-
ing up soil fertility. These demonstrations indicate that
SCI presents opportunities for large-scale farmers also to
capitalize on the biological dynamics discussed here.
Starting in 2013, USDA and USAID programs
in
Pakistan have sponsored farmer field days for potato
production where SCI innovations are applied.

Conclusions
This review indicates that SCI is an evolving phenomenon,
still a work in progress [47], not yet getting much atten-
tion in scientific journals. Some of the data reported here
are from controlled, even replicated trials; but much sys-
tematic research remains to be done. Most of the data and
reports cited here are available online, presented not as
definitive results but as observations and measurements
that should attract the interest of researchers as well as

anyone concerned with improving agriculture and food
security in the world.

The data reported here and summarized in annexes to
[22] show considerable variability across crops and
countries, but generally speaking, there has been more
than a doubling of yields by using modified methods of
crop management. Crop-wise, the typical yield increases
range from 60% for sugarcane to 180% for wheat.

In economic terms, the per-hectare costs of produc-
tion with such intensification go up on average by about
50%. But with the increases in yield, the costs of produc-
tion per unit of crop output decline, on average by 40%
across the crops for which detailed cost and return data
farmers’ net income per
are available. Consequently,
hectare from these crops is usually considerably more
than doubled.

While the data presented here are not complete or
standardized enough for strong scientific conclusions,
the patterns of yield and profitability improvement are
dramatic and consistent enough to have attracted the
attention of already millions of farmers and also of pol-
icy makers, particularly in Ethiopia and Bihar state of
India [14,15].

This information has been assembled to bring these
opportunities to the attention of a wider audience that is
concerned with improving agricultural production and
food security, and one that also desires to conserve en-
vironmental resources and help farmers cope with in-
creasing climatic stresses now and in the future.

Finding explanations for the evident improvements in
soil/plant
interaction and crop performance presents
both challenges and opportunities to the scientific com-
munity. As no harm is seen from such modifications of
crop management practices, their experimentation, dem-
onstration, and adaptation represents an opportunity
available for both farmers and the agencies and profes-
sionals working with them for raising farmers’ yields and
incomes in ways that are environmentally benign.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests, having no
financial stake in any of the innovations reported. They have, of course,
personal and professional interests in the success of such innovations for
increasing farmers’ agricultural production and households’ food security.

Authors’ contributions
The authors contributed written material, data, and pictures from their
respective involvements with SCI in different countries. BA supported
initiatives on SCI practices for finger millet and lac, building on PRADAN’s SRI
work with rice in Jharkhand state of India. HA and SE oversaw and facilitated
work with farmers in several provinces in Ethiopia on finger millet, tef, and
other crops ‘planting with space’. TB undertook the first trials with SRI
methods for tef in Ethiopia and continues to oversee a national government
program on STI. BG supported the extension of SRI concepts and practices
to sugarcane (SSI) in India after working with SRI as director of a WWF-ICRISAT
dialogue project on food, water, and environment in Hyderabad. RBK worked
with SWI for wheat as well as SRI for rice in the Far Western region of
Nepal under an EU-funded food security project implemented by FAO.
YSK introduced SRI for rice in Cambodia as director of CEDAC and then

encouraged farmers to develop their own diversified-intensified farming
systems in that country. DS has worked with farmers in northern India to adapt
SRI ideas for wheat, finger millet, maize, legumes, and other crops through the
People’s Science Institute based in Dehradun. AS developed custom-made
machinery as a private individual to reduce labor and save water while
raising the yields first of rice and then wheat, legumes, cotton, sunflower,
and other crops on raised beds with no tillage in the Punjab province of
Pakistan. ES assisted farmers in the Timbuktu region of Mali on behalf of Africare
to adapt SRI methods for wheat SWI. NU has visited and/or corresponded
extensively with all the other contributors, consolidating their knowledge
and experience into a monograph [22] and this review article. He has also
made field visits in India to learn about the farmer-initiated finger-millet
SCI known as Guli Vidhana in Karnataka, and SCI applications for turmeric
in Tamil Nadu and lac in Jharkhand states, and in Cambodia to see farmer
innovations with ‘diversified intensification’. AV introduced SRI and then
SWI in Bihar state of India, and then helped to extend applications of this
experience to mustard, finger millet, legumes, and numerous vegetable
crops. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Abstract

In the past half dozen years, farmers and professionals working with them in several Asian and African countries
have begun adapting and extrapolating what they have learned from and about the system of rice intensification
(SRI) to a range of other crops - finger millet, wheat, sugarcane, tef, oilseeds such as mustard, legumes such as soya
and kidney beans, and various vegetables - in what is being called the system of crop intensification (SCI).
As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants,
increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the
productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the
Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security
and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.
This review article reports on the productivity and other impacts being observed for many different crops in half a
dozen countries for increasing food crop yields with lower cost and input requirements as well as more resilience
to adverse effects of climate change. It also reports on mechanization innovations that reduce labor requirements
for these methods.

The need for sustainable intensification of
agricultural production
Although varying terminologies are being used by differ-
ent organizations, there is considerable agreement that
agricultural sectors around the world need to pursue
modified strategies for ‘sustainable intensification’ if glo-
bal food security requirements are to be met throughout
this century [1-6]. A common denominator for these
recommendations is their divergence from the kinds of
agricultural intensification that has been prevalent over
the past 50 years.

Technologies for modern agriculture particularly asso-
ciated with the Green Revolution have enabled farmers
with access to sufficient land, machinery, and purchased
inputs to cultivate ever-larger areas, raising production
by relying on improved crop varieties and utilizing more
water, capital
investment, fossil-fuel energy, and agro-
chemicals. Employing more inputs to obtain greater out-
put has improved upon the previous more extensive
strategies of production that were characterized by both
low inputs and low outputs. However, it has also become
associated with rising economic and environmental costs
for both farmers and ecosystems [7].

Intensification that depends essentially on greater use
of external inputs is not the only kind of intensification
available. There are other approaches to intensification
to be considered under the rubric of agroecology [8-10].

This seeks to make the most productive use possible of
available natural resources including the species and
genetic biodiversity found in nature. Particularly as land
and water resources become less abundant (and often of
lower quality) relative to the human populations that de-
pend on them, such resource scarcity places a greater
premium upon improving the management of all the
natural resources that are available.

The system of crop intensification
In recent years, something called the system of crop in-
tensification (SCI) has emerged in a number of Asian and
African countries, raising the productivity of the land,
water, seed, labor, and capital resources that farmers invest
can for growing a wide range of crops [11-13]. As noted
below,
this emergence is gaining recognition from
major institutions such as the Ethiopian government’s
Agricultural Transformation Agency [14] and the World
Bank [15,16].

The ideas and practices that have given rise to SCI
have derived from farmers’ and others’ experience with
the system of rice intensification (SRI) [17-19]. The
principles constituting both SCI and SRI, based on
demonstrated agronomic theory and practice, are shared
with other agroecological domains of innovation such
as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
integrated
pest management, and integrated range and livestock
management.

The common elements involved in SCI crop manage-
ment, extrapolated by farmers and others from what has
been learned from their SRI experience, can be summa-
rized as:
 Establishment of healthy plants both early and

attentively, taking care to conserve and nurture their
potential for root system growth and for associated
shoot growth;
 Significant reductions in crop density, transplanting

or sowing individual plants with wider spacing
between them, giving each plant more room to grow
both above and below ground;

 Enrichment of the soil with organic matter, and

keeping the soil well-aerated to support the better
growth of roots and of beneficial soil biota;
 Application of water in ways that favor plant-root
and soil-microbial growth, avoiding hypoxic soil
conditions that adversely affect both roots and
aerobic soil organisms.

The careful transplanting of young rice seedlings, a
key practice for SRI methodology, has been found to
have strong beneficial effects on some other crops such
as finger millet, mustard, and tef, but not for all. Direct-
seeding in conjunction with the other practices can be

part of SCI, reducing labor requirements. Or with some
crops like wheat it is simply more successful. Careful
crop establishment is an essential part of agroecological
management, whether for SRI or SCI.

Practices that apply these four principles are able to
raise substantially the productivity and profitability of
more ‘intensively’ managed crops. Improved production
methods that are grouped and extended under the rubric
of SCI are being scaled up in a significant way as seen in
India and Ethiopia:
 The World Bank has documented large productivity
and profitability gains for food-insecure households
under one of its projects in Bihar state. As of June
2012, it reports, 348,759 farmers were using SCI
methods on over 50,000 ha. It summarized their
yield increases as 86% for rice, 72% for wheat, 56%
for pulses, 50% for oilseeds, and 20% for vegetables.
The profitability increases for these different crops
were calculated, respectively, as averaging 250%, 86%
67%, 93%, and 47% [15].

 Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency is

applying, evaluating and extending SCI concepts and
practices to raise production of that country’s main
staple grain, tef. What is referred to as the system of
tef intensification (STI) is being promoted and
assessed in two versions. In the 2012–13 season,
160,000 Ethiopian farmers who participated in on-farm
trials with the less-intensive, direct-seeded version got
an average yield increase of 70%, while another 7,000
farmers who used the recommended, more-intensive
methods that involved transplanting had yield
increases of 200% to 300%, with 50% to 90%
reductions in seed [14].

This review article reports on SCI results being seen
already across a range of countries - India, Ethiopia,
Nepal, Mali, Cambodia, and Pakistan - for a wide variety
of crops. The management methods presented range
from highly labor-intensive to rather capital-intensive,
showing that the new systems of cultivation are not lim-
ited by scale any more than by climatic and soil condi-
tions. Where more labor is required, the returns to labor
are significantly increased, as well as to land, water, and
capital.

New opportunities are thus emerging for raising agri-
cultural production in ways that can directly reduce food
insecurity for several billion people and that do this in
environmentally-friendly ways that enable crops to with-
stand biotic and abiotic stresses which are becoming
more severe with climate change [20,21]. That SCI gains
in productivity are being achieved in places where food
insecurity is greatest - like Ethiopia, Bihar state of India,
the hills of Nepal, and the Timbuktu region in Mali -

makes the yield enhancements being achieved all the
more noteworthy for improving people’s lives and
livelihoods.

These innovations are being driven mostly by farmer in-
terests and initiatives, supported by professionals from
non-governmental organizations, government agencies and
research institutions, universities, and the private sector, all
represented by the contributors to this review. More detail
and more data are provided in a monograph prepared by
the authors based on their experiences and observations of
varied crops in their respective countries [22].

That most of the information is currently still in non-
published form does not make it untrue. Web links are
provided for most of the unpublished reports so that
readers can evaluate these for themselves. The authors
are not proposing that the methods reported here be
adopted on a mass scale without further investigation.
We believe, rather, that the methods reported deserve
further, systematic study and serious efforts at scien-
tific explanation, seeking to promote improved food
security especially among those resource-limited popu-
lations that labor under the severe challenges of cli-
mate change.

Crop adaptations and results
We are reviewing here what is being done and seen on
farmers’ fields rather than on experiment stations because
these innovations have been mostly developed empirically
on the ground. Few researchers have been involved in this
effort with scientific evaluations, but this is now changing
[23,24]. In this review, observed and measured outcomes
are communicated as accurately as possible from on-farm
situations. All comparisons of SCI results are with farmers’
present practices. While some readers might question the
reported SCI yields as absolute measures, similar reserva-
tions would not apply to the reported relative measures,
i.e., ratios of yield, since the same methods of measure-
ment were used for both sets of results.

Most of the impacts being observed and reported are
large and consistent enough that the usual statistical
tests of significance are of
less relevance than when
there are small differences that could be just measure-
ment artifacts or chance occurrences are being reported.
The photographic evidence that supplements the text re-
inforces the proposition that something of agricultural
significance is occurring, to be investigated more exten-
sively and systematically.

We review in some detail three major food crops import-
ant for food security in Asia and parts of Africa - finger
millet, wheat, and tef - because there is most information
and data available on the effects of SCI management for
these cereals. The effects of SCI for various other crops are
discussed only briefly here, with information on these
crops reported in [22].

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana)
Finger millet is the staple food for millions of poor
households in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and parts of East-
ern Africa. Its high nutritional content has made it a
food traditionally fed to pregnant and lactating women
and often used as a weaning food for babies.

India
Farmers in Haveri district in the southern state of Kar-
nataka over several decades developed their own set of
novel practices for finger millet that are remarkably
close to SRI management [25]. Conventional crop man-
agement, which starts with broadcasting finger millet
seed on a tilled field, gives yields between 1.25 to 2
tonnes/ha. With good irrigation and fertilizer applica-
tions, millet yields in the district can reach 3.75 tonnes.

With their Guli Vidhana methodology, farmers start by
making a square grid of shallow furrows on their fields
using a simple ox-drawn plow. The grooves in the soil,
made in parallel and perpendicular directions, are widely
spaced, 45 × 45 cm. At each intersection of the grid, two
young, 12-day-old seedlings are transplanted, putting a
handful of compost or manure around the roots to give
the young plants a good growing environment.

While the plants are still between 15 and 45 days after
transplanting, farmers pull a light board across the field
in several different directions. The board’s bending the
young plants over imposes some moderate trauma that
promotes the growth of more roots and tillers from
their crowns’ meristematic tissue. Concurrently, farmers
loosen the soil between the plants several times with an-
other ox-drawn implement that cuts the roots of any
weeds growing between the millet plants about 3 to 5 cm
depth below the soil surface (Figure 1). This active soil
aeration along with organic matter supplementation
enables the millet plants to have 40 to 80 tillers and to
give yields of 3.75 to 5 tonnes/ha, even up to 6.25
tonnes, which is two to three times the usual yield in
the district.

In the eastern state of Jharkand, Indian farmers after
they were introduced to SRI methods for growing rice
by the NGO PRADAN began experimenting with SRI
methods for their rainfed finger millet crop in 2005, call-
ing this the System of Finger Millet
Intensification
(SFMI). Usual yields there with traditional broadcast
practices are around 1 tonne/ha. By starting their crop
with young transplanted seedlings, widely spaced, and
with active soil, water and nutrient management, SFMI
yields rose to 3 or more tonnes/ha. While the intensified
management increases farmers’ costs of production by
about 25%, the higher yields that they get reduce their
costs of production from Rs 34.00 per kg of grain to Rs
13.50 per kg, a 60% reduction that makes SFMI very
profitable [26].

who transplanted finger millet seedlings there was
an elderly woman who obtained a yield equivalent to
7.8 tonnes/ha in 2003, compared to usual millet yields
of 1.4 tonnes/ha from fields established by broadcasting,
or 2.8 tonnes/ha with generous use of compost [12]. As
discussed below, farmers in Ethiopia have come to call this
methodology ‘planting with space’ and are applying it also
to other crops.

Figure 3 Demonstrations of the effect on root growth of
transplanting young finger-millet seedlings, 10 or 15 days old,
compared to older 21-day seedlings. The effect is seen with two
different improved varieties of finger millet. The trials were done by
crop scientists at the Andhra Pradesh state agricultural university in
Hyderabad in 2004 before farmer experimentation began. This effect
of transplanting young seedlings on plant root growth parallels that
achieved with SRI management for rice (O. sativa), a gramineae
species like finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (courtesy of Dr A

farmers in Karnataka state of India. The implement cuts weed
roots below the soil surface between rows, thereby also aerating the
top layer of soil (Norman Uphoff).

In northern India, the People’s Science Institute (PSI)
undertook the first trials of another version of SFMI in
2008. Forty-three farmers in the Himalayan state of Uttar-
akhand tried these methods on a small area of 0.8 ha.
Their results showed a 60% increase in grain yield, moving
from an average of 1.5 tonnes/ha to 2.4 tonnes/ha. By
2012, more than 1,000 farmers were using locally-adapted
SFMI methods, spacing their plants 20 × 20 cm apart and
establishing them either by direct-seeding or by trans-
planting young seedlings just 15 to 20 days old.

Such modified practices induce more productive millet
phenotypes as seen in Figure 2. This result can be ex-
plained at least in part by the enhanced root growth on
millet plants when seedlings are transplanted at a young
age. This was documented by university researchers in
Andhra Pradesh state before any farmer experiments
started in India (Figure 3).

to SCI management have
been observed in Tigray province. The first farmer

These methods have become standard practice among
farmers in the Axum area of Tigray. Yields now average
3.5 to 4 tonnes/ha, similar to SFMI yields in Bihar and
higher than those reported from northern India. Some
Tigrayan farmers have even obtained >6 tonnes/ha when
the rainy season is long enough, continuing from July
into mid-September. These farmers are all making and
using compost which they apply to the soil when they
transplant their seedlings.

Wheat (Triticum)
The extension of SRI practices to wheat was fairly
quickly seized upon by farmers and researchers in India,
Mali, and Nepal once they began seeing SRI effects with
rice.

India
What is now called the System of Wheat Intensification
(SWI) was first tested in northern India in 2006 by
farmers working with the People’s Science Institute
(PSI). First-year trials near Dehradun, using several var-
ieties, showed average increases of 18% to 67% in grain
yield and 9% to 27% higher straw yields (important for
subsistence farmers as fodder) compared with the yields
that farmers usually attained with conventional broad-
cast methods for crop establishment.

Impressed with these results, PSI began promoting
SWI in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
[27]. Starting with 50 farmers in 2007, the number of
smallholders using SWI methods expanded to more than
12,000 by the 2011–2012 winter season. Average in-
creases in grain yields from irrigated SWI reached 80%
to 100% over usual farmers’ practice, while in unirrigated
rainfed cultivation the yields with SWI methods were in-
creased by 60% to 80%. Despite the need for higher labor
investments in sowing and weeding operations, farmers
found the ratio of benefits-to-costs with SWI manage-
ment to be favorable due to the higher yields of grain
and straw.

Encouraged by good farmer response and results in
these two states, PSI has been promoting SWI within a
wider region of northern India since 2010, including sev-
eral districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
states. Households there suffer from low food productiv-
ity, having little irrigated area and frequent rainfall fail-
ures. Starting with 590 farmers in this expanded area in
2010, the number of SWI farmers rose to 1,015 the next
year, and by 2012, this number had grown to 4,350.
More details on PSI experience with SWI introduction
are given in [28].

The most dramatic results and the most rapid growth
in use of SWI have been in the state of Bihar where
landholdings are very small with an average of only
0.3 ha. At the initiative of the NGO PRADAN, 278

farmers in Gaya and Nalanda districts, mostly women,
tried out the new methods in the 2008–09 season. Their
yields averaged 3.6 tonnes/ha compared with 1.6 tonnes/
ha when using usual practices (Figure 4). The next year,
15,808 farmers using SWI methods had yields averaging
4.6 tonnes/ha. Two years later, the SWI area had ex-
panded to 183,063 hectares with support from the Bihar
Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (JEEVIKA), which
channeled World Bank/IDA funding for NGOs’ and
state extension activities [15]. Average SWI yields in
2012 were 5.1 tonnes/ha according to Bihar Department
of Agriculture calculations.

Intensified management for SWI requires more labor
and more organic matter inputs, so farmers’ costs of
production per hectare are figured to have risen by
about 60%. Still, with yields more than doubled, farmers’
net income per hectare has increased by 150%, from Rs
17,460 to Rs 43,952, as costs of production per kg of
wheat decline by 28%. Experience of Bihar farmers work-
ing with PRADAN,
is
summarized in [29].

including economic evaluation,

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in India has
also been introducing SWI in Bihar state with different
but still favorable results. It reported SWI yield increases
less than other parts of India,
just 32%, with farmers
averaging 3.48 tonnes/ha instead of 2.63 tonnes/ha with
usual practices. However, farmers’ costs of production
with this version of SWI declined by 2% per hectare ra-
ther than increasing. Accordingly, their cost per kg of
grain produced was Rs 8.17 with this less intensified ver-
sion of SWI compared to Rs 11.05 using standard prac-
tices. This SWI makes wheat cultivation more profitable,
as standard practices produce little net
income for
farmers, just Rs 1,802 per ha. On the other hand, with

SWI practices, farmers’ net income per ha was calcu-
lated to be Rs 18,265 [30].

Mali
The international NGO Africare introduced SRI methods
for irrigated rice into the Timbuktu region in 2007. During
an evaluation of SRI results the next year, when 60 farmers
had grown rice on side-by-side comparison plots using
SRI and conventional methods [31,32], the idea was put
forward by farmers to apply the same principles to wheat,
their winter crop.

Three farmers from three villages volunteered to do
SWI trials, using the same methods as SRI. But simply
imitating SRI was not very successful; the mortality of
transplanted seedlings was 9% to 22%, and 25 × 25 cm
spacing was too wide for plants to utilize all the arable
area. Transplanted SWI produced 29% less grain than
the control plots (1.4 tonnes/ha vs. 1.97 tonnes/ha).
Direct-seeded SWI, on the other hand, with widely-
spaced individual plants showed a 13% yield increase,
producing 2.22 tonnes/ha. Farmers were pleased with
their 94% reduction in seed requirements with this
method of SWI (10 kg/ha vs. 170 kg/ha); also they found
their labor investment reduced by 40%, and their need
for irrigation water was 30% less [33]. Thus,
farmer
interest in this innovation was aroused.

In the next season, 2009/2010, Africare undertook sys-
tematic SWI trials comparing different spacing and seed-
ing techniques [34]. While the highest yield (5.4 tonnes/
ha) was with spacing of 15 × 15 cm, closer than usual
SCI, all of the treatments that used single plants/hill
gave yields above 4 tonnes/ha with spacing ranging from
10 × 10 cm to 20 × 20 cm. Row-planting with 20 cm dis-
tance between rows also gave over 4 tonnes/ha (Figure 5),

and all these yields were higher than the 2.2 tonnes/ha
from the control lots that were broadcast with farmers’
methods (Styger, Ibrahim, and Diaty, unpublished).

In a third season, SWI trials continued among farmers,
even though Africare had no funding to support their
testing; the experience of 21 farmers was monitored.
Their average SWI yields were 5.45 tonnes/ha, compared
to 1.96 tonnes/ha from conventional practice (Styger and
Ibrahim, unpublished). The next year, when there was
drought and irrigation water was limited, Africare was able
to monitor 142 farmers using SWI methods in 13 villages.
Despite the adverse conditions, SWI yields averaged 3.2
tonnes/ha compared to 0.94 tonnes/ha on conventionally-
grown plots (Styger and Ibrahim, unpublished).

Farmers when interviewed indicated that applying
SWI on a larger scale is constrained by the lack of a
good implement for direct-seeding, as well as by difficul-
ties in soil preparation and manure transportation, and
by shortages of timely, small amounts of irrigation water.
These factors limit the area of land that can be planted
with SWI methods at present. Remedying these con-
straints could greatly enhance wheat production in Mali
in the future.

Nepal
A majority of Nepalese farmers are smallholders whose
landholdings are below 0.5 ha and whose wheat yields
usually average around 1.2 tonnes/ha. For the last half
decade, farmers have faced severe scarcity of fertilizers
for their main wheat cropping season, and rainfall in the
winter season has been erratic. These factors, plus very
low seed replacement rates in the hill and mountain
areas, have contributed to the extremely low productiv-
ity of wheat in Nepal.

Under an EU-funded Food Facility Program imple-
mented in the Far Western Region by FAO and local
NGOs, SWI concepts and practices were introduced to
smallholding farmers in 2009, using direct-seeding ra-
ther than transplanting because the former performed
better under local conditions. It was found that ‘sowing
with proper plant density allows for sufficient aeration,
moisture, sunlight and nutrient availability,
leading to
proper root system development from the early stage of
crop growth’ [35]. Such management was seen to lead to
more productive phenotypes.

Comparison trials in the 201011 season at 16 locations
in three districts
(Dadeldhura, Baitadi, and Kailali)
showed that SWI methods with seed-priming and line-
sowing, using a recommended improved variety (WK-
1204) and reducing the seed rate by >80%, gave small
farmers 91% more yield than from local practices with
this same variety (6.5 vs. 3.4 tonnes/ha). The number of
grains per panicle was 75 vs. 44, and grain weight (grams
per 1000 grains) was 29% higher with SWI (Figure 6).
Although farmers’ expenditures with SWI’s more inten-
sive crop management were 58% higher per ha (Rs 5,010
vs. Rs 3,170), farmers’ net income was more than dou-
bled, rising from Rs 4,830/ha to Rs 9,830/ha.

In the 2011-12 season, farmer field school experiments
conducted in Sindhuli district with similarly modified
SWI practices also showed better yield and economic
returns. Pre-germinated seed of Bhirkuti variety sown at
20 × 20 cm spacing gave 54% more yield than the avail-
able best practices under similar conditions of irrigation
and fertilization: 6.5 tonnes/ha from SWI methods com-
pared to 3.7 tonnes/ha with conventional broadcasting,
and 5 tonnes/ha with row sowing [36].

Figure 6 Comparison of wheat panicles from farmer field
school trials in mid-Nepal (Devraj Adhikari).

With SWI methods, farmers find their seed require-
ments reduced by 80% (20 kg/ha compared with 120 kg
for usual practice). This means that their limited supply
of improved seed can be used on four times more culti-
vated area, and purchasing fertilizer is less necessary if
biomass-based fertilizers can be procured locally.

Using improved seed with SWI crop management
techniques will enable an average household with six
members in the Far West, a region known for its ex-
treme poverty, to achieve an additional 6 months of food
security each year [35]. Ethiopian experience with other
versions of SWI is discussed below under Planting with
Space. In China, efforts have begun to combine SWI
with SRI in integrated farming systems [37,38].

Tef (Eragrostis tef)
Ethiopia
This crop, the preferred cereal in this large food-deficit
country, is grown from tiny seeds (2,500 per gram) that
are traditionally broadcast on repeatedly ploughed soil.
Despite much labor invested, mostly by women and chil-
dren, yields are usually only about 1 tonne/ha. Adapta-
tion of SRI methods to tef cultivation was started in the
2008-09 season under the direction of Dr Tareke Berhe, at
the time with the Sasakawa-Global 2000 program but now
director of the Tef Value Chain Program under the gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA).

By transplanting young, 20-day-old tef seedlings at
20 × 20 cm spacing with application of organic and inor-
ganic soil nutrients, tef yields could be raised to 3 to 5
tonnes/ha. Further, with micronutrient soil amendments
(Zn, S, Mn, and Mg), these improved yields could be al-
most doubled again, in what Tareke called STI, the sys-
tem of tef intensification.

In 2010, in collaboration with the Institute for Sustain-
able Development (ISD) which had obtained some fund-
ing from Oxfam America for SCI development, Tareke
conducted demonstration trials at two major centers
for agricultural research in Ethiopia. Good results
there gained acceptance for these new practices from
other tef scientists and government decision-makers,
and ATA began more systematic evaluations and dem-
onstrations [24].

In the 2011–12 season, 1,400 farmers who used STI
methods averaged 2.7 tonnes/ha, with yields as high as 5
tonnes/ha. Then in the 2012-13 season, 7,000 farmers
used STI methods in expanded trials with transplanted
seedlings, while another 160,000 farmers applied less in-
tensified methods, doing direct-seeding in rows instead
of transplanting. This kind of ‘STI-lite’ raised tef yields
on a large scale from 1.2 tonnes/ha to 2.1 tonnes/ha,
based on results gathered from 15,800 farmers and 1,100
farmer training centers [14]. With such results, the
Ethiopian government has scaled up the area for STI

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

management to over 1 million ha in the 2013-14 sea-
son, and the aim of having 2.5 million ha for STI the
following year.

Direct-seeded STI follows SRI principles,

including
wider spacing (20 cm) between rows and enhancement
of soil organic matter with compost, supplemented with
some urea and DAP. These ‘STI-lite’ practices which im-
prove the balance of air and moisture in the soil require
less labor for sowing and weeding than does ‘full STI’
management. More intensive management which starts
with transplanting young tef seedlings and puts more
emphasis on organic soil fertilization can give farmers
even better results (Figure 7), but choice of methods is
left to farmers.

Like other crops, the tef genome is highly responsive to
management practices that do not crowd the plants to-
gether and that improve soil conditions. When individual
tef plants are given ample space, their leaves are longer
and wider; their darker green color indicates that the
plants’ photosynthetic efficiency, usually low, is enhanced
by their altered growing conditions. Tef plants given wider
spacing exhibit much larger and longer root systems.
These in turn support larger, taller canopies that resist
lodging, a major constraint with conventionally-grown tef.
For countless generations, this crop has been grown by
broadcasting with high plant densities. STI, in contrast,

reduces plant density by as much as 90%, using 9 to 15
million seeds/ha instead of 90 to 150 million/ha. By trans-
planting tef seedlings and making other changes in crop
management, the yields of tef grain and straw can be tri-
pled or more (Figure 8).

Other crops
In a review article like this, it is not possible to discuss
all of the SCI experience to date, such as with sugarcane
[39,40], mustard (Brassica rapa) [41], maize (Zea mays),
various legumes such as pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, also
known as red gram), mung bean (Vigna radiata, or
lentils (Lens culinaris, or black gram),
green gram),
broad bean (Vicia faba), soya bean (Glysine max), kidney
beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and peas (Pisum sativum), as
well as a number of vegetables including tomatoes, chil-
ies, eggplant (aubergine or brinjal), and even a root crop,
turmeric [42], and castor bean in the spurge family [43].
Specific information on these crops is provided in [22].

Planting with space
As noted above, ISD in Ethiopia works with farmers
who are dependent on rainfed production, having small
parcels of land, from less than one-quarter to half a hec-
tare each. They live and farm mostly in drought-prone
areas of northern Tigray and South Wollo provinces, al-
though some are in better-endowed areas near Addis
Ababa. Following from farmer experimentation starting
in 2003, discussed above, when finger millet was first
established by transplanting seedlings, ISD has had little
difficulty in getting support from farmers and local ex-
tension staff to adapt SRI/SCI ideas to other crops under
the rubric of ‘planting with space’, a strategy that farmers
have found easy to comprehend [12,44].

For a number of crops, Ethiopian farmers are now ei-
ther transplanting young seedlings or sowing seeds dir-
ectly in rows, with wide spacing between the rows and

between the plants in each row. Farmers make and use
compost, which is now being promoted as part of the
government’s extension package in all crop-growing
areas, either to be used alone or with small supplemental
amounts of chemical fertilizer. Farmers control weeds by
breaking up the topsoil with a fork or some other imple-
ment that also aerates the soil. The crops whose yields
have been substantially improved this way include bar-
ley, durum wheat, maize, sorghum, tef, faba bean, and
lentils. Optimizing the spacing of plants proves benefi-
cial so long as the soil is well supplied with organic mat-
ter so that rainwater, dew and air can enter easily.

Extension of agroecological ideas to different
products and farming systems
Where this process on innovation will end cannot be
predicted. Growing numbers of farmers are gaining con-
fidence in their ability to produce ‘more from less’ and
to provide more adequately for their families’ food secur-
ity while enhancing the quality of their soil resources
and buffering their crops against the temperature and
precipitation stresses of climate change.

Unusual crops
There have been a number of unanticipated extrapola-
tions and extensions of SRI ideas and methods to quite
different kinds of agricultural production. Farmers who
understood the principles underlying SRI management
have adapted them, for example, to a root crop (tur-
meric), an entomological (insect) product (lac), and even
to animal husbandry (chickens) [22]. Through experi-
mentation, farmers have found that they could greatly
increase their output from existing resources by man-
aging these differently and better. Some of the changes
made in their production practices are ones that few re-
searchers would have been likely to imagine.

Smallholder diversification
While achieving greater productivity from individual
crops or commodities is important for farming house-
holds, families depend for their wellbeing on their whole
farming systems, not just on any one component of
these systems. In Cambodia, farmers working with the
NGO CEDAC have very small landholdings, on average
about 0.66 ha.

With CEDAC encouragement, several thousand farmers
have started capitalizing on the productivity gains that SRI
management is bringing to their paddy fields by reorganiz-
ing, diversifying, and intensifying their rice-based farming
systems. With their previous paddy yields now doubled or
tripled, farmers can take 30% to 50% of their paddy land
out of rice production, as they are able to meet or exceed
their households’ staple food needs by using SRI methods
on their remaining rice area [45].

The first step for such diversification is constructing a
pond, about 10 × 15 m in area and 2 to 3 m deep, which
can capture water during the rainy season and store it
into the dry season. Fish, eels, frogs, and other plants
and animals are raised in the pond and canals which
provide water and liquid manure to make the rest of the
farmed area more productive. A great variety of crops
and livestock are grown on the non-paddy area: toma-
toes, eggplants, watermelons, cucumbers, pumpkins;
mung beans and other legumes; bananas, papayas, and
other fruit trees; sugarcane, cassava, and maize in upland
areas; as well as chickens, pigs, and/or rabbits.

functions. During the early monsoon,

The ponds and canals in the rice fields serve a number
of
they help
farmers drain excess water from their rice fields, so that
young seedlings will not suffer from too-high water
levels in the fields. During short dry periods within the
monsoon, water from the pond can be used to irrigate
the young rice plants so they withstand water stress.
Frogs and fishes living in the ponds and canals help to
control insects during the growing season.

During the late monsoon, when the rice plants start to
flower, the frogs and fish move from the ponds into the
rice fields, where they find plenty of food. During the
grain-filling phase, the fields are kept flooded with just a
few centimeters of water to ensure sufficient supply for
producing full grains. When the crop is ripe, the fields
are drained for easier harvesting of the rice, and fish and
frogs can also be harvested at the same time, augment-
ing household income and food supply.

Details on cropping, land use, and investments made
from the experience of five innovative but representative
farmers are given in [45]. They have, on average, tripled
their household incomes, with annual cash earnings ris-
ing from $200 to $600. The average capital investment
required was only about $300, made incrementally over
several years with no borrowing needed.

Apart from these monetary gains, Cambodian farmers
appreciate the diversification and enrichment of their
household diets which this redesign of their farming sys-
tems makes possible. They also appreciate having mul-
tiple sources of income that bring in at least some cash
income throughout the year. Household food security no
longer depends just on their seasonal rice harvests with
one or two surges of income during the year. This in-
tensification also creates paid employment opportunities
in rural areas that make migration to urban areas less
necessary.

Farmers following agroecological management further
report improvements in their soil and water quality, with
less build-up of synthetic chemicals. Such a diversifica-
tion based on farming system intensification will not
meet the needs of all rural households; for example, it
requires at least some access to irrigation or sufficient

Abraham et al. Agriculture & Food Security 2014, 3:4

Page 10 of 12

rainfall to fill ponds. But the productivity of rather small
extents of land can be greatly enhanced by this kind of
intensified agroecological management.

Larger-scale, mechanized operations
Agroecological innovations need not be limited to small-
holder farming. In Pakistan’s Punjab province, a large
farmer who is also a businessman, inventor, and philan-
thropist has developed several machines that implement
SRI principles in conjunction with conservation agricul-
ture (CA) and organic soil improvement, aiming to build
up soil fertility and to minimize external energy and
agrochemical inputs over time [46].

Initially, SRI methods were adapted to produce rice on
permanent raised beds formed by a specially-designed
machine on a laser-leveled, 8-hectare ‘test plot.’ Irriga-
tion/drainage ditches were formed in between the beds
to establish furrow irrigation for reducing water applica-
tions. Mechanized transplanting, precise spacing of plants,
precision applications of compost and some inorganic
fertilizer, plus fully-mechanized weeding to aerate the top-
soil between plants thoroughly, all contributed to a paddy
yield of 12 tonnes/ha. This yield was produced with 70%
reductions in both water and labor, compared to the usual
amounts of water and labor utilized for growing rice in
the region [46].

Now this technology is being adapted to many other
crops. This mechanized farming system, following CA
principles, including no tillage after the beds have been
formed, rotates various crops with rice or with each
other. These crops include wheat (with yield doubling to
7.3 tonnes/ha), carrots (tripled production), maize, cot-
ton, sunflower, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Large-
scale mechanized cultivation on permanent raised beds
together with furrow irrigation using siphons reduces
both water requirements and energy costs. Following
SRI principles is saving labor, cost, and water and build-
ing up soil fertility. These demonstrations indicate that
SCI presents opportunities for large-scale farmers also to
capitalize on the biological dynamics discussed here.
Starting in 2013, USDA and USAID programs
in
Pakistan have sponsored farmer field days for potato
production where SCI innovations are applied.

Conclusions
This review indicates that SCI is an evolving phenomenon,
still a work in progress [47], not yet getting much atten-
tion in scientific journals. Some of the data reported here
are from controlled, even replicated trials; but much sys-
tematic research remains to be done. Most of the data and
reports cited here are available online, presented not as
definitive results but as observations and measurements
that should attract the interest of researchers as well as

anyone concerned with improving agriculture and food
security in the world.

The data reported here and summarized in annexes to
[22] show considerable variability across crops and
countries, but generally speaking, there has been more
than a doubling of yields by using modified methods of
crop management. Crop-wise, the typical yield increases
range from 60% for sugarcane to 180% for wheat.

In economic terms, the per-hectare costs of produc-
tion with such intensification go up on average by about
50%. But with the increases in yield, the costs of produc-
tion per unit of crop output decline, on average by 40%
across the crops for which detailed cost and return data
farmers’ net income per
are available. Consequently,
hectare from these crops is usually considerably more
than doubled.

While the data presented here are not complete or
standardized enough for strong scientific conclusions,
the patterns of yield and profitability improvement are
dramatic and consistent enough to have attracted the
attention of already millions of farmers and also of pol-
icy makers, particularly in Ethiopia and Bihar state of
India [14,15].

This information has been assembled to bring these
opportunities to the attention of a wider audience that is
concerned with improving agricultural production and
food security, and one that also desires to conserve en-
vironmental resources and help farmers cope with in-
creasing climatic stresses now and in the future.

Finding explanations for the evident improvements in
soil/plant
interaction and crop performance presents
both challenges and opportunities to the scientific com-
munity. As no harm is seen from such modifications of
crop management practices, their experimentation, dem-
onstration, and adaptation represents an opportunity
available for both farmers and the agencies and profes-
sionals working with them for raising farmers’ yields and
incomes in ways that are environmentally benign.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests, having no
financial stake in any of the innovations reported. They have, of course,
personal and professional interests in the success of such innovations for
increasing farmers’ agricultural production and households’ food security.

Authors’ contributions
The authors contributed written material, data, and pictures from their
respective involvements with SCI in different countries. BA supported
initiatives on SCI practices for finger millet and lac, building on PRADAN’s SRI
work with rice in Jharkhand state of India. HA and SE oversaw and facilitated
work with farmers in several provinces in Ethiopia on finger millet, tef, and
other crops ‘planting with space’. TB undertook the first trials with SRI
methods for tef in Ethiopia and continues to oversee a national government
program on STI. BG supported the extension of SRI concepts and practices
to sugarcane (SSI) in India after working with SRI as director of a WWF-ICRISAT
dialogue project on food, water, and environment in Hyderabad. RBK worked
with SWI for wheat as well as SRI for rice in the Far Western region of
Nepal under an EU-funded food security project implemented by FAO.
YSK introduced SRI for rice in Cambodia as director of CEDAC and then

encouraged farmers to develop their own diversified-intensified farming
systems in that country. DS has worked with farmers in northern India to adapt
SRI ideas for wheat, finger millet, maize, legumes, and other crops through the
People’s Science Institute based in Dehradun. AS developed custom-made
machinery as a private individual to reduce labor and save water while
raising the yields first of rice and then wheat, legumes, cotton, sunflower,
and other crops on raised beds with no tillage in the Punjab province of
Pakistan. ES assisted farmers in the Timbuktu region of Mali on behalf of Africare
to adapt SRI methods for wheat SWI. NU has visited and/or corresponded
extensively with all the other contributors, consolidating their knowledge
and experience into a monograph [22] and this review article. He has also
made field visits in India to learn about the farmer-initiated finger-millet
SCI known as Guli Vidhana in Karnataka, and SCI applications for turmeric
in Tamil Nadu and lac in Jharkhand states, and in Cambodia to see farmer
innovations with ‘diversified intensification’. AV introduced SRI and then
SWI in Bihar state of India, and then helped to extend applications of this
experience to mustard, finger millet, legumes, and numerous vegetable

The authors gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and the innovative
efforts and ideas of countless persons, both farmers and institutional
colleagues in our respective countries. We acknowledge the assistance of Dr
Rena Perez for introduction of SSI for sugarcane into Cuba. Almost all of the
work reported here has been ‘bootstrapped’ as part of ongoing
development programs and activities, without any dedicated funding as
with a conventional research project.
Resources have been utilized from many sources that should be
acknowledged: Africare and the Better U Foundation (Mali/wheat); FAO and
the European Union’s Food Facility Project (Nepal/ wheat); India’s National
Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust
(India/wheat and other crops); Oxfam America and the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (Ethiopia/tef); the Swedish Society of Nature Conservation
(Ethiopia/ planting with space); the Worldwide Fund for Nature-ICRISAT
dialogue project on food, water, and environment (India/sugar); and the
World Bank/IDA (India/wheat and other crops in Bihar).
