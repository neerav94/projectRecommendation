I. INTRODUCTION 

      The  LPG  or  propane  which  is  flammable  mixture  of 
hydrocarbon  gases  used  as  fuel  in  many  applications  like 
homes,  hostels,  industries,  automobiles,  vehicles  because  of 
its  desirable  properties  which  include  high  calorific  value, 
which  produce  the  less  smoke,  produces  less  soot,  and  does 
not  cause  much  harm  to  the  environment.  Natural  gas  is 
another  widely  used  fuel  in  homes.  Both  gases  burns  to 
produce  clean  energy,  however  there  is  a  serious  problem 
about their leakage in the air. The gases being heavier than air 
do  not  disperse  easily  and  may  lead  to  suffocation  when 
inhaled  also  when  gas  leakage  into  the  air  may  lead  to 
explosion.  Due  to  the  explosion  of  LPgas  the  number  of 
deaths  has  been  increased  in  recent  years.  To  avoid  this 
problem  there  is  a  need  for  a  system  to  detect  and  also 
prevent leakage of LPG. Gas leak detection is the process of 
identifying  potentially  hazardous  gas  leaks  by  means  of 
various  sensors.  These  sensors  usually  employ  an  audible 
alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected. 
security of a home and industries when the user is away from 

the  place  and  industrial  areas  away  from  cities  if  fire  occurs 
during  night  this  system  sends  the  location  details  by  means 
of  sending  longitude  and  latitude  angles  by  using  GPS  and 
sends  messages to  fire  station, police station ,and predefined 
numbers.  At  the  fire  and  police  station  received  information 
has  a  destination  address  to  find  route  in  google  map  from 
fire and police station. This system uses fire sensors and gas 
sensors  that  finds  fire  occurred  or  not  if  occurred  it  sends 
control  signal 
to  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller 
receives  the  GPS  information  by  GPS  modem  connected  to 
the  microcontroller  and  it  sends  the  message  using  GSM 
modem  containing  information  of  longitude  and  latitude 
angle  calculated  by  GPS.  The  microcontroller  also  sends 
signal to the alarm and signal to the emergency window that 
opens by means of actuators.

passive  transponder.  Other  types  have  a  local  power  source 
such as a battery and may operate at hundreds of meters from 
the reader. There are two Parts in RFID, they are reader and 
tag.  

A. Passive Reader Active Tag (PRAT) 
    System  has  a  passive  reader  which  only  receives  radio 
signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The 
reception  range  of  a  PRAT  system  reader  can  be  adjusted

B. Power Supply Circuit  
     The  main  building  block  of  any  electronic  system  is  the 
power  supply  to  provide  required  power  for  their  operation. 
For  the  microcontroller  keyboard,  LCD,  GSM,  +5V  are 
required  &  for  driving  buzzer  +12V  is  required.  The  power 
supply  provides  regulated  output  of  +5V  &  non-regulated 
output  of  +12V.  The  hardware  part  consists  of 
the 
components  and  the  sensors  used  in  the  system.  This  part 
mainly collects the status of the sensors and stores it into the 
micro controller„s EEPROM. 

C. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
      LCD  (Liquid  Crystal  Display)  screen  is  an  electronic 
display module and find a wide range of applications. A 16x2 
LCD  display  is  very  basic  module  and  is  very  commonly 
used  in  various  devices  and  circuits.  These  modules  are 
preferred  over seven  segments and  other  multi  segment 
LEDs.  The  reasons  being:  LCDs  are  economical;  easily 
programmable;  have  no  limitation  of  displaying  special  & 
even custom 
segments),  
animations  and  so  on.  A 16x2  LCD means  it  can  display  16 
characters  per  line  and  there  are  2  such  lines.  In  this  LCD 
each character is displayed in 5x7 pixel matrix.

D. DC Motor 
    For the Closing the ATM door, we are using DC motors. It 
is  operated  by  12VDC  power  supply.  In  any  electric  motor, 
operation  is  based  on  simple  electromagnetism.  A  current 
carrying  conductor  generates  a  magnetic  field;  when  and  to 
the  strength  of  the  external  magnetic  field.  Here  we  are 
placing  DC  Motor  for  closing  the  ATM  door  while  thieves 
are trying to broken the ATM machine. 

E. L293D Driver 
      L293D  is  a  dual H-bridge motor  driver  integrated  circuit 
(IC). Motor drivers act as current amplifiers since they take a 
low-current  control  signal  and  provide  a  higher-current 
signal. This higher current signal is used to drive the motors. 
L293D  contains  two  inbuilt  H-bridge  driver  circuits.  In  its 
common  mode  of  operation,  two  DC  motors  can  be  driven 
simultaneously, both in forward and reverse direction. 

Features: 

 

  Wide Supply-Voltage Range: 4.5 V to 36 V.

  Peak Output Current 2 A Per Channel (1.2 A for L293D). 

F. Buzzer 
       Piezo  buzzer is  an  electronic  device  commonly  used  to 
produce  sound.  Light  weight,  simple  construction  and  low 
price  make  it  usable  in  various  applications  like  car/truck 
reversing indicator, computers, call bells etc. Piezo buzzer is 
based on the inverse principle of piezo electricity discovered 
in  1880  by  Jacques  and  Pierre  Curie. It  is  the  phenomena  of 
generating electricity when mechanical pressure is applied to 
certain  materials  and  the  vice  versa  is  also  true.  Such 
materials  are  called  piezo  electric  materials.  Here  in  our 
project  buzzer  is  used  to  produce  sound  whenever  robbery

I. INTRODUCTION 

      The  LPG  or  propane  which  is  flammable  mixture  of 
hydrocarbon  gases  used  as  fuel  in  many  applications  like 
homes,  hostels,  industries,  automobiles,  vehicles  because  of 
its  desirable  properties  which  include  high  calorific  value, 
which  produce  the  less  smoke,  produces  less  soot,  and  does 
not  cause  much  harm  to  the  environment.  Natural  gas  is 
another  widely  used  fuel  in  homes.  Both  gases  burns  to 
produce  clean  energy,  however  there  is  a  serious  problem 
about their leakage in the air. The gases being heavier than air 
do  not  disperse  easily  and  may  lead  to  suffocation  when 
inhaled  also  when  gas  leakage  into  the  air  may  lead  to 
explosion.  Due  to  the  explosion  of  LPgas  the  number  of 
deaths  has  been  increased  in  recent  years.  To  avoid  this 
problem  there  is  a  need  for  a  system  to  detect  and  also 
prevent leakage of LPG. Gas leak detection is the process of 
identifying  potentially  hazardous  gas  leaks  by  means  of 
various  sensors.  These  sensors  usually  employ  an  audible 
alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected. 
security of a home and industries when the user is away from 

the  place  and  industrial  areas  away  from  cities  if  fire  occurs 
during  night  this  system  sends  the  location  details  by  means 
of  sending  longitude  and  latitude  angles  by  using  GPS  and 
sends  messages to  fire  station, police station ,and predefined 
numbers.  At  the  fire  and  police  station  received  information 
has  a  destination  address  to  find  route  in  google  map  from 
fire and police station. This system uses fire sensors and gas 
sensors  that  finds  fire  occurred  or  not  if  occurred  it  sends 
control  signal 
to  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller 
receives  the  GPS  information  by  GPS  modem  connected  to 
the  microcontroller  and  it  sends  the  message  using  GSM 
modem  containing  information  of  longitude  and  latitude 
angle  calculated  by  GPS.  The  microcontroller  also  sends 
signal to the alarm and signal to the emergency window that 
opens by means of actuators.

B. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) 
     The  GSM  which  is  one  of  the  representative  wireless 
networks which has low-power, low-cost and convenience to 
use.  Global  System  for  Mobile  Communications  originally 
from Groupe Special Mobile is the most popular standard for 
mobile 
the  world.  The  GSM 
Association,  its  promoting  industry  trade  organization  of 
mobile phone carriers and manufacturers, estimates that 80% 
of  the  global  mobile  market  uses  the  standard.  GSM  is  used 
by over 1.5 billion people across more than 212 countries and 
territories.  A  GSM  modem  is  a  specialized  type  of  modem 
which accepts a SIM card, and operates over a subscription to 
a mobile operator, just like a mobile phone. From the mobile 
operator perspective, a GSM modem looks just like a mobile 
phone. When a GSM modem is connected to a computer, this 
allows the computer to use the GSM modem to communicate 
over the mobile network.  

Technical  Details:  Most  GSM  networks  operate  in  the  900 
MHz  or  1800  MHz  bands.  Some  countries  in  the  Americas 
(including  the  United  States  and  Canada)  use  the  850  MHz 
and  1900  MHz  bands  because  the  900  and  1800  MHz 
frequency  bands  were  already  allocated.  The  rarer  400  and 
450  MHz  frequency  bands  are  assigned  in  some  countries, 
notably Scandinavia, where these frequencies were In the 900 
MHz  band  the  uplink  frequency  band  is  890-915  MHz,  and 
the  downlink  frequency  band  is  935-960  MHz  this  25  MHz 
bandwidth is subdivided into 124 carrier frequency channels, 
each spaced 200 kHz apart.
