 INTRODUCTION 

I. 

Electronic tracking of products is a widely growing field now-a-days. Conventional optical barcodes are the 
most  familiar  one.  The  barcodes  are  widespread  due  to  their  very  low  cost  and  ease  of  fabrication.  They  are 
impossible to read if there is any obstruction between the reading device and the barcode. In addition to that, they 
are  limited,  however,  by  their  short  range  of  reading.  When  reading  a  barcode,  the  orientation  of  the  reading 
device relative to the barcode also causes problem. If the reading device is not properly aligned or is held at an 
improper  angle,  the  encoded  information  cannot  be  read.  As  a  result  a  human  operator  is  required  for  that 
individual reading operation. Another very familiar tracking technique is the magnetic strips, which are widely 
employed in business to perform several identification purposes. Magnetic strips are quite similar to Smart Cards 
in terms of usage. In reality, a contact based Smart Card, or magnetic strip requires the insertion of the card into a 
contact reader. In the specific case of magnetic strips reader, the mechanical part is very important which leads to 
a dramatic increase of the reader production and maintenance costs. It is why the global cost of this identification 
technique  remains  high.  However  the  inherent  limitations  of  barcodes  and  magnetic  strips–  costs  and  not 
contactless – have prevented their use in a wide range of applications for machine-readable data storage. The 
above  hurdles  may  be  overcome  by  reading  another  technology  based  on  radio  waves.  Radio  frequency 
IDentification (RFID) is an automatic technique of capturing information coming from a label containing the data 
by remote radio reading.  

The label consists of a microchip and an antenna which ensures the communication with a dedicated reader. 
Recently, this technology has become inevitable for item identification and tracking applications and also very 
popular as a device for storing and transmitting information. Most RFID tags present a longer reliable range than 
barcodes. Even though rapid growth is predicted by many exploratory studies, its progress is slowed down due to 
several economical, technological and social factors like the size and high cost of the tags, limitation of frequency 
band, range of reading, mobility of the object, lack of safety and reliability of the information contained within 
RFID chip, and difficulties in recycling tags [1]. Because applications using RFID present various constraints, 
each tag design is dedicated for a specific application. And it can be found many variant of RFID depending on 
several parameters. 

The most significant parameters that best describe a RFID tag are the way of empowering, the reading range, 
the data processing, the read/write capability and the protocol used. For realizing low cost RFID tags, one of the 
most promising techniques is printable chipless RFID tags [2]. Benefit from the removal of chips, the price of a 
unit chipless tag is expected to be significantly lower than the chip based tags. Moreover, incorporating high-
throughput printing techniques and low cost paper substrates, these chipless tags can be massively produced at 
extremely low expense. Indeed, the major change of this technology is the absence of any chip IC connected to 
antenna. For these reasons, the realization of chipless tags constitutes a very attractive solution for specific or 
everyday  life  applications.  The  principle  of  the  information  encoding,  which  consists  in  encoding  the 
identification number of the tag, is based on the generation of a specific temporal or frequency footprint. This 
temporal footprint can be obtained by the generation of echoes due to the reflection of the incidental pulse. In the 
frequency domain, one can characterize the spectrum of the backscattering pulse.

There have been many researches on chipless RFID in the past but extensive research has not been done yet to 
tag  documents  and  large  volume  of  paper/  plastic-based  items  such  as  intelligence  agency  reports,  financial 
securities,  banknotes,  postage  stamps,  tickets,  and  envelopes  due  to  the  relatively  high  price  of  the  tag  when 
compared to the price of the tagged item and the presence of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 
chip. In this project an idea of using a mixture of various chemical components in the paper or polymer-based 
items will be developed. The chemical mixture can either be embedded or printed and form a invisible binary 
code in a particular point/ end of that item. Thus the reliable identification and saving of cost can be assured. 

II.  METHODOLOGIES 

The  proposed  chipless  RFID  system  will  have  spectral  (frequency)  signature-based  chipless  passive  RFID 
transponders/ tags, so the transponders will not need any power supply for its operation [3]. A system will be 
developed  which  will  randomly  embed  tiny  fibers  (with  different  chemical  composition)  in  paper  or  print 
invisible  chemical  mixture  of  "nanometric"  materials  (tiny  particles  of  chemicals  with  varying  degrees  of 
magnetism) that will resonate when bombarded with electro-magnetic waves from a reader. Each chemical will 
emit its own distinct radio frequency that will be picked up by the reader, and all frequencies that will be emitted 
by  a  specific  mix  of  different  chemicals  are  then  interpreted  as  a  binary  number.  If  the  system  uses  up  to  n 
different chemicals, each chemical will be assigned its own position in n-digit binary number. 

For example, the presence of a chemical component is defined by 1 and absence by 0. If chemicals P, Q, R 
and S are assigned to the first, second, third and fourth positions in the n-digit number, then a mixture consisting 
of P and R will represent the binary number 1010 followed by (n-4) zeros. Suppose for banknotes, each banknote 
will possess a unique ID and it will be done by the printer or the manufacturer applying a specific chemical mix 
corresponding to the ID being printed. Once a banknote’s ID code is printed, the system will be able to scan the 
code from a certain distance, without a line-of-sight requirement. 

Thus the chemically embedded tag encodes data in the frequency spectrum hence having a unique binary ID 
or “spectral signature”. The spectral signature is obtained by interrogating the transponder by a multi-frequency 
signal  and  observing  which  frequencies  are  attenuated  [4].  Depending  on  the  attenuation,  an  alarm  can  be 
generated when bit errors will be detected. RFID reader sends out a multi-frequency interrogation signal which 
might  be  higher  than  the  frequencies  commonly  used  by  wireless  LANs  and  handheld  computers  [5].  The 
receiving  and  transmitting  tag  antennas  should  be  cross-polarized  to  minimize  the  interference  between  the 
interrogating signal and the retransmitted encoded signal of the spectral signature. 

Finally, when someone will bear/submit the paper/plastic based items then the reader will read the RFIDs 
without  being  in  line-of-sight.  Next,  the  algorithm  programmed  in  a  connected  computer  will  compare  the 
embedded ID with the database (kept in the PC). If the any of the IDs does not match with the database then it 
will  give  alarm  and  vice  versa.  Thus,  a  system  will  be  able  to  detect  any  forgery.  The  whole  process  can  be 
showed in following flow chart:

There have been many researches on chipless RFID in the past but extensive research has not been done yet to

Thus the chemically embedded tag encodes data in the frequency spectrum hence having a unique binary ID

Readers can also be placed inside copy machines to prevent unauthorized copying. One application would be 
to require that any document printed on such special paper be photocopied onto the same type of paper. That way, 
an  intelligence  agency,  financial  institutions  like  banks  or  even  a  company  wanting  to  protect  its  intellectual 
property from counterfeiting could install readers at building exits to prevent unauthorized people from copying 
documents and leaving the building with them. One of the big advantages will be that the tag can be printed on 
just about anything. Therefore, it will not complicate the process of producing the product and the printing can be 
done in invisible mode for extra security. 

Additional work may be concentrated on improving the resonators as well as investigating the phase of the 

received signal encoded by the tag as phase is more resistive to the effects of noise and other interferences. 

III.  PREDICTED RESULTS 

The proposed methodology will be applied to any of the paper/ plastic based items, such as any bank notes, 
low cost and secured paper/ polymer-based items. The project concerns design and implementation of passive 
devices  design,  antennas,  proper  frequency  band,  analog  and  digital  electronic  design,  signal  processing 
algorithm, middleware, and finally, implementing them in FPGAs and micro-controllers for the RFID reader. The 
performance of the proposed methodology will be judged in terms the ability to extract the spectrum phase to 
decode the transponders’ ID and to detect bit errors. If any item gives alarm, repeated examination can be done to 
ensure whether it is giving false alarms or not. The possible pitfall is, in environments where there are lots of 
metallic or water-filled objects, however, readers may not be able to scan the codes printed because metal reflects 
RF signals and water absorbs them, which are also the major constraints for conventional RFID systems.  

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Though this is a theoretical idea, there are few question that need to be asked like how many chemicals may be 
used, how the right ones can be chosen and which combinations will give accurate results. Besides ample study 
should be done to find out the operating frequencies that the reader will use so that the frequencies will not 
create  interference  with  other  existing  signals.  For  a  successful  operation,  a  frequency  range  needs  to  be 
specified too. Extreme research can be done to find out the distance from which the system will be able to detect 
the RFID tags and how this can be increased without compromising the accuracy. Furthermore the sensitivity of 
the RFID reader needs to be studied and the false alarms should be minimized. This paper doesn’t give any 
solution to find these answers but it is just a mere proposal which can increase the potentiality of using chipless 
RFID tags in paper or plastic based items to increase its security which might come handy for many countries, 
agencies and/or personnel.
