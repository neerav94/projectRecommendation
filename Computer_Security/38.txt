system.According to the situation that not getting better, but getting worse, people need some protection 
system that can protect their properties better. This security system exist to answer the need. This security 
system work based on the ability to receive signal from port LPT1 of printer and the ability to use modem 
as  comunication device.  Port  LPT1  will  detect  the  signal  that sent  from  infrared  receptor  through  status 
register. If computer detect any signal then computer will send short messages to the recipient, police or 
user by phone number that the data taken from data base, so police can immediately come and secure the 
place.

initially deemed inadequate, it gives birth to a new 
standard in parallel terminal capable of handling up 
to 1 Mbps data transfer, cable length can reach 10 
meters,  and  can  be  two-way  communication  (bi-

Passive Infrared (PIR) detectors are used to sense 
thermal  energy  emitted  by  the  human  body.  By 
detecting emitted rather than reflected energy, the 
device performance is less affected by the ambient 
lighting  condition.  Additionally,  due 
the 
generally  lower  temperature  and  emissivity  of  the 
surroundings,  the  target-to-background  contrast  is 
much better than with visible light cameras.  
The  signal  is  analysed  and  a  decision  about  the

is  made.  The

producing  four  possible  direction  outputs.  The 
captured sample data shows that there is sufficient 
information  in  the  signal  that  can  lead  to  a  much 
better direction resolution [1]. 
 
3  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1  The system developed  

Security  system  to  be  developed  here  is  a  pilot 
based  FBUS 
systems 
security 
(prototype) 
technology,  especially 
the  SMS  gateway  and 
parallel  terminal  programming.  The  program  will 
display information to the user via SMS gateway if 
infrared 
are 
interruptions.  This  system  aims  to  activate  the 
alarm (warning) and inform the user if the infrared 
sensor disconnected receives infrared signal.  
 
3.2  Limitation System

there 

Limitations in the security system is: 
  
1.  This  system  provides  information  to  users 
using SMS via mobile phone carried by the 
user wherever the user is located while in the 
coverage area, enable and disable some or all 
of  the  infrared  sensor  using  either  SMS  or 
using a computer, or any sensor information 
current through SMS. 
 

2.  Since this system was developed and is still a 
small-scale  pilot, 
then  place  could  be 
implemented within the system is still home, 
where  sensors  are  still  limited  to  5  sensors 
used.  
 

3.  Since the the system is still in prototype form 
(pilot),  then  infrared  sensor  used  is  an 
infrared  sensor  at  close  range  (2-3  m).  In  a 
real  situation  that  is  used  is  the  infrared 
sensor  which  is  amplified  and  can  receive 
signals from a distance of up to 20 meters.  

 

3.3  Hardware 

The hardware used here is divided into 3 modules 

(part), ie  

  

1.  One unit of PC (Personal Computer) that 

manages all the security systems work. 
 
that  continuously 
Infrared 
emits  infrared  light  and  receiver  (sensor)

Through  this  security  system,  besides  the  cost  is 
relatively cheaper, is also a higher level of security

2.1  Parallel Terminal 

At first the parallel terminals introduced by IBM 
as an alternative to the slower serial terminal. The 
function of parallel  terminals  initially  was just  the 
computer communicate with the printer. Because of 
the  growth  will  be  increasing  external  devices, 
communication between computers and equipment 
increased another party. But the development of the 
faster  processor,  the  ability  of  parallel  terminals 
initially deemed inadequate, it gives birth to a new 
standard in parallel terminal capable of handling up 
to 1 Mbps data transfer, cable length can reach 10 
meters,  and  can  be  two-way  communication  (bi-
directional) [2].

Passive Infrared (PIR) detectors are used to sense 
thermal  energy  emitted  by  the  human  body.  By 
detecting emitted rather than reflected energy, the 
device performance is less affected by the ambient 
lighting  condition.  Additionally,  due 
the 
generally  lower  temperature  and  emissivity  of  the 
surroundings,  the  target-to-background  contrast  is 
much better than with visible light cameras.  
The  signal  is  analysed  and  a  decision  about  the 
motion

is  made.  The

better direction resolution [1].

parallel  terminal  programming.  The  program  will 
display information to the user via SMS gateway if

Limitations in the security system is: 
  
1.  This  system  provides  information  to  users 
using SMS via mobile phone carried by the 
user wherever the user is located while in the 
coverage area, enable and disable some or all 
of  the  infrared  sensor  using  either  SMS  or 
using a computer, or any sensor information 
current through SMS. 
 

2.  Since this system was developed and is still a 
small-scale  pilot, 
then  place  could  be 
implemented within the system is still home, 
where  sensors  are  still  limited  to  5  sensors 
used.  
 

3.  Since the the system is still in prototype form 
(pilot),  then  infrared  sensor  used  is  an 
infrared  sensor  at  close  range  (2-3  m).  In  a 
real  situation  that  is  used  is  the  infrared 
sensor  which  is  amplified  and  can  receive 
signals from a distance of up to 20 meters.  

 

3.3  Hardware

3.4  Software 

to  use 

The software  was developed  using Visual  Basic 
version  6.0.  The  author  chose 
this 
programming  language  because  a  programming 
language  in  addition  to  the  already  common  and 
more used, also systematic use is more easily [3]. 
Library  used  herein  are  MFBUS15.OCX,  This 
ActiveX  provides  facilities  that  are  very  useful  in 
developing  the  security  system,  and  is  also  a 
freeware  so  there  is  no  cost  to  get  it.  ActiveX 
capabilities are [5]: 
 

1.  Send and receive SMS. 
2.  Manage logo operator. 
4.  Manage date and time. 
5.  Manage StartUp text. 
6.  Manage Phonebook. 
7.  Status ponsel. 
8.  Dial / DTMF 
9.  Monitoring features. 

Of  the  8  functions  that  can  be  used,  the  author 
uses  only  the  first  function,  which  sends  and 
receives SMS.

Essentially  all  of  the  pins  on  the  parallel 
terminals  will  provide  value  "1"  (high)  as  the 
default. The author took the insert to create a series 
that  will  provide  value  to  "0"  on  the  status  of  the 
terminal which is located on the 379H [2].  

Data on the status of the terminal read 8 bits, so 

that the reading becomes:

ABSTRACT 

 
 

 
 

 

The  growing  of  technology  in  this  information  age  is  very  fast  and  force  us  to  compete  to  get  more 
information, that information is power. Computer system and hand phone technology that has grow so fast 
can  be  used  to  get  information  about  anything  at  any  place,  include  if  we  aplicate  it  to  house  security 
system.According to the situation that not getting better, but getting worse, people need some protection 
system that can protect their properties better. This security system exist to answer the need. This security 
system work based on the ability to receive signal from port LPT1 of printer and the ability to use modem 
as  comunication device.  Port  LPT1  will  detect  the  signal  that sent  from  infrared  receptor  through  status 
register. If computer detect any signal then computer will send short messages to the recipient, police or 
user by phone number that the data taken from data base, so police can immediately come and secure the 
place.

INTRODUCTION  

Advances  in  technology  in  this  information  era 
very rapidly. This makes the human must be fast in 
getting  the  information,  because  information  is 
power  forward.  Computer  technology  and  mobile 
phones are already highly developed can be used to 
obtain  information  about  any  and  everywhere, 
including when applied to house and shop security 
systems.

This  topic  adopted  lately  considering  the  crime 
rate  is  very  high,  and  disturbing  the  owners  of 
abandoned  house  or  shop  at  night  or  for  going 
home.  Many  people  are  willing  to  pay  a  premium 
for 
to  maintain  security 
through  security like  security forces. We  were  not 
only  cost  very  much,  but  its  security  system  was 
less than the  optimal. If a  robber  or  thief  came in 
large  numbers  or  with  a  deadly  weapon,  then  the 
security  unit  can  be  easily  overpowered.  In

3.4  Software 

to  use 

The software  was developed  using Visual  Basic 
version  6.0.  The  author  chose 
this 
programming  language  because  a  programming 
language  in  addition  to  the  already  common  and 
more used, also systematic use is more easily [3]. 
Library  used  herein  are  MFBUS15.OCX,  This 
ActiveX  provides  facilities  that  are  very  useful  in 
developing  the  security  system,  and  is  also  a 
freeware  so  there  is  no  cost  to  get  it.  ActiveX 
capabilities are [5]: 
 

1.  Send and receive SMS. 
2.  Manage logo operator. 
4.  Manage date and time. 
5.  Manage StartUp text. 
6.  Manage Phonebook. 
7.  Status ponsel. 
8.  Dial / DTMF 
9.  Monitoring features. 

Of  the  8  functions  that  can  be  used,  the  author 
uses  only  the  first  function,  which  sends  and 
receives SMS.

Parallel Terminal 

Fig. 2.  Schematic outline of the hardware 

Essentially  all  of  the  pins  on  the  parallel 
terminals  will  provide  value  "1"  (high)  as  the 
default. The author took the insert to create a series 
that  will  provide  value  to  "0"  on  the  status  of  the 
terminal which is located on the 379H [2].  

Data on the status of the terminal read 8 bits, so 

that the reading becomes:

Reading  of  data  by  default  is  "01111111"  or 
decimal value is equal to 127. If the received signal 
pin  6  low,  meaning  the  value  to  "00111111"  in 
binary or decimal is equal to 63, and so on [2]. 
  
3.5  System Design 

This system is used by various users from various 
backgrounds, therefore the design of the interface is 
made as easy as possible, as shown below.

Field  name  is  used  as  an  index  and  is  unique, 
given  the  scale  used  is  still  small  scale  so  that 
duplicate  names  could  be  said  not  happen.  The 
program  will  search  for  first  names corresponding 
to  the  names  of  the  txtnama,  then  after  the  meet 
then the record is deleted. 
 
4  CONCLUSION  
 

Based on system implementation and analysis of 
security  system  that  has  the  author  made,  then 
conclusion is: 

  
1.  This  security  system  has  been  able  to  meet 
the needs of consumers in the home security 
quickly.  

2.  This  security  system  also  can  minimize  the 
mistakes that often occur when using human 
power.  

3.  This security  system also had  to answer the 
needs of users  in terms of user friendliness. 
This  system  was  designed  as  simple  as 
possible  so  that  users  are  not  confused  to 
operate.
