1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z. 

Fig 3: Receiver collision in MANETS 

 

 
4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z. 

Fig 3: Receiver collision in MANETS 

 

 
4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

them  are  vulnerable  to  the  false  misbehavior  attack.  In  order  to  solves  not  only  receiver  collision  and  limited 

transmission power but also the false misbehavior problem to launch Secure IDS architecture. 

Fig 5: False Misbehavior in MANETS 

 

 

 

5.  Secure IDS description 

EAACK  is  consisted  of  three  major  parts,  namely,  ACK,  secure  ACK  (S-ACK),  and  misbehavior  report 

authentication  (MRA).  In  order  to  distinguish  different  packet  types  in  different  schemes  to  include  a  2-b  packet 

header in EAACK. According to the Internet draft of DSR [7], there is 6 b reserved in the DSR header. In EAACK, 

use 2 b of the 6 b to flag different types of packets. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver. 

In this secure IDS, It is assumed that the link between each node in the network is bidirectional. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver.

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z. 

Fig 3: Receiver collision in MANETS 

 

 
4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

them  are  vulnerable  to  the  false  misbehavior  attack.  In  order  to  solves  not  only  receiver  collision  and  limited 

transmission power but also the false misbehavior problem to launch Secure IDS architecture. 

Fig 5: False Misbehavior in MANETS 

 

 

 

5.  Secure IDS description 

EAACK  is  consisted  of  three  major  parts,  namely,  ACK,  secure  ACK  (S-ACK),  and  misbehavior  report 

authentication  (MRA).  In  order  to  distinguish  different  packet  types  in  different  schemes  to  include  a  2-b  packet 

header in EAACK. According to the Internet draft of DSR [7], there is 6 b reserved in the DSR header. In EAACK, 

use 2 b of the 6 b to flag different types of packets. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver. 

In this secure IDS, It is assumed that the link between each node in the network is bidirectional. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver.

5.1  ACK:  ACK  is  basically  an  end-to-end  ACK  IDS.  It  acts  as  a  part  of  the  hybrid  IDS  in  EAACK,  aiming  to 

reduce network overhead  when no network  misbehavior is  detected. Consider the scenario source node first sends 

out an ACK data packet to the destination node D. If all the intermediate nodes along the route between nodes S and

D  are  cooperative  and  node  D  successfully  receives  packet,  node  D  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK 

acknowledgment  packet  along  the  same  route  but  in  a  reverse  order.  Within  a  predefined  time  period,  if  node  S 

receives packet, then the packet transmission from node S to node D is successful. Otherwise, node S will switch to 

S-ACK mode by sending out an S-ACK data packet to detect the misbehaving nodes in the route. 

 

5.2  S-ACK:  It  is  an  improved  version  of  the  TWOACK  IDS  [6].  The  principle  is  to  let  every  three  consecutive 

nodes work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive nodes in the route, the third node is 

required to send  

an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the first node.

The  intention  of  introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or 

limited transmission power. 

 

5.3 MRA : Unlike the TWOACK IDS, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, EAACK 

requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to detect 

false  misbehavior.  The  MRA  field  is  designed  to  resolve  the  weakness  of  Watchdog  when  it  fails  to  detect 

misbehaving  nodes  with  the  presence  of  false  misbehavior.  The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by 

malicious attackers to falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. The core of MRA field is to authenticate whether 

the destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, 

the source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If 

there is no other that exists, the source node starts a DSR routing request to find another route. Due to the nature of 

MANETs, it is common to find out multiple routes between two nodes. When the destination node receives an MRA 

packet,  it  searches  its  local  knowledge  base  and  compares  if  the  reported  packet  was  received.  If  it  is  already 

received,  then  it  is  safe  to  conclude  that  this  is  a  false  misbehavior  report  and  whoever  generated  this  report  is 

marked as malicious. Otherwise, the misbehavior report is trusted and accepted. By the adoption of MRA scheme, 

EAACK is capable of detecting malicious nodes despite the existence of false misbehavior report.

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z.

4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

them  are  vulnerable  to  the  false  misbehavior  attack.  In  order  to  solves  not  only  receiver  collision  and  limited 

transmission power but also the false misbehavior problem to launch Secure IDS architecture.

5.  Secure IDS description 

EAACK  is  consisted  of  three  major  parts,  namely,  ACK,  secure  ACK  (S-ACK),  and  misbehavior  report 

authentication  (MRA).  In  order  to  distinguish  different  packet  types  in  different  schemes  to  include  a  2-b  packet 

header in EAACK. According to the Internet draft of DSR [7], there is 6 b reserved in the DSR header. In EAACK, 

use 2 b of the 6 b to flag different types of packets. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver. 

In this secure IDS, It is assumed that the link between each node in the network is bidirectional. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver.

5.1  ACK:  ACK  is  basically  an  end-to-end  ACK  IDS.  It  acts  as  a  part  of  the  hybrid  IDS  in  EAACK,  aiming  to 

reduce network overhead  when no network  misbehavior is  detected. Consider the scenario source node first sends 

out an ACK data packet to the destination node D. If all the intermediate nodes along the route between nodes S and

D  are  cooperative  and  node  D  successfully  receives  packet,  node  D  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK 

acknowledgment  packet  along  the  same  route  but  in  a  reverse  order.  Within  a  predefined  time  period,  if  node  S 

receives packet, then the packet transmission from node S to node D is successful. Otherwise, node S will switch to 

S-ACK mode by sending out an S-ACK data packet to detect the misbehaving nodes in the route. 

 

5.2  S-ACK:  It  is  an  improved  version  of  the  TWOACK  IDS  [6].  The  principle  is  to  let  every  three  consecutive 

nodes work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive nodes in the route, the third node is 

required to send  

an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the first node.

The  intention  of  introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or 

limited transmission power. 

 

5.3 MRA : Unlike the TWOACK IDS, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, EAACK 

requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to detect 

false  misbehavior.  The  MRA  field  is  designed  to  resolve  the  weakness  of  Watchdog  when  it  fails  to  detect 

misbehaving  nodes  with  the  presence  of  false  misbehavior.  The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by 

malicious attackers to falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. The core of MRA field is to authenticate whether 

the destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, 

the source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If 

there is no other that exists, the source node starts a DSR routing request to find another route. Due to the nature of 

MANETs, it is common to find out multiple routes between two nodes. When the destination node receives an MRA 

packet,  it  searches  its  local  knowledge  base  and  compares  if  the  reported  packet  was  received.  If  it  is  already 

received,  then  it  is  safe  to  conclude  that  this  is  a  false  misbehavior  report  and  whoever  generated  this  report  is 

marked as malicious. Otherwise, the misbehavior report is trusted and accepted. By the adoption of MRA scheme, 

EAACK is capable of detecting malicious nodes despite the existence of false misbehavior report.

5.4  Digital Signature 

As discussed before, EAACK is an acknowledgment-based IDS. All three parts of EAACK, namely, ACK, S-ACK, 

and  MRA,  are  acknowledgment-based  detection  schemes.  They  all  rely  on  acknowledgment  packets  to  detect 

misbehaviors in the network. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that all acknowledgment packets in EAACK 

are authentic and untainted. Otherwise, if the attackers are smart enough to forge acknowledgment packets, all of the 

three  schemes  will  be  vulnerable.  Hybrid  cryptography  technique  Diffie  Hellman  key  exchange  algorithm  is  used 

reduce the network overhead.

6.  CONCLUSION 

Intrusion- Detection Systems (IDS) for discovering malicious nodes and attacks on MANETs is presented. Due to 

some  special  characteristics  of  MANETs,  prevention  mechanisms  alone  are  not  adequate  to  manage  the  secure 

networks. In this case detection should be focused as another part before an attacker can damage the structure of the 

system. Secure IDS named EAACK protocol specially designed for MANETs and in future it is required to compare 

against other popular mechanisms. Security is major part in MANETS, hybrid architecture will tackle the issue in an 

efficient manner. This way we can better preserve battery and memory space of mobile nodes.

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior.

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z. 

Fig 3: Receiver collision in MANETS 

 

 
4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

them  are  vulnerable  to  the  false  misbehavior  attack.  In  order  to  solves  not  only  receiver  collision  and  limited 

transmission power but also the false misbehavior problem to launch Secure IDS architecture. 

Fig 5: False Misbehavior in MANETS 

 

 

 

5.  Secure IDS description 

EAACK  is  consisted  of  three  major  parts,  namely,  ACK,  secure  ACK  (S-ACK),  and  misbehavior  report 

authentication  (MRA).  In  order  to  distinguish  different  packet  types  in  different  schemes  to  include  a  2-b  packet 

header in EAACK. According to the Internet draft of DSR [7], there is 6 b reserved in the DSR header. In EAACK, 

use 2 b of the 6 b to flag different types of packets. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver. 

In this secure IDS, It is assumed that the link between each node in the network is bidirectional. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver.

5.1  ACK:  ACK  is  basically  an  end-to-end  ACK  IDS.  It  acts  as  a  part  of  the  hybrid  IDS  in  EAACK,  aiming  to 

reduce network overhead  when no network  misbehavior is  detected. Consider the scenario source node first sends 

out an ACK data packet to the destination node D. If all the intermediate nodes along the route between nodes S and

D  are  cooperative  and  node  D  successfully  receives  packet,  node  D  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK 

acknowledgment  packet  along  the  same  route  but  in  a  reverse  order.  Within  a  predefined  time  period,  if  node  S 

receives packet, then the packet transmission from node S to node D is successful. Otherwise, node S will switch to 

S-ACK mode by sending out an S-ACK data packet to detect the misbehaving nodes in the route. 

 

5.2  S-ACK:  It  is  an  improved  version  of  the  TWOACK  IDS  [6].  The  principle  is  to  let  every  three  consecutive 

nodes work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive nodes in the route, the third node is 

required to send  

an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the first node.

The  intention  of  introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or 

limited transmission power. 

 

5.3 MRA : Unlike the TWOACK IDS, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, EAACK 

requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to detect 

false  misbehavior.  The  MRA  field  is  designed  to  resolve  the  weakness  of  Watchdog  when  it  fails  to  detect 

misbehaving  nodes  with  the  presence  of  false  misbehavior.  The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by 

malicious attackers to falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. The core of MRA field is to authenticate whether 

the destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, 

the source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If 

there is no other that exists, the source node starts a DSR routing request to find another route. Due to the nature of 

MANETs, it is common to find out multiple routes between two nodes. When the destination node receives an MRA 

packet,  it  searches  its  local  knowledge  base  and  compares  if  the  reported  packet  was  received.  If  it  is  already 

received,  then  it  is  safe  to  conclude  that  this  is  a  false  misbehavior  report  and  whoever  generated  this  report  is 

marked as malicious. Otherwise, the misbehavior report is trusted and accepted. By the adoption of MRA scheme, 

EAACK is capable of detecting malicious nodes despite the existence of false misbehavior report.

5.4  Digital Signature 

As discussed before, EAACK is an acknowledgment-based IDS. All three parts of EAACK, namely, ACK, S-ACK, 

and  MRA,  are  acknowledgment-based  detection  schemes.  They  all  rely  on  acknowledgment  packets  to  detect 

misbehaviors in the network. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that all acknowledgment packets in EAACK 

are authentic and untainted. Otherwise, if the attackers are smart enough to forge acknowledgment packets, all of the 

three  schemes  will  be  vulnerable.  Hybrid  cryptography  technique  Diffie  Hellman  key  exchange  algorithm  is  used 

reduce the network overhead. 

Fig 7: Diffie Hellman Cryptography in MANETS     

 

 

6.  CONCLUSION 

Intrusion- Detection Systems (IDS) for discovering malicious nodes and attacks on MANETs is presented. Due to 

some  special  characteristics  of  MANETs,  prevention  mechanisms  alone  are  not  adequate  to  manage  the  secure 

networks. In this case detection should be focused as another part before an attacker can damage the structure of the 

system. Secure IDS named EAACK protocol specially designed for MANETs and in future it is required to compare 

against other popular mechanisms. Security is major part in MANETS, hybrid architecture will tackle the issue in an 

efficient manner. This way we can better preserve battery and memory space of mobile nodes.

Abstract  :  With  the  various  and  increasingly  malicious  attacks  on  networks  and  wireless  systems,  traditional  security  tools 

such  as  anti-virus  programs  and  firewalls  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  free,  integrated,  reliable  and  secure  networks. 

Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDSs)  are  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network  traffic  to  identify  unauthorized  usage  and  mishandling  of  computer  system  networks.  It  is  critical  to  implement 

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic. Due to the fact that software IDSs are able to 

detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service 

Attacks, because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or 

slow down the performance of systems. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is 

one  of  the  most  important  and  unique  applications.  On  the  contrary  to  traditional  network  architecture,  MANET  does  not 

require  a  fixed  network  infrastructure.  Every  single  node  works  as  both  a  transmitter  and  a  receiver.  Nodes  communicate 

directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to 

relay  messages.  The  self-configuring  ability  of  nodes  in  MANET  made  it  popular  among  critical  mission  applications  like 

military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to 

malicious  attackers.  In  this  case,  it  is  crucial  to  develop  efficient  intrusion-detection  mechanisms  to  protect  MANET  from 

attacks.  In this paper, we propose and implement a hybrid cryptography technique of diffie hell man key exchange algorithm 

with new energy constraint based intrusion-detection system named two tier Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) 

specially  designed  for  MANETs.  Compared  to  contemporary  approaches,  EAACK  demonstrates  higher  malicious-behavior-

detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes equipped with both a wireless transmitter and a 

receiver  that  communicate  with  each  other  via  bidirectional  wireless  links  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Industrial 

remote access and control via wireless networks are becoming more and more popular these days . One of the major 

advantages  of  wireless  networks  is  its  ability  to  allow  data  communication  between  different  parties  and  still 

maintain their  mobility. However, this communication is limited to the range of  transmitters. This  means that two 

nodes cannot communicate with each other when the distance between the two nodes is beyond the communication 

range of their own. MANET solves this problem by allowing intermediate parties to relay data transmissions. This is 

achieved  by  dividing  MANET  into  two  types  of  networks,  namely,  single-hop  and  multihop.  In  a  single-hop 

network,  all  nodes  within  the  same  radio  range  communicate  directly  with  each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  in  a 

multihop  network,  nodes  rely  on  other  intermediate  nodes  to  transmit  if  the  destination  node  is  out  of  their  radio 

range. In contrary to the traditional wireless network, MANET has a decentralized network infrastructure. MANET 

does  not  require  a  fixed  infrastructure;  thus,  all  nodes  are  free  to  move  randomly  [10].  MANET  is  capable  of 

creating  a  self  configuring  and  self-maintaining  network  without  the  help  of  a  centralized  infrastructure,  which  is 

often infeasible in critical mission applications like military conflict or emergency recovery. Minimal configuration 

and  quick  deployment  make  MANET  ready  to  be  used  in  emergency  circumstances  where  an  infrastructure  is 

unavailable  or  unfeasible  to  install  in  scenarios  like  natural  or  human-induced  disasters,  military  conflicts,  and 

medical  emergency  situations  [16].  Owing  to  these  unique  characteristics,  MANET  is  becoming  more  and  more 

widely  implemented  in  the  industry  [14].  However,  considering  the  fact  that  MANET  is  popular  among  critical 

mission  applications,  network  security  is  of  vital  importance.  Unfortunately,  the  open  medium  and  remote 

distribution  of  MANET  make  it  vulnerable  to  various  types  of  attacks.  For  example,  due  to  the  nodes’  lack  of 

physical protection, malicious attackers can easily capture and compromise nodes to achieve attacks. In  particular, 

considering  the  fact  that  most  routing  protocols  in  MANETs  assume  that  every  node  in  the  network  behaves 

cooperatively  with  other  nodes  and  presumably  not  malicious  [5],  attackers  can  easily  compromise  MANETs  by 

inserting  malicious  or  noncooperative  nodes  into  the  network.  Furthermore,  because  of  MANET’s  distributed 

architecture and changing topology, a traditional centralized monitoring technique is no longer feasible in MANETs. 

In such case, it is crucial to develop an intrusion-detection system (IDS). 

Security  is  a  major  concern  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily  life.  New  methods  and  equipment  have  been  devised  to 

ensure privacy. However, computer networks still face many threats [1]. There are usually three stages to achieving 

security in computer system networks: prevention, detection and correction [2]. Prevention is preferable to detection 

and correction, but it is impossible to prevent 100 per cent of attacks [1, 3]. Moreover, detection techniques provide 

more accurate results in detecting malicious attackers than correction techniques. Despite the existence of a variety 

of  security  protection  measures,  an  attacker  often  attempts  to  make  services  merely  unavailable  to  intended 

legitimate  users  [3].  It  is  inadvisable  to  depend  only  on  prevention  techniques,  especially  when  an  attacker  has 

successfully obtained vulnerable information from a network, but prevention can successfully and effectively restore 

a network before an attack is launched. Correction techniques are adopted to protect computer systems. Along with 

prevention, they actively work to block intrusions, but can continue to battle a successful intrusion. Nevertheless, a

number  of  successful  attacks  can  be  controlled  using  prevention  techniques  if  an  attack  is  detected  at  the  interim 

stage of prevention systems. This is difficult, because some successful attacks can get through the prevention system 

[1].  It  is  a  matter  of  a  system  being  attacked,  compromised,  and  consequently  malfunctioning.  Here  we  need  an 

interim  stage  such  as  the  detection  phase,  which  should  be  positive  during  intrusions.  Therefore,  the  detection 

method is preferred to minimize network costs and fill in the gap between correction and prevention mechanisms. 

Intrusion  Detection  (ID)  is  one  of  the  most  tested  and  reliable  technologies  to  monitor  incoming  and  outgoing 

network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks [3, 4]. In addition, ID 

identifies the activity of malicious attackers. Due to the fact that numerous computer systems are unable to prevent 

threats such as flood attacks, DoS(denial of service) attacks affect many systems, because the impact of such attacks 

is severe and irrevocable. The main function of these kinds of attacks is to send more high-speed traffic to a network 

address, which stops or slows down the performance of legitimate users’ computer network systems by exploiting 

vulnerabilities  such  as  misconfigurations  and  software  bugs  generated  from  internal  and  external  networks.  It  is 

critical to implement ID systems (IDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic . IDSs consist of either software 

applications  or  hardware  to  listen  for  and  detect  malicious  activities  at  the  gateways  (incoming  and  outgoing)  of 

individual or network systems.  

 

2.  BACKGROUND 

  
2.1 Security Products: Security products such as firewalls and antivirus programs are less efficient than IDSs and 

have different  functionalities. IDSs analyse collected  information and infer  more  useful results than other  security 

products. The difference between IDSs and security products such as antivirus programs is that, while IDSs require 

more intelligence than security product software, they analyse gathered information and deduce useful results [1]. 

 

2.1.1 Firewall Technology 

Network  traffic  is  usually  filtered  according  to  criteria  such  as  origin,  destination,  protocol  and  service,  typically 

through  dedicated  routers  called  firewalls  [1].  The  functionality  of  the  firewall  is  based  on  filtering  mechanisms 

specified  by  a  set  of  rules,  known  as  a  policy,  which  can  protect  a  system  from  flooding  attacks  [1].  The  basic 

operation of firewalls is to filter packets passing through specific hosts or network ports, which are usually open in 

most  computer  systems  [1].  It  does  not  perform  deep  analysis  (malicious  code  detection  in  the  packet)  and  treats 

each  packet  as  an  individual  entity  [1].  The  disadvantage  of  a  firewall  is  that  it  cannot  fully  protect  an  internal 

network; it is unable to stop internal attacks [1, 6]. For example, malicious and unwanted web traffic can go through 

a firewall to strike and damage a protected computer system without a hitch. 

 
2.1.2 Anti-virus technology 
Computer viruses are programs  which cause computer  failure and damage computer data. Especially in a  network 

environment, a computer virus poses an immeasurable threat and can be very destructive [6]. The functionality of an 

anti-virus  program  is  a  running  process  that  examines  executables,  worms  and  viruses  in  the  memory  of  guarded 

computer/network  systems  instead  of  monitoring  network  traffic.  Although  an  anti-virus  program  monitors  the

integrity of data files against illegal modifications, it is unable to block unwanted network traffic intended to damage 

the network. [7]. 

 

2.1.3  IDS technology 

Firewalls  have  been  used  for  network  security  for  a  long  time,  but  they  can  be  easily  bypassed,  as  a  lot  of  

techniques  for deceiving  firewalls have been developed [8]. IDSs are much  more advanced and enhanced security 

tools than firewalls, because a firewall just drops packets—it cannot detect intrusion [1]. In addition, it is difficult to 

detect suspicious activities in the midst of high traffic and other such adverse circumstances in the network, which 

results in an inaccurate detection mechanism. IDSs are still unable to control all threats and malicious activities [1, 

9]. To overcome such design and implementation difficulties, novel IDS outcomes have been obtained from multiple 

characteristics  of  advanced  computer  networks:  Processing  in  real  time;  High  speeds  and  high  loads;  Reducing 

difficulties for defenders; and Increasing difficulties for attackers. The specialized IDS mechanism is based on how, 

where and what it detects, along with mandatory requirements. In particular, IDSs should be based on flexible and 

scalable  network  components  to  accommodate  the  drastic  increase  in  today’s  network  environments.  They  should 

provide  straightforward  management  and  operational  procedures  and  steps  rather  than  complicating  underlying 

tasks, and they should provide user-friendly ID mechanisms. 

 

2.2  IDS in MANETs 

As discussed before, due to the limitations of most MANET routing protocols, nodes in MANETs assume that other 

nodes always cooperate with each other to relay data. This assumption leaves the attackers with the opportunities to 

achieve significant impact on the network with just one or two compromised nodes. To address this problem, an IDS 

should be added to enhance the security level of MANETs. If MANET can detect the attackers as soon as they enter 

the network, we will be able to completely eliminate the potential damages caused by compromised nodes at the first 

time.  IDSs  usually  act  as  the  second  layer  in  MANETs,  and  they  are  a  great  complement  to  existing  proactive 

approaches. Anantvalee and Wu [4] presented a very thorough survey on contemporary IDSs in MANETs. In this 

section,  we  mainly  describe  three  existing  approaches,  namely,  Watchdog,  TWOACK  [15],  and  Adaptive 

ACKnowledgment (AACK). 

  

2.2.1 Watchdog: Marti et al. proposed a scheme named Watchdog that aims to improve the throughput of network 

with  the  presence  of  malicious  nodes.  In  fact,  the  Watchdog  scheme  is  consisted  of  two  parts,  namely,  Watchdog 

and Path rater. Watchdog serves as an IDS for MANETs. It is responsible for detecting malicious node misbehaviors 

in the network. Watchdog detects malicious misbehaviors by promiscuously listening to its next hop’s transmission. 

If  a  Watchdog  node  overhears  that  its  next  node  fails  to  forward  the  packet  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  it 

increases its failure counter. Whenever a node’s failure counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the Watchdog node 

reports  it  as  misbehaving.  In  this  case,  the  Pathrater  cooperates  with  the  routing  protocols  to  avoid  the  reported 

nodes in future transmission. Many following research studies and implementations have proved that the Watchdog 

scheme  is  efficient.  Furthermore,  compared  to  some  other  schemes,  Watchdog  is  capable  of  detecting  malicious

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

nodes  rather  than  links.  These  advantages  have  made  the  Watchdog  scheme  a  popular  choice  in  the  field.  Many 

MANET IDSs are either based on or developed as an improvement to the Watchdog scheme [15]. Nevertheless, as 

pointed out by Marti et al. [16], the Watchdog scheme fails to detect malicious misbehaviors with the presence of 

the  following: 1)  ambiguous  collisions; 2) receiver collisions; 3) limited transmission power; 4)  false  misbehavior 

report; 5) collusion; and 6) partial dropping.  

2.2.2  TWOACK:  With  respect  to  the  six  weaknesses  of  the  Watchdog  scheme,  many  researchers  proposed  new 

approaches  to  solve  these  issues.  TWOACK  proposed  by  Liu  et  al.  [16]  is  one  of  the  most  important  approaches 

among them. On Fig. 1. TWOACK scheme: Each node is  required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the 

node that is two hops away from it. The contrary to many other schemes, TWOACK is neither an enhancement nor a 

Watchdog-based  scheme.  Aiming  to  resolve  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  of 

Watchdog, TWOACK detects misbehaving links by acknowledging every data packet transmitted over every three 

consecutive nodes along the path from the source to the destination. Upon retrieval of a packet, each node along the 

route is required to send back an acknowledgment packet to the node that is two hops away from it down the route. 

TWOACK  is  required  to  work  on  routing  protocols  such  as  Dynamic  Source  Routing  (DSR)  [11].  The  working 

process  of  TWOACK  is  shown  in  Fig.  1:  Node  X  first  forwards  Packet  1  to  node  Y,  and  then,  node  Y  forwards 

Packet  1  to  node  Z.  When  node  Z  receives  Packet  1,  as  it  is  two  hops  away  from  node  X,  node  Z  is  obliged  to 

generate a TWOACK packet, which contains reverse route from node X to node Z, and sends it back to node X. The 

retrieval of this TWOACK packet at node X indicates that the transmission of Packet 1 from node X to node Z is 

successful. Otherwise, if this TWOACK packet is not received in a predefined time period, both nodes Y and Z are 

reported  malicious.  The  same  process  applies  to  every  three  consecutive  nodes  along  the  rest  of  the  route.  The 

TWOACK  scheme  successfully  solves  the  receiver  collision  and  limited  transmission  power  problems  posed  by 

Watchdog. However, the acknowledgment process required in every packet transmission process added 

a  significant  amount  of  unwanted  network  overhead.  Due  to  the  limited  battery  power  nature  of  MANETs,  such 

redundant transmission process can easily degrade the life span of the entire network.

2.2.3 AACK: Based on TWOACK, Sheltami et al.  proposed a new scheme called AACK. Similar to TWOACK, 

AACK is an acknowledgment-based network layer scheme which can be considered as a combination of a scheme 

called  TACK  (identical  to  TWOACK)  and  an  end-to  end  acknowledgment  scheme  called  ACKnowledge  (ACK). 

Compared to TWOACK, AACK significantly reduced network overhead while still capable of maintaining or even 

surpassing the same network throughput. The end-to-end acknowledgment scheme in ACK is shown in Fig. 2. In the 

ACK  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  source  node  A  sends  out  Packet  1  without  any  overhead  except  2  b  of  flag 

indicating  the  packet  type.  All  the  intermediate  nodes  simply  forward  this  packet.  When  the  destination  node  B 

receives  Packet  1,  it  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK  acknowledgment  packet  to  the  source  node  A  along  the 

reverse order of the  same route. 

Fig 2: END-to-END ACK IDS for MANETS 

 

 

Within a predefined time period, if the source  node A receives this ACK acknowledgment packet, then the  packet 

transmission from node A to node B is successful. Otherwise, the source node A will switch to TACK scheme by 

sending  out  a  TACK  packet.  The  concept  of  adopting  a  hybrid  scheme  in  AACK  greatly  reduces  the  network 

overhead, but both TWOACK and AACK still suffer from the problem that they fail to detect malicious nodes with 

the presence of false misbehavior report and forged acknowledgment packets. In fact, many of the existing IDSs in 

MANETs  adopt  an  acknowledgment-based  scheme,  including  TWOACK  and  AACK.  The  functions  of  such 

detection  schemes  all  largely  depend  on  the  acknowledgment  packets.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  guarantee  that  the 

acknowledgment  packets  are  valid  and  authentic.  To  address  this  concern,  we  adopt  a  digital  signature  in  our 

proposed scheme named Enhanced AACK (EAACK). 

 

3.1 ACK 

3.  EXISTING SYSTEM 

As discussed before, ACK is basically an end-to-end acknowledgment scheme. It acts as a part of the hybrid scheme 

in EAACK, aiming to reduce network overhead when no network misbehavior  is detected. In ACK mode, node A 

first  sends  out  an  ACK  data  packet  P1  to  the  destination  node  B.  If  all  the  intermediate  nodes  along  the  route 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1183 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

between  nodes  A  and  B  are  cooperative  and  node B  successfully  receives  P1,  node B  is required  to  send  back  an 

ACK acknowledgment packet ACK along the same route but in a reverse order. Within a predefined time period, if 

node A receives ACK, then the packet transmission from node A to node B is successful. 

Otherwise,  node  S  will  switch  to  S-ACK  mode  by  sending  out  an  S-ACK  data  packet  to  detect  the  misbehaving 

nodes in the route. 

3.2  S-ACK 

The S-ACK scheme is an improved version of the TWOACK scheme proposed by Liu et at. The principle is to let 

every three consecutive nodes  work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive  nodes in 

the route, the third node is required to send an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the  first node. The intention of 

introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or  limited 

transmission power. 

S-ACK mode, the three consecutive nodes (i.e., X , Y, and Z) work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes in the 

network. Node X first sends out S-ACK data packet Psad1 to node Y. Then, node Y forwards this packet to node Z. 

When node Z receives Psad1, as it is the third node in this three-node group, node F3 is required to send back an S-

ACK acknowledgment packet Psak1 to node Y. Node Y forwards Psak1 back to node X. If node X does not receive 

this  acknowledgment  packet  within  a  predefined  time  period,  both  nodes  Y  and  Z  are  reported  as  malicious. 

Moreover, a misbehavior report will be generated by node X and sent to the source node A. Nevertheless, unlike the 

TWOACK scheme, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, 

EAACK requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to 

detect false misbehavior report in our proposed scheme. 

3. 3  MRA 

The MRA scheme is designed to resolve the weakness of Watchdog when it fails to detect misbehaving nodes with 

the  presence  of  false  misbehavior  report. The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by  malicious  attackers  to 

falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. This attack can be lethal to the entire network when the attackers break 

down sufficient nodes and thus cause a network division. The core of MRA scheme is to authenticate  whether the 

destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, the 

source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If there 

is  no  other  that  exists,  the  source  node  starts  a  DSR  routing  request  to  find  another  route.  Due  to  the  nature  of 

MANETs,  it  is  common  to  find  out  multiple  routes  between  two  nodes.  By  adopting  an  alternative  route  to  the 

destination  node,  we  circumvent  the  misbehavior  reporter  node.  When  the  destination  node  receives  an  MRA 

packet, it searches its local knowledge 

 

4.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

Secure IDS architecture (EAACK) introduced to improve the security level of MANETs based on security attributes 

and  various  algorithms,  namely  RSA  and  DSA.  EAACK  is  designed  to  tackle  three  out  of  six  weaknesses  of 

Watchdog IDS, namely, 1) Receiver collision, 2) Limited transmission power, 3) False misbehavior. 

© 2014, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved                                                                                                        1184 
 

Asha N et al, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.3 Issue.5, May- 2014, pg. 1178-1190 

4.1 Receiver collisions: Example of receiver collisions, shown in Fig. 3, after node X sends Packet 1 to node Y, it 

tries to overhear if node Y forwarded this packet to node Z; meanwhile, node F is forwarding Packet 2 to node Z. In 

such case, node X overhears that node Y has successfully forwarded Packet 1 to node Z but failed to detect that node 

Z did not receive this packet due to a collision between Packet 1 and Packet 2 at node Z. 

Fig 3: Receiver collision in MANETS 

 

 
4.2  Limited  transmission  power:  In  order  to  manage  the  battery  resources  in  MANETs,  node  Y  limits  its 

transmission power so it is very strong to be overheard by node X after transmitting the packet (P1) to node Z, but 

too weak to reach node Z because of transmission power can be reduced. 

Fig 4: Limited Transmission Power in MANETS 

 

3)False  misbehavior:  Example  of  false  misbehavior  in  MANETs,  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Even  though  node  X  and  Y 

forwarded Packet 1 to node Z successfully, node X still inform node Y as  misbehaving, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to 

the open medium and remote distribution of typical MANETs, attackers can easily capture and compromise one or 

two nodes to achieve this false misbehavior report attack. As discussed in previous sections, TWOACK and AACK 

solve two of these three weaknesses, namely, receiver collision and limited transmission power. However, both of

them  are  vulnerable  to  the  false  misbehavior  attack.  In  order  to  solves  not  only  receiver  collision  and  limited 

transmission power but also the false misbehavior problem to launch Secure IDS architecture. 

Fig 5: False Misbehavior in MANETS 

 

 

 

5.  Secure IDS description 

EAACK  is  consisted  of  three  major  parts,  namely,  ACK,  secure  ACK  (S-ACK),  and  misbehavior  report 

authentication  (MRA).  In  order  to  distinguish  different  packet  types  in  different  schemes  to  include  a  2-b  packet 

header in EAACK. According to the Internet draft of DSR [7], there is 6 b reserved in the DSR header. In EAACK, 

use 2 b of the 6 b to flag different types of packets. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver. 

In this secure IDS, It is assumed that the link between each node in the network is bidirectional. 

Furthermore, for each communication process, both the source node and the destination node are not malicious. All 

acknowledgment packets are required to be digitally signed by its sender and verified by its receiver.

5.1  ACK:  ACK  is  basically  an  end-to-end  ACK  IDS.  It  acts  as  a  part  of  the  hybrid  IDS  in  EAACK,  aiming  to 

reduce network overhead  when no network  misbehavior is  detected. Consider the scenario source node first sends 

out an ACK data packet to the destination node D. If all the intermediate nodes along the route between nodes S and

D  are  cooperative  and  node  D  successfully  receives  packet,  node  D  is  required  to  send  back  an  ACK 

acknowledgment  packet  along  the  same  route  but  in  a  reverse  order.  Within  a  predefined  time  period,  if  node  S 

receives packet, then the packet transmission from node S to node D is successful. Otherwise, node S will switch to 

S-ACK mode by sending out an S-ACK data packet to detect the misbehaving nodes in the route. 

 

5.2  S-ACK:  It  is  an  improved  version  of  the  TWOACK  IDS  [6].  The  principle  is  to  let  every  three  consecutive 

nodes work in a group to detect misbehaving nodes. For every three consecutive nodes in the route, the third node is 

required to send  

an S-ACK acknowledgment packet to the first node.

The  intention  of  introducing  S-ACK  mode  is  to  detect  misbehaving  nodes  in  the  presence  of  receiver  collision  or 

limited transmission power. 

 

5.3 MRA : Unlike the TWOACK IDS, where the source node immediately trusts the misbehavior report, EAACK 

requires the source node to switch to MRA mode and confirm this misbehavior report. This is a vital step to detect 

false  misbehavior.  The  MRA  field  is  designed  to  resolve  the  weakness  of  Watchdog  when  it  fails  to  detect 

misbehaving  nodes  with  the  presence  of  false  misbehavior.  The  false  misbehavior  report  can  be  generated  by 

malicious attackers to falsely report innocent nodes as malicious. The core of MRA field is to authenticate whether 

the destination node has received the reported missing packet through a different route. To initiate the MRA mode, 

the source node first searches its local knowledge base and seeks for an alternative route to the destination node. If 

there is no other that exists, the source node starts a DSR routing request to find another route. Due to the nature of 

MANETs, it is common to find out multiple routes between two nodes. When the destination node receives an MRA 

packet,  it  searches  its  local  knowledge  base  and  compares  if  the  reported  packet  was  received.  If  it  is  already 

received,  then  it  is  safe  to  conclude  that  this  is  a  false  misbehavior  report  and  whoever  generated  this  report  is 

marked as malicious. Otherwise, the misbehavior report is trusted and accepted. By the adoption of MRA scheme, 

EAACK is capable of detecting malicious nodes despite the existence of false misbehavior report.

5.4  Digital Signature 

As discussed before, EAACK is an acknowledgment-based IDS. All three parts of EAACK, namely, ACK, S-ACK, 

and  MRA,  are  acknowledgment-based  detection  schemes.  They  all  rely  on  acknowledgment  packets  to  detect 

misbehaviors in the network. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that all acknowledgment packets in EAACK 

are authentic and untainted. Otherwise, if the attackers are smart enough to forge acknowledgment packets, all of the 

three  schemes  will  be  vulnerable.  Hybrid  cryptography  technique  Diffie  Hellman  key  exchange  algorithm  is  used 

reduce the network overhead.

6.  CONCLUSION 

Intrusion- Detection Systems (IDS) for discovering malicious nodes and attacks on MANETs is presented. Due to 

some  special  characteristics  of  MANETs,  prevention  mechanisms  alone  are  not  adequate  to  manage  the  secure 

networks. In this case detection should be focused as another part before an attacker can damage the structure of the 

system. Secure IDS named EAACK protocol specially designed for MANETs and in future it is required to compare 

against other popular mechanisms. Security is major part in MANETS, hybrid architecture will tackle the issue in an 

efficient manner. This way we can better preserve battery and memory space of mobile nodes.
